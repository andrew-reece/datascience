Ultimately he felt he spent more time fighting the organization than doing something interesting and creative.                 16,1E+14,1,Article,News,The 10 Best Books of 2013,Books,729,5.948,5.455,   By turns tender and trenchant AdichieÂ€Â™s third novel takes on the comedy and tragedy of American race relations from the perspective of a young Nigerian immigrant. From the office politics of a hair-braiding salon to the burden of memory thereÂ€Â™s nothing too humble or daunting for this fearless writer who is so attuned to the various worlds and shifting selves we inhabit Â€Â” in life and online in love as agents and victims of history and the heroes of our own stories.          Radical politics avant-garde art and motorcycle racing all spring to life in KushnerÂ€Â™s radiant novel of the 1970s in which a young woman moves to New York to become an artist only to wind up involved in the revolutionary protest movement that shook Italy in those years. The novel KushnerÂ€Â™s second deploys mordant observations and chiseled sentences to explore how individuals are swept along by implacable social forces.          TarttÂ€Â™s intoxicating third novel after Â€ÂœThe Secret HistoryÂ€Âù and Â€ÂœThe Little FriendÂ€Âù follows the travails of Theo Decker who emerges from a terrorist bombing motherless but in possession of a prized Dutch painting. Like the best of Dickens the novel is packed with incident and populated with vivid characters. At its heart is the unwavering belief that come what may art can save us by lifting us above ourselves.          Demonstrating the agile style and theatrical bravado of her much-admired Jackson Brodie mystery novels Atkinson takes on nothing less than the evils of mid-20th-century history and the nature of death as she moves back and forth in time fitting together versions of a life story for a heroine who keeps dying then being resurrected Â€Â” and sent off in different but entirely plausible directions.          SaundersÂ€Â™s wickedly entertaining stories veer from the deadpan to the flat-out demented: Prisoners are force-fed mood-altering drugs; ordinary saps cling to delusions of grandeur; third-world women held aloft on surgical wire become the latest in bourgeois lawn ornaments. Beneath the comedy though Saunders writes with profound empathy and this impressive collection advances his abiding interest in questions of class power and justice.           BlinderÂ€Â™s terrific book on the financial meltdown of 2008 argues that it happened because of a Â€Âœperfect stormÂ€Âù in which many unfortunate events occurred simultaneously producing a far worse outcome than would have resulted from just a single cause. Blinder criticizes both the Bush and Obama administrations especially for letting Lehman Brothers fail but he also praises them for taking steps to save the country from falling into a serious depression. Their response to the near disaster Blinder says was far better than the public realizes.          Baker succeeds in telling the story of the several crises of the Bush administration with fairness and balance which is to say that he is sympathetic to his subjects acknowledging their accomplishments but excusing none of their errors. Baker the chief White House correspondent for The Times is fascinated by the mystery of the Bush-Ã‚Â_Cheney relationship and even more so by the mystery of George W. Bush himself. Did Bush lead or was he led by others? In the end Baker concludes the Â€ÂœdeciderÂ€Âù really did decide.          In harrowing detail Fink describes the hellish days at a hospital during and after Hurricane Katrina when desperate medical professionals were suspected of administering lethal injections to critically ill patients. Masterfully and compassionately reported and as gripping as a thriller the book poses reverberating questions about end-of-life care race discrimination in medicine and how individuals and institutions break down during disasters.          Clark manages in a single volume to provide a comprehensive highly readable survey of the events leading up to World War I. He avoids singling out any one nation or leader as the guilty party. Â€ÂœThe outbreak of warÂ€Âù he writes Â€Âœis not an Agatha Christie drama at the end of which we will discover the culprit standing over a corpse.Â€Âù The participants were in his term Â€ÂœsleepwalkersÂ€Âù not fanatics or murderers and the war itself was a tragedy not a crime.          On the day after Christmas in 2004 Deraniyagala called her husband to the window of their hotel room in Sri Lanka. Â€ÂœI want to show you something oddÂ€Âù she said. The ocean looked foamy and closer than usual. Within moments it was upon them. Deraniyagala lost her husband her parents and two young sons to the Indian Ocean tsunami. Her survival was miraculous and so too is this memoir Â€Â” unsentimental raggedly intimate full of fury.        67,1E+14,0,Article,News,News From the Advertising Industry,Business Day,825,5.792,5.682, Â–Â  Volvo Car Group owned by the Zhejiang Geely Holding Group chose new agencies for worldwide creative and digital assignments with spending estimated at $300 million.

Magna Global part of the IPG Mediabrands division of the Interpublic Group of Companies revised its prediction upward. It is now forecasting a gain of 6.5 percent in worldwide ad spending next year compared with 2013; the previous Magna Global forecast called for an increase of 6.1 percent. The Magna Global prediction for growth next year is also at a faster pace than its prediction for this year which calls for an increase of 3.2 percent compared with 2012.

In Game 7 of last yearÂ€Â™s Eastern Conference finals the Heat trounced the Pacers 99-76 the largest margin of the series.         Indiana has improved since that game. Paul George has  The depth issue seems to have been resolved.Ã‚Â Though Danny Granger is still trying to return from a leg injury that has sidelined him this season three Pacers backups represent a significant improvement from last year.Ã‚Â Luis Scola acquired from the Suns has given the bench an infusion of toughness and scoring and the backup point guards C. J. Watson and Donald Sloan have played well.         Perhaps the PacersÂ€Â™ most important off-season move was re-signing the veteran forward David West.Ã‚Â West and Roy Hibbert caused all kinds of trouble for Miami last season forming a potent high-low combination and preventing the Heat from getting into the lane easily.         But the Pacers are having trouble shaking their ball-control problem something that should have been high among their priorities after they averaged 17.5 turnovers in their losses to the Heat in the conference finals including 21 in Game 7.Ã‚Â Those stats followed a season in which the Pacers averaged 14.5 turnovers a game.Ã‚Â Despite their improvements in so many other categories this season the Pacers are turning the ball over even more frequently at an average of 15.8 times a game. They will be especially vulnerable against the Heat who force more turnovers than any other team in the league.         The Pacers strength in the lane should challenge the Heat who have been struggling to defend inside. In recent losses to Chicago and Detroit the Heat allowed a combined 104 points in the paint. If the PacersÂ€Â™ offense which thrives on the extra pass to the post can overcome its tendency for turnovers it will be able to exploit MiamiÂ€Â™s weakness inside.         MiamiÂ€Â™s roster is largely unchanged from last year.Ã‚Â While the Heat offense and Pacer defense will make for compelling basketball on one end of the court the difference on Tuesday night could be the other side where the Pacers may have a slim advantage.

Although my husband Mel was a wonderful person he had weaknesses as all of us do. To ignore these would have been to paint a picture of a saint. He would have never wanted that.         Ironically I ended up being harder on myself revealing my fear and anger about the fact that I was losing him which led to my saying things I would give anything to be able to erase. To my surprise I found that readers felt validated by learning that their Â€ÂœshamefulÂ€Âù feelings were shared.         What needs to be saved for a later memoir is the guilt that can pervade you when youÂ€Â™ve had a success built on the death of someone you loved.

ANNE HOSANSKY  79,1E+14,0,Article,Letter,Minimum Wage Studies,Opinion,297,6.034,5.507, Arindrajit DubeÂ€Â™s recent article in the Â€ÂœGreat DivideÂ€Âù series (Â€Âœ In particular Mr. Dube dismisses a large body of research that finds disemployment effects from the minimum wage. He bases his conclusions largely on his own work without noting that we and other researchers strongly contest his research methodology and conclusions. We find negative employment effects from minimum wages using a variety of methods including ones that address his contention that different employment trajectories between high- and low-minimum-wage states skew the evidence toward finding disemployment effects.         Further Mr. Dube cites only his own research in asserting that a higher minimum wage in the United States reduces poverty. He makes no mention of contradictory research by Richard V. Burkhauser Joseph J. Sabia and us which finds that minimum wage increases have not had a measurable effect on poverty.         The debate on these issues is still playing out and future research will help sort out the answers.         Mr. Dube also argues incorrectly in our view that the minimum wage should be higher simply because it is lower in real terms than it used to be. The United States has adopted the earned-income tax credit as an alternative policy to increase incomes of low-wage workers a policy that better targets those benefits to low-income families.         DAVID NEUMARK 10,1E+14,0,Article,News,Lessons From the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill,Booming,782,5.244,5.379, As oil disasters go the 1989 Exxon Valdez grounding and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon blowout were about as different as two spills could be.         One wasnÂ€Â™t even technically a spill. When the Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico it uncorked a gusher a mile down at the seabed. This subsea torrent of oil turned out to be far greater than the amount of crude that leaked from the damaged Exxon Valdez onto the surface of Prince William Sound Â€Â“ about 200 million gallons compared with 11 million Â€Â“ and it posed a different set of problems for BP and government officials.         In cleaning up an oil spill a main goal is to separate the oil from the water Â€Â“ like skimming the fat off a bowl of gravy. In the gulf disaster it didnÂ€Â™t help that cleanup technologies like booms and skimmers had changed little over two decades. But the fact that the oil spewed into the deep gulf waters and spread out over a wide area before it reached the surface made containing and collecting the oil even harder.         As a result the government allowed BP to try something new: injecting chemical dispersants into the plume of oil at the seabed. Ordinarily dispersants help break surface oil into tiny droplets that sink into the water column where they can be degraded by bacteria. That was the goal in Prince William Sound. In the gulf the hope was that the chemicals would keep the oil from reaching the surface.         It is unclear how effective the technique was and subsequent studies have suggested that the large amount of dispersants Â€Â” close to two million gallons in all far more than in any other spill Â€Â” might have left their own detrimental environmental effects.         For BP the cleanup was only half the battle. The Exxon Valdez carried a huge but finite amount of oil while the gulf well could have continued gushing for months or years if it wasnÂ€Â™t stopped. That is where BP the rest of the industry and the government were really unprepared. They had no experience in trying to control a deepwater blowout. The well was only 5000 feet away but because no human could reach it it might as well have been on Mars.         Technology had failed BPÂ€Â™s engineers. The subsea blowout preventer Â€Â” the enormous array of pipes and valves that sat atop the well at the seabed Â€Â” had not done its job during the initial emergency and in the first few days of the disaster all the remotely operated submersibles in the world could not get it to shut the gusher down.         That left the engineers and well-control specialists to attempt jury-rigged solutions. For months none of these efforts Â€Â” with nicknames like Â€Âœjunk shotÂ€Âù Â€Âœtop killÂ€Âù and Â€Âœtop hatÂ€Âù Â€Â” worked. What eventually did tame the well was a large Â€Âœcapping stackÂ€Âù that fit snugly atop the blowout preventer. To the engineersÂ€Â™ credit they had thought of this early on. When I met with some of them at BP in Houston two weeks into the disaster the idea of such a device was mentioned but it took two months to design and build it.         After that experience most of the major companies that drill in the gulf including BP formed an independent company to come up with equipment and procedures for dealing with future spills. The company Marine Well Containment has built an all-purpose capping stack and other equipment and more work is planned. The idea is to have the equipment ready along with people trained to use it should another deep-sea blowout occur.         Then again the next disaster may be completely different just as the Deepwater Horizon disaster was from the Exxon Valdez.         18,1E+14,0,Article,An Analysis,Week 14 N.F.L. Quick Hits: Reviewing a Call of Pass Interference,Sports,1842,5.31,5.511, Bill Belichick made headlines in the days leading up to this game when he said that the N.F.L. should make all plays subject to challenge. After the PatriotsÂ€Â™ highly improbable comeback Sunday Browns Coach Rob Chudzinski would probably concur.         Tom BradyÂ€Â™s game-winning touchdown pass to Danny Amendola was set up by a  The idea that judgment calls canÂ€Â™t be reviewed was instituted back when replay itself was first instituted. At the time the league had reason to worry that replays would make for bad television viewing and cast an unfriendly spotlight on officials.         As it turned out HD television came around and brought to life all the details you could want in instant replay. Though the whole review process takes too long fans for the most part enjoy the debate and scrutiny of it. ThatÂ€Â™s why for example the former head of league officials Mike Pereira has found a second career working as a replay analyst for Fox.         And as for the unfriendly spotlight on officials that the league was probably worried about well itÂ€Â™s here regardless. In fact as this write-up (and countless others) prove that spotlight can be harsher when plays arenÂ€Â™t reviewable. Maybe not every play should be reviewable as Belichick proposes but officials should have the opportunity to correct their mistakes on pass interference.          If youÂ€Â™re inclined to fill out a Pro Bowl ballot make sure you check the box for Dolphins tight end Charles Clay. The third-year pro has been the only true source of versatility for MiamiÂ€Â™s offense. His 97 yards and 2 touchdowns receiving were the difference in the win at snowy Pittsburgh just as his 91 yards and touchdown were the difference in MiamiÂ€Â™s win over San Diego four weeks ago. Clay has over 80 yards in three of his last four outings and if he accelerates his pace just a bit these final three weeks he could push for a 1000-yard season.          Not to be a Scrooge but hereÂ€Â™s one voice wishing the N.F.L. had postponed or at least delayed the Eagles-Lions Winter Wonderland affair on Sunday. Yes it was sort of fun watching both teams pummel each other in the snow. But it wasnÂ€Â™t football. The field could barely be seen let alone navigated with any semblance of grace or agility. And not that it should matter from the N.F.L.'s standpoint but these happened to be two teams built exactly the opposite of how youÂ€Â™d build a team for playing in the snow. The Eagles and the Lions have finesse offenses and defenses that hinge on linemen being able to fire off the ball. None of those factors were in play Sunday; few actual football factors were.          The talk was about whether the Packers should just shut down Aaron Rodgers for the season. But with DetroitÂ€Â™s loss and Green BayÂ€Â™s win if Rodgers returns in Week 15 (big if) heÂ€Â™ll be doing so for a team thatÂ€Â™s just a half-game out of first place in the N.F.C. North. It almost wasnÂ€Â™t that way as the three-win Falcons gave the Packers a good fight. The Falcons had a chance to attempt a go-ahead field goal but on fourth-and-5 tight end Tony Gonzalez for one of the few times in his Hall of Fame career failed to make a contested catch. Give credit to Packers backup utility defensive back Jarrett Bush who had blanket coverage. Bush also had the game-sealing interception on Matt RyanÂ€Â™s desperation heave a few minutes later.          And  97,1E+14,1,Article,Obituary (Obit),"Doris Lessing, Author Who Swept Aside Convention, Is Dead at 94",Books,655,5.693,5.626, Her death was confirmed by her publisher HarperCollins.         Ms. Lessing produced dozens of novels short stories essays and poems drawing on a childhood in the Central African bush the teachings of Eastern mystics and involvement with grass-roots Communist groups. She embarked on dizzying and at times stultifying literary experiments.         But it was her breakthrough novel Â€ÂœThe Golden NotebookÂ€Âù a structurally inventive and loosely autobiographical tale that remained her best-known work. The 1962 book was daring in its day for its frank exploration of the inner lives of women who unencumbered by marriage were free to raise children or not and pursue work and their sex lives as they chose. The book dealt openly with topics like menstruation and orgasm as well as with the mechanics of emotional breakdown.         Her editor at HarperCollins Nicholas Pearson said on Sunday that Â€ÂœThe Golden NotebookÂ€Âù had been a handbook for a whole generation.         As a writer from colonial Africa to modern London Ms. Lessing scrutinized relationships between men and women social inequities and racial divisions. As a woman she pursued her own interests and desires professional political and sexual. Seeking what she considered a free life she abandoned two young children. Still Salon in an interview with Ms. Lessing in 1997 said that Â€Âœwith her center-parted hair thatÂ€Â™s pulled back into a bun and her steely eyes she seems like a tightly wound earth mother.Â€Âù         It was this figure 10 years later who arrived at her house in sensible shoes to find journalists gathered at her door waiting to tell her that she had won  The Nobel announcement called her Â€Âœthe epicist of the female experience who with skepticism fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilization to scrutiny.Â€Âù         And in the presentation speech at the Nobel ceremonies in Stockholm Ms. Lessing was described as having Â€Âœpersonified the womanÂ€Â™s role in the 20th century.Â€Âù (She accepted the prize at a ceremony in London.)         The cavalier and curmudgeonly Ms. Lessing was making headlines again a few days after the announcement dismissing the Sept. 11 2001 attacks in the United States as Â€Âœnot that terribleÂ€Âù compared to the toll from decades of Irish Republican Army violence.          Â€ÂœThe Golden NotebookÂ€Âù which critics generally consider her best novel has been published in many languages and 50 years after it first appeared it is still in print. It consists of a conventional novel Â€ÂœFree WomenÂ€Âù and several notebooks each in a different color kept by the protagonist Anna Wulf a novelist struggling with writerÂ€Â™s block.         The black notebook deals with Africa and the novel Anna wrote from her experiences there; the red notebook chronicles her Communist Party days; the yellow is an autobiographical novel within the larger novel; the blue is a diary of sorts. The golden notebook at the end brings together ideas and thoughts from the other sections.         Ms. Lessing wrote that she had intended the novel to capture the chaotic period after the Soviet Union officially renounced Stalinism. Under the pressure of the revelations about StalinÂ€Â™s crimes the movement that had been the glue of her social and intellectual circle came undone.         She considered the novel to be a triumph of structure. By fragmenting the story she said she wanted to show the danger of compartmentalizing oneÂ€Â™s thinking the idea that Â€Âœany kind of single-mindedness narrowness obsession was bound to lead to mental disorder if not madness.Â€Âù         But her book was seen as a feminist work a response that irritated her. Even though her novels and stories were filled with the issues at the core of the feminist movement Ms. Lessing had sharp words for feminists.         Speaking at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan in 1970 during the Vietnam War she told her audience Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™ve got the feeling that the sex war is not the most important war going on nor is it the most vital problem in our lives.Â€Âù In 1994 she was no less critical. Â€ÂœThings have changed for white middle-class womenÂ€Âù she said Â€Âœbut nothing has changed outside this group.Â€Âù        89,1E+14,1,Article,News,â€˜60 Minutesâ€™ Airs Apology on Benghazi,Business Day,519,5.558,5.164, Ms. Logan said that Dylan Davies one of the main sources for a two-week-old piece about the attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi Libya had misled the programÂ€Â™s staff when he gave an account of rushing to the compound the night the attack took place. Â€ÂœIt was a mistake to include him in our report. For that we are very sorryÂ€Âù Ms. Logan said.         The apology lasted only 90 seconds and revealed nothing new about why  While veteran television journalists spent the weekend debating whether the now-discredited Benghazi report would cause long-term damage to the esteemed newsmagazineÂ€Â™s brand some media critics joined the liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America in calling for CBS to initiate an independent investigation of missteps in the reporting process.         But the CBS News chairman Jeff Fager who is also the executive producer of Â€Âœ60 MinutesÂ€Âù has not ordered an investigation and on Sunday a spokesman indicated that the program was going to let its televised apology be its last word on the issue.         However the apology was  Â€ÂœAside from the fact that it struck a very passive tone and pushed the responsibility onto the source Dylan Davies it said nothing about how the show failed to properly vet the story of an admitted liarÂ€Âù Mr. Silverman said in an email. Â€ÂœThere are basic questions left unanswered about how the program checked out what Davies told them and where this process failed.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœIn the short term this will confirm the worst suspicions of people who donÂ€Â™t trust CBS NewsÂ€Âù said Paul Friedman CBSÂ€Â™s executive vice president for news until 2011. Â€ÂœIn the long term a lot will depend on how tough and transparent CBS can be in finding out how this happened Â€Â” especially when there were not the kind of tight deadline pressures that sometimes result in errors.Â€Âù         Ms. Logan has said that a year of reporting informed the Oct. 27 piece which was Mr. DaviesÂ€Â™s first interview. Some of Ms. LoganÂ€Â™s conclusions still hold up to scrutiny Â€Â” for example that Â€Âœcontrary to the White HouseÂ€Â™s public statements which were still being made a full week later itÂ€Â™s now well established that the Americans were attacked by Al Qaeda in a well-planned assault.Â€Âù         But enough doubts have been sown about Mr. DaviesÂ€Â™ account of being an eyewitness that CBS apologized on Friday scrubbed the report from its site (and the Â€Âœ60 MinutesÂ€Âù Twitter feed) and prepared Ms. LoganÂ€Â™s on-camera statement Sunday. (Mr. DaviesÂ€Â™s account included him hitting an Al Qaeda fighter in the face with the butt of a rifle and seeing the dead ambassador J. Christopher Stevens at a hospital.)         Parallels have been drawn between this case and CBSÂ€Â™s  This time conservatives initially trumpeted the Â€Âœ60 MinutesÂ€Âù report: the morning after it was broadcast Senator Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina said on Fox News that he planned to block all administration nominations until Congress was granted access to all of the survivors of the attack. (On Sunday Mr. Graham stood by his threat despite CBSÂ€Â™s retraction.) At the same time questions about Mr. Davies and his account were immediately raised by both liberal activists and independent reporters.        81,1E+14,0,Article,Letter,"Good Old Books, on Paper",Opinion,151,5.241,6.256, Re Â€Âœ I have concluded that what the digital re-inventors of the book need most of all is a sense of their own absurdity.

The overuse of harsh discipline has become an important education reform issue in California where schools issued more than 700000 suspensions last year. Research has shown that suspending more students doesnÂ€Â™t lead to safer schools or higher test scores.         Instead it accelerates the path to dropout and a lifetime of serious trouble with the law. Judges educators and others are now seeing that the school-to-prison pipeline may well begin with that first school suspension.         As a pediatrician and head of CaliforniaÂ€Â™s largest health foundation I see misbehavior as a warning sign of something going wrong in the life of a child.         Research tells us that the symptoms of young people struggling with social-emotional issues show up in two ways. Some withdraw while others act out. We would be wiser to hold children accountable in ways that include offering them support instead of just suspending them from school.         Too often children come to school troubled by things happening in their homes or communities and the responsibility for addressing these issues shouldnÂ€Â™t fall only on teachers. We need community-school partnerships and more caring adults at schools especially counselors and mental health professionals to give children and educators the best chance to succeed.         ROBERT K. ROSS  All principals should have zero tolerance for a host of disciplinary infractions like bullying bringing drugs or weapons to school fighting cheating and truancy. Educators must use their professional talents to change the behavior of these most challenging students. ThatÂ€Â™s why schools have counselors psychologists and social workers on staff.         The schools in the article used zero tolerance as a means to terminate difficult students rather than trying to explore ways to improve their behavior. Being strict does not mean that educators should forgo their responsibility to educate all children.         ItÂ€Â™s easy to love the conforming child but educators earn accolades for saving the futures of problematic students and potential dropouts.         ROBERT RICKEN    FloridaÂ€Â™s adoption of school discipline policies that shed a Â€Âœtough on crimeÂ€Âù mentality for a Â€Âœsmart on crimeÂ€Âù approach is welcome news and the latest example of needed juvenile justice reform in the United States.         Today advocates law enforcement and policy makers are working together to support and carry out alternatives to one-size-fits-all discipline. The nationwide decline in youth incarceration Â€Â” nearly 40 percent since peaking in 2000 Â€Â” is just one example of how weÂ€Â™re making a comeback for our children.         This turnaround has been driven largely by reforms like the ones in Florida where schools no longer rely on the justice system to address discipline issues and disallow incarceration for minor offenses.         These reforms allow teenagers to learn from their mistakes while not limiting their future potential to get an education a good job or join the military. With proven models for reform in place the sky is the limit for our country and our children.         SARAH BRYER  Â€ÂœZero toleranceÂ€Âù must be replaced with something. A simple school time-capsule project started in Dallas in 2005 is providing that replacement.         Beginning in sixth grade students write periodic letters to themselves about their plans and dreams for the future. They do it in response to letters from their parents and others who write about their dreams for these students. The letters go into a self-addressed envelope that goes into a 500-pound vault in the school lobby: the time capsule.         Every day students pass the vault. Occasionally they may think of their letters inside and what they say.         Letters are rewritten with final letters left for a 10-year class reunion. Students know that at their reunions they will be invited to make their own recommendations to current students about what they would do differently if they were 13 again.         In the last nine years graduation rates have doubled discipline issues have been cut in half and pregnancy rates cut to less than half. That is the power of a constant focus on the future.

He was struck near the right eye by a puck in a game against Philadelphia at Madison Square Garden on March 5. He missed the final 27 regular-season games and played in one playoff game.         The previous season Staal sustained a concussion in a collision with his brother Eric during a game against the Carolina Hurricanes in Raleigh N.C. He was limited to 46 regular-season games though he did play 20 playoff games that spring.         Vigneault said Michael Del Zotto a healthy scratch seven times this season would replace Staal in the lineup. He also said center Dominic Moore would be a healthy scratch in favor of left wing Benoit Pouliot who had been scratched against the Devils.        63,1E+14,1,Article,Obituary (Obit),"Nelson Mandela, South Africaâ€™s Liberator as Prisoner and President, Dies at 95",World,642,5.771,5.358, The South African president Jacob Zuma announced Mr. MandelaÂ€Â™s death.         Mr. Mandela had long said he wanted a quiet exit but the time he spent in a Pretoria hospital this summer was a clamor of quarreling family hungry news media spotlight-seeking politicians and a national outpouring of affection and loss. The vigil eclipsed a visit by President Obama who paid homage to Mr. Mandela but decided not to intrude on the privacy of a dying man he considered his hero.         Mr. Mandela ultimately died at home at 8:50 p.m. local time and he will be buried according to his wishes in the village of Qunu where he grew up. The exhumed remains of three of his children were reinterred there in early July under a court order resolving a family squabble that had played out in the news media.         Mr. MandelaÂ€Â™s quest for freedom took him from the court of tribal royalty to the liberation underground to a prison rock quarry to the presidential suite of AfricaÂ€Â™s richest country. And then when his first term of office was up unlike so many of the successful revolutionaries he regarded as kindred spirits he declined a second term and cheerfully handed over power to an elected successor the country still gnawed by crime poverty corruption and disease but a democracy respected in the world and remarkably at peace.         The question most often asked about Mr. Mandela was how after whites had systematically humiliated his people tortured and murdered many of his friends and cast him into prison for 27 years he could be so evidently free of spite.         The government he formed when he finally won the chance was an improbable fusion of races and beliefs including many of his former oppressors. When he became president he invited one of his white wardens to the  And as president from 1994 to 1999 he devoted much energy to moderating the bitterness of his black electorate and to reassuring whites with fears of vengeance.         The explanation for his absence of rancor at least in part is that Mr. Mandela was that rarity among revolutionaries and moral dissidents: a capable statesman comfortable with compromise and impatient with the doctrinaire.         When the question was put to Mr. Mandela in an interview for this obituary in 2007 Â€Â” after such barbarous torment how do you keep hatred in check? Â€Â” his answer was almost dismissive: Hating clouds the mind. It gets in the way of strategy. Leaders cannot afford to hate.         Except for a youthful flirtation with black nationalism he seemed to have genuinely transcended the racial passions that tore at his country. Some who worked with him said this apparent magnanimity came easily to him because he always regarded himself as superior to his persecutors.         In his five years as president Mr. Mandela though still a sainted figure abroad lost some luster at home as he strained to hold together a divided populace and to turn a fractious liberation movement into a credible government.         Some blacks Â€Â” including Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Mr. MandelaÂ€Â™s former wife who cultivated a following among the most disaffected blacks Â€Â” complained that he had moved too slowly to narrow the vast gulf between the impoverished black majority and the more prosperous white minority. Some whites said he had failed to control crime corruption and cronyism. Some blacks deserted government to make money; some whites emigrated taking capital and knowledge with them.         Undoubtedly Mr. Mandela had become less attentive to the details of governing turning over the daily responsibilities to the deputy who would succeed him in 1999 Thabo Mbeki.         But few among his countrymen doubted that without his patriarchal authority and political shrewdness South Africa might well have descended into civil war long before it reached its imperfect state of democracy.         After leaving the presidency Mr. Mandela brought that moral stature to bear elsewhere around the continent as a peace broker and champion of greater outside investment.         84,1E+14,0,Article,Letter,"More Medicaid Patients, but Not Enough Doctors",Opinion,265,6.545,5.632, You accurately report that newly enrolled patients in Medicaid under Obamacare will have difficulty with access to care (Â€Âœ However the situation is different for specialists compared with primary care physicians.         California has an adequate supply of specialists but they are concentrated in affluent urban communities. If the reimbursement rates are high enough they will be available.         For primary care physicians there is an absolute shortage as 42 of CaliforniaÂ€Â™s 58 counties lack the minimum number.         Hispanics in California will be disproportionately affected. Although they account for 37 percent of the stateÂ€Â™s 38 million people they represent 59 percent of the stateÂ€Â™s 7.2 million uninsured.         Because of high rates of poverty limited English proficiency and the shortage of primary care doctors millions of Hispanics will still face geographic linguistic and cultural barriers to care even with Medicaid.         PATRICK T. DOWLING    The flood of people signing up for Medicaid and the expanding role of Â€Âœin-network only coverageÂ€Âù under the Affordable Care Act requires some initiative to increase the number of doctors in general and the number willing to accept Medicaid and to participate in networks.

Prater eclipsed the record of 63 yards first set 43 years ago by Tom Dempsey of the Saints. The kick came as time expired in the first half to bring the Broncos within 21-20 at intermission.         Equalling Dempsey's booming kick of 1970 were Denver's Jason Elam in 1998 Oakland's Sabastian Janikowski in 2011 and San Francisco's David Akers last season.         The long field goals by Prater Elam and Janikowski all occurred in mile-high Denver where the thin air gives kickers an advantage.         Prater has enjoyed a stellar season converting 17 of 18 field-goal attempts and leads the league with 61 extra points for the Broncos who clinched an AFC playoff berth as they improved their record to 11-2.

The pod of 51 short-finned pilot whales were first observed stranded on the edge of the Florida Everglades National Park on Tuesday. Despite frantic rescue efforts by scientists ten of the whales died on Wednesday and another on Thursday.         With the 11 whales found dead on Sunday about six miles north of Sugar Loaf Key a total of 22 have been confirmed dead the U.S. Coast Guard said in a written statement.         The Coast Guard said 29 whales remained missing having last been seen alive on Friday.         ""Given our knowledge of past mass pilot whales strandings the outlook for finding the remaining whales alive is bleak"" the Coast Guard said adding that other whales may have already died and their bodies sunk under water.         Experts have so far not offered an explanation for why the whales were beaching themselves and dying in the Florida Keys.         Scientists were expected to take samples from the 11 whales found on Sunday to determine a cause of death including possible biotoxins or ""red tide.""         The Coast Guard said there was no evidence of sonar trauma but that it had made inquiries with the U.S. Navy.         The dead whales have included both males and females and have had empty stomachs suggested their health may have been compromised prior to the beaching.         Scientists have performed necropsies on the first 11 deceased whales to look for possible diseases and pathogens as well as environmental and human causes but results may not be available for at least several weeks the Coast Guard said.         Pilot whales are social living in pods of 20 to 90 and typically will not leave ailing or dead members behind. They are a deep-water species that forages on squid octopus and fish and cannot live long in shallow water.

Thompson said Sunday.         The appointee Mark E. Feldman has worked in the district attorneysÂ€Â™ offices in Brooklyn Manhattan and Queens and is now the deputy inspector general at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.         The selection of Mr. Feldman as his chief assistant is Mr. ThompsonÂ€Â™s first major personnel announcement as he begins to reshape the Brooklyn prosecutorÂ€Â™s office which has been shaken in recent months by a review of dozens of homicide convictions. Mr. Thompson a former assistant United States attorney was elected in November in a landslide victory over the longtime incumbent Charles J. Hynes. Mr. Feldman who was a supervisor at the United States attorneyÂ€Â™s office when Mr. Thompson worked there joined the transition team and now is rejoining the Brooklyn district attorneyÂ€Â™s office.         Â€ÂœHe is above reproachÂ€Âù Mr. Thompson said. Â€ÂœHe is going to be a great asset in the new era thatÂ€Â™s coming to the Brooklyn D.A.Â€Â™s office.Â€Âù         Mr. Feldman is expected to play an important role in one of the most difficult investigations Mr. Thompson will inherit: the review of dozens of homicide convictions investigated by a single detective Louis Scarcella a review that Mr. Thompson has criticized repeatedly.         Mr. Scarcella a retired Brooklyn North homicide detective was accused this year of cutting corners in a 1990 homicide investigation. A man who was convicted in the case and served 23 years in prison was released in March after prosecutors told a judge they could no longer stand behind the conviction. When The New York Times detailed more troubling patterns in the detectiveÂ€Â™s work including that he used the same crack-addicted witness in several cases Mr. Hynes reopened all of the investigatorÂ€Â™s trial convictions.         But the inquiry was criticized because Mr. Hynes who was up for his seventh term in office chose to conduct the investigation internally and refused to disclose the names of the cases that were reopened. He also appointed an independent review panel but included some close friends and campaign donors.         Mr. Thompson is expected to disband the panel. He said he planned to enhance the officeÂ€Â™s Conviction Integrity Unit by adding more prosecutors investigators and paralegals.         Â€ÂœI am going to get to the bottom of those casesÂ€Âù Mr. Thompson said. Â€ÂœIt will be a truly independent review. Mark is obviously going to be important in terms of what we ultimately decide to do.Â€Âù         This will not be Mr. FeldmanÂ€Â™s first time as a Brooklyn prosecutor: he was an assistant district attorney there after graduating from Brooklyn Law School in 1976 working under both Eugene Gold and Elizabeth Holtzman. He left a month after Mr. Hynes took office in 1990.         Mr. Feldman later worked in both Queens and Manhattan and then spent 11 years at the United States attorneyÂ€Â™s office in Brooklyn where he was chief of the organized crime unit. During his tenure the bosses of all five of New YorkÂ€Â™s crime families were prosecuted.         He supervised the investigation into the Bonanno family which included testimony from high-ranking members of the syndicate. His multiagency probe of the Gambino familyÂ€Â™s control of the New York waterfront led to the conviction of the crime boss Peter Gotti.         In a statement Mr. Feldman said he and his new boss Â€Âœshare the goal of restoring trust in the district attorneyÂ€Â™s office promoting equal justice and keeping the people of Brooklyn safe.Â€Âù        116,EaqwB2KfCfzAwyHGl7yOYQ,1,Blogs,Blog Post,The Insanity of Our Food Policy,Opinion,10209,,,"A m e r i c a n   f o o d   p o l i c y   h a s   l o n g   b e e n   r i f e   w i t h   h e a d - s c r a t c h i n g   i l l o g i c .

It is also traditionally a time to reflect on the plight of those less fortunate than oneself Â€Â” for example the person on the other side of that cash register.         The last few decades have been tough for many American workers but especially hard on those employed in retail trade Â€Â” a category that includes both the sales clerks at your local Walmart and the staff at your local McDonaldÂ€Â™s. Despite the lingering effects of the financial crisis America is a much richer country than it was 40 years ago. But the inflation-adjusted wages of nonsupervisory workers in retail trade Â€Â” who werenÂ€Â™t particularly well paid to begin with Â€Â”  So can anything be done to  And we can raise the minimum wage.         First a few facts. Although the national minimum wage was raised a few years ago itÂ€Â™s still  Still even if international competition isnÂ€Â™t an issue can we really help workers simply by legislating a higher wage? DoesnÂ€Â™t that violate the law of supply and demand? WonÂ€Â™t the market gods smite us with their invisible hand? The answer is that we have ItÂ€Â™s important to understand how good this evidence is. Normally economic analysis is handicapped by the absence of controlled experiments. For example we can look at what happened to the U.S. economy after the Obama stimulus went into effect but we canÂ€Â™t observe an alternative universe in which there was no stimulus and compare the results.         When it comes to the minimum wage however we have a number of cases in which a state raised its own minimum wage while a neighboring state did not. If there were anything to the notion that minimum wage increases have big negative effects on employment that result should show up in state-to-state comparisons. It doesnÂ€Â™t.         So a minimum-wage increase would help low-paid workers with few adverse side effects. And weÂ€Â™re talking about a lot of people. Early this year the Economic Policy Institute estimated that an increase in the national minimum wage to $10.10 from its current $7.25 would benefit 30 million workers. Most would benefit directly because they are currently earning less than $10.10 an hour but others would benefit indirectly because their pay is in effect pegged to the minimum Â€Â” for example fast-food store managers who are paid slightly (but only slightly) more than the workers they manage.         Now many economists have a visceral dislike of anything that sounds like price-fixing even if the evidence strongly indicates that it would have positive effects. Some of these skeptics oppose doing anything to help low-wage workers. Others argue that we should subsidize not regulate Â€Â” in particular that we should expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (E.I.T.C.) an existing program that does indeed provide significant aid to low-income working families. And for the record IÂ€Â™m all for an expanded E.I.T.C.         But there are it turns out good technical reasons to regard the minimum wage and the E.I.T.C. as  An increase in the minimum wage on the other hand just might happen thanks to overwhelming public support. This support doesnÂ€Â™t come just from Democrats or even independents; strong majorities of Republicans (57 percent) and self-identified conservatives (59 percent) favor an increase.         In short raising the minimum wage would help many Americans and might actually be politically possible.

Â€ÂœIt was not confrontational.Â€Âù         That has not always been the case in recent years as Iranian fast-attack boats have harassed American warships and in recent months as the government in Tehran has deployed remotely piloted aircraft that carry surveillance pods and that someday may carry rockets.         There are multiple political bases of power in  The navy of the Revolutionary Guards consists of fast-attack speedboats with high-powered machine guns and torpedoes and crews that in the past employed guerrilla tactics including swarming perilously close to American warships.         Iran has scaled back its most belligerent naval activities in recent years and senior Navy officials said they saw no major shifts after the nuclear deal. Â€ÂœWe havenÂ€Â™t detected any notable change in their behaviorÂ€Âù said Vice Adm. John W. Miller commander of the NavyÂ€Â™s Fifth Fleet which has its longtime headquarters in Bahrain directly across the water from Iran.         That said the United States is taking no chances. Defense Secretary  Last year the Pentagon moved significant military reinforcements into the Gulf to deter the Iranian military from any possible attempt to shut the  As part of that longer-term effort the number of coastal patrol ships based in Bahrain to conduct maritime security missions is set to double to 10 ships by next spring from five vessels two years ago. Six Coast Guard vessels perform similar duties. Ship crews are now assigned one- and two-year tours instead of rotating every six months.         That change increases cohesion among crew members improves their understanding about operating in the complex Gulf environment and Navy officials say also lessens the chance of a miscalculation that could lead to unintended hostilities.         The patrol ships are among the NavyÂ€Â™s smallest. Six of the 179-foot Whirlwinds placed end to end would still come up shorter than one of the behemoth American aircraft carriers that also ply the Gulf waters.         But they are about the same size as the ships used by many of the Gulf states like Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates and thus they have developed an unusual kinship with their maritime brethren in the region.         Â€ÂœThese ships are less intimidating to the local naviesÂ€Âù said Cmdr. John Howard 44 who oversees the eight patrol vessels now stationed in Bahrain. Â€ÂœTheyÂ€Â™re more like their own ships and so they can relate to these ships better.Â€Âù         The WhirlwindÂ€Â™s crew of 24 sailors and four officers is a tight-knit group and small enough that everyone is trained in more than one job.

The disease is rare but it can be fatal and its incidence is increasing especially among men and women infected with H.I.V. Like cervical cancer anal cancer is usually caused by the human papillomavirus or HPV which is sexually transmitted.Ã‚Â          Though most of her patients are women Dr. Stier who works at Boston Medical Center also treated about 110 men last year using techniques adapted from those developed to screen women for cervical cancer. Ã‚Â          But in September the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology insisted that its members treat only women with few exceptions and identified the procedure in which Dr. Stier has expertise as one that gynecologists are not allowed to perform on men. Doctors cannot ignore such directives from a specialty board because most need certification to keep their jobs.         Now Dr. StierÂ€Â™s studies are in limbo her research colleagues are irate and her male patients are distraught.Ã‚Â Other gynecologists who had translated their skills to help male patients are in similar straits.         And researchers about to start a major clinical trial that is aimed at preventing anal cancer with $5.6 million from the federal government say the boardÂ€Â™s decision will keep some of the best qualified most highly skilled doctors in the United States from treating male patients in the study. The director of the planned study and Dr. Stier have asked the gynecology board to reconsider its position.         But the board based in Dallas has not budged.         Â€ÂœWe havenÂ€Â™t heard of any compelling reason to change anythingÂ€Âù said Dr. Kenneth L. Noller the boardÂ€Â™s director of evaluation. He said there were plenty of other doctors available to provide the HPV-related procedures that some gynecologists had been performing on men.         Dr. Larry C. Gilstrap the groupÂ€Â™s executive director said the specialty of obstetrics and gynecology was specifically designed to treat problems of the female reproductive tract and was Â€Âœrestricted to taking care of women.Â€Âù Of the 24 medical specialties recognized in the United States he said it is the only one that is gender-specific and it has been that way since 1935.         Dr. Stier said that she like many other doctors had not understood the definition of their field to be quite so absolute.         The board had always regarded the treatment of women as its mission Dr. Gilstrap said but felt a particular need to emphasize it now because the specialtyÂ€Â™s image was being tarnished by members who had strayed into moneymaking sidelines like testosterone therapy for men and liposuction and other cosmetic procedures for both women and men.         Dr. Mark H. Einstein a gynecologic oncologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx said Â€ÂœThe boardÂ€Â™s approach is to be rather dogmatic and to draw a line in the sand.Â€Âù         On Sept. 12 the board posted on its website a stringent and newly explicit definition of obstetrician-gynecologists limiting the proportion of time they could spend on nongynecologic procedures and noting that with few exceptions members must not treat men. The notice specifically prohibited gynecologists from performing an examination called anoscopy on men.         Anoscopy involves using a tube and a light to examine the anal canal which is about 1.5 inches long. The procedure is the same in men and women. A Â€Âœhigh-resolutionÂ€Âù version adds a magnifier to look for abnormal growths that may be cancers or precancers. Cancers usually require surgery but doctors can burn off precancers in hopes of preventing cancer.         A similar approach led to a tremendous decline in cervical cancer in the United States and doctors hope to accomplish the same for anal cancer. About 7000 new cases of anal cancer and 880 deaths are expected in 2013 in the United States; the incidence has been increasing by 2.2 percent a year for the last 10 years.        170,1E+14,0,Article,News,Australia v England-Second Ashes Test Scoreboard,Sports,170,5.712,5.716,ADELAIDE Â€Â” Scoreboard after Australia beat England by 218 runs to win the second Ashes test at Adelaide Oval on the fifth day on Monday.

England's final four wickets fell within an hour's play on the fifth day at Adelaide Oval the 218-run defeat completed in cold and gloomy conditions and leaving the tourists 2-0 down in the five-test series ahead of their most challenging match in Perth.         Few pundits are likely to give England any chance of winning at the WACA where they haven't beaten Australia in a test since 1978.         As holders England need only level the series 2-2 to retain the Ashes but Cook has only three full days to repair his team's battered self-belief after they were comprehensively outpointed in all aspects of the game in both Brisbane and Adelaide.         As in Brisbane England's batsmen were the most culpable their first innings 172 in response to Australia's 570-9 declared leaving their bowlers on a hiding to nothing.         Despite their task England's bowlers failed to extract anywhere near the same venom from Adelaide Oval's drop-in wicket as the hosts while the tourists' fielding was often abysmal with dropped catches ultimately costing hundreds of runs.         ""In this game on a good first inning wicket we created some chances and we didn't take those chances"" Cook told reporters.         ""I think Australia have been very clinical in taking every chance that has come to them. We let them off the hook and they punished us very heavily to get to 570.         ""And quite clearly getting bowled out for 170 wasn't good enough. And there was some poor shots in there as well.         ""We can't sit there moping around about it. It's hurting us like hell but we're the only guys who can change it.         ""Self-belief is certainly an issue you've got to make sure you look after when you've lost heavily in two games. But if we don't believe it then no one else is going to.         ""We've got to look right deep into our souls into our hearts and turn it around.""         TOUGH MOMENTS         Cook conceded that berating his team mates for their hazardous shot selections would be hard with his own form in the doldrums.         After scores of 13 and 65 in Brisbane Cook was bowled for three by a searing delivery from Mitchell Johnson in the first innings.         The manner of his second innings dismissal however holing out for one when trying to hook the same bowler when his team desperately needed a captain's knock has raised questions about his mental state and susceptibility to extreme pace.         Cook was Australia's chief tormentor in the 2010-11 Ashes series under captain Andrew Strauss scoring 766 runs in his seven innings to help set up England's first win Down Under in a quarter of a century.         But his form has waned as captain against Australia and he managed only a top score of 62 in his team's 3-0 triumph in the Ashes series at home earlier this year.         ""I need to score more runs simple deal"" he said.         ""We all do but there's only so many times you can keep telling the lads to do it and if you're not delivering it makes it harder.         ""I'm there at the top of the order as a batter. These last two games I haven't been scoring enough runs. I need to go and change that.         ""There are some very tough moments as a captain and we're in the middle of it.""

In this special issue of Science Times NATALIE ANGIER takes stock of our changing definition of family. CHELSEA MICH. Â€Â” Kristi and Michael Burns have a lot in common. They love crossword puzzles football going to museums and reading five or six books at a time. They describe themselves as mild-mannered introverts who suffer from an array of chronic medical problems. The two share similar marital rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ©s too. On their wedding day in 2011 the groom was 43 years old and the bride 39 yet it was marriage No. 3 for both.         Today their blended family is a sprawling sometimes uneasy ensemble of two sharp-eyed sons from her two previous husbands a daughter and son from his second marriage ex-spouses of varying degrees of involvement the partners of ex-spouses the bemused in-laws and a kitten named Agnes that likes to sleep on computer keyboards.         If the Burnses seem atypical as an American nuclear family how about the Schulte-Waysers a merry band of two married dads six kids and two dogs? Or the Indrakrishnans a successful immigrant couple in Atlanta whose teenage daughter divides her time between prosaic homework and the precision footwork of ancient Hindu dance; the Glusacs of Los Angeles with their two nearly grown children and their litany of middle-class challenges that seem like minor sagas; Ana Perez and Julian Hill of Harlem unmarried and just getting by but with Warren Buffett-size dreams for their three young children; and the alarming number of families with incarcerated parents a sorry byproduct of AmericaÂ€Â™s status as the  The typical American family if it ever lived anywhere but on  Researchers who study the structure and evolution of the American family express unsullied astonishment at how rapidly the family has changed in recent years the transformations often exceeding or capsizing those same expertsÂ€Â™ predictions of just a few journal articles ago.         Â€ÂœThis churning this turnover in our intimate partnerships is creating complex families on a scale weÂ€Â™ve not seen beforeÂ€Âù said  Yet for all the restless shape-shifting of the American family researchers who comb through census survey and historical data and conduct field studies of ordinary home life have identified a number of key emerging themes.         Families they say are becoming more socially egalitarian over all even as economic disparities widen. Families are more ethnically racially religiously and stylistically diverse than half a generation ago Â€Â” than even half a year ago.         In increasing numbers blacks marry whites atheists marry Baptists men marry men and women women Democrats marry Republicans and start talk shows. Good friends join forces as part of the Â€Âœvoluntary kinÂ€Âù movement sharing medical directives wills even adopting one another legally.         Single people live alone and proudly consider themselves families of one Â€Â” more generous and civic-minded than so-called Â€Âœgreedy marrieds.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœThere are really good studies showing that single people are more likely than married couples to be in touch with friends neighbors siblings and parentsÂ€Âù said  But that doesnÂ€Â™t mean theyÂ€Â™ll be single forever. Â€ÂœThere are not just more types of families and living arrangements than there used to beÂ€Âù said  At the same time the old-fashioned family plan of stably married parents residing with their children remains a source of considerable power in America Â€Â” but one that is increasingly seen as out of reach to all but the educated elite.         Â€ÂœWeÂ€Â™re seeing a class divide not only between the haves and the have-nots but between the I doÂ€Â™s and the I do notsÂ€Âù Dr. Coontz said. Those who are enjoying the perks of a good marriage Â€ÂœwouldnÂ€Â™t stand for any other kindÂ€Âù she said while those who would benefit most from marital stability Â€Âœare the ones least likely to have the resources to sustain it.Â€Âù         Yet across the divide runs a white picket fence our unshakable star-spangled belief in the value of marriage and family. We marry divorce and remarry at rates not seen anywhere else in the developed world. We lavish  WeÂ€Â™re sappy family romantics. When an informal sample of 52 Americans of different ages professions and hometowns were asked the first thought that came to mind on hearing the word Â€ÂœfamilyÂ€Âù the answers varied hardly at all. Love! Kids! Mom! Dinner!         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s the backbone of how we liveÂ€Âù said David Anderson 52 an insurance claims adjuster from Chicago. Â€ÂœIt means everythingÂ€Âù said Linda McAdam 28 who is in human resources on Long Island.         Yes everything and sometimes too many things. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s almost like a weightÂ€Âù said Rob Fee 26 a financial analyst in San Francisco Â€Âœa heavy weight.Â€Âù Or as the comedian George Burns said Â€ÂœHappiness is having a large loving caring close-knit family in another city.Â€Âù         In charting the differences between todayÂ€Â™s families and those of the past demographers start with the kids Â€Â” or rather the lack of them.         The nationÂ€Â™s birthrate today is  One big reason is the soaring cost of ushering offspring to functional independence. According to the Department of Agriculture the average middle-class couple will spend  As steep as the fertility decline has been the marriage rate has fallen more sharply particularly among young women who do most of the nationÂ€Â™s childbearing. As a result 41 percent of babies are now born out of wedlock a fourfold increase since 1970.         The trend is not demographically uniform instead tracking the nationÂ€Â™s widening gap in income and opportunity. Among women with a bachelorÂ€Â™s degrees or higher 90 percent adhere to the old playground song and put marriage before a baby carriage. For everybody else maternity is often decoupled from matrimony: 40 percent of women with some college but no degree and 57 percent of women with high school diplomas or less are unmarried when they give birth to their first child.         More than one-quarter of these unwed mothers are living with a partner who may or may not be their childÂ€Â™s biological father. The rise of the cohabiting couple is another striking feature of the evolving American family: From 1996 to 2012 the number jumped almost 170 percent to 7.8 million from 2.9 million.         Nor are unmarried mothers typically in their teens; contrary to all the talk of an epidemic of teenage motherhood the birthrate among adolescent girls has dropped by nearly half since 1991 and last year hit an all-time low a public health triumph that experts attribute to better sex education and birth-control methods. Most unmarried mothers today demographers say are in their 20s and early 30s.         Also dÃƒÂ©modÃƒÂ© is the old debate over whether mothers of dependent children should work outside the home. The facts have voted the issue is settled and Paycheck Mommy is now a central organizing principle of the modern American family.         The share of mothers employed full or part time has quadrupled since the 1950s and today accounts for nearly three-quarters of women with children at home. The number of women who are their familiesÂ€Â™ sole or primary breadwinner also has soared to 40 percent today from 11 percent in 1960.         Â€ÂœYes I wear the pants in the familyÂ€Âù said Ana Perez 35 a mother of three and a vice president at a financial services company in New York who was indeed wearing pants. Â€ÂœI can say it brings me joy to know I can take care of my family.Â€Âù         Cultural attitudes are adapting accordingly. Sixty-two percent of the public and 72 percent of adults under 30  Mothers are bringing home more of the bacon and of the mortarboards too. While most couples are an even match scholastically 28 percent of married women are better educated than their mates; that is true of just 19 percent of married men. Forty years ago the asymmetry went the other way.         Some experts argue that the growing legion of mothers with advanced degrees has helped sharpen the already brutal competition for admission to the nationÂ€Â™s elite universities which stress the importance of extracurricular activities. Nothing predicts the breadth and busyness of a childÂ€Â™s after-school schedule better it turns out than the motherÂ€Â™s level of education.         One change that caught many family researchers by surprise was the recent dip in the divorce rate. After many decades of upward march followed by a long stubborn stay at the familiar 50 percent mark that made every nuptial feel like a coin flip the rate began falling in 1996 and is now just above 40 percent for first-time marriages.         The decline has been even more striking among middle- and upper-middle-income couples with college degrees. For them fewer than one in three marriages is expected to end in divorce a degree of stability that allows elite couples to merge their resources with confidence maximally invest in their children and otherwise widen the gap between themselves and the struggling masses.         There are exceptions of course. Among baby boomers the rate of marriage failure has surged 50 percent in the past 20 years Â€Â” perhaps out of an irritable nostalgia researchers said for the days of free love better love anything but this love. Nor do divorce rates appear to have fallen among those who take the old Samuel Johnson quip as a prescription allowing hope to triumph over experience and marrying again and again.         For both Mike and Kristi Burns now in their 40s the first marriage came young and left early and the second stuck around for more than a dozen years.         Kristi was 19 living in South Carolina and her Marine boyfriend was about to be shipped to Japan. Â€ÂœI wasnÂ€Â™t attached to him reallyÂ€Âù she said Â€Âœbut for some reason I felt this might be my only chance at marriage.Â€Âù         In Japan Kristi gave birth to her son Brandon realized she was lonely and miserable and left the marriage seven weeks after their first anniversary. Back in the States Kristi studied to be a travel agent moved to Michigan and married her second husband at age 23.         He was an electrician. He adopted Brandon and the couple had a son Griffin. The marriage lasted 13 years.         Â€ÂœWe were really great friends but we werenÂ€Â™t a great husband and wifeÂ€Âù Kristi said. Â€ÂœOur parenting styles were too different.Â€Âù         Besides she went on Â€Âœhe didnÂ€Â™t verbalize a lot but he was mad a lot and I was tired of walking around on eggshells.Â€Âù         After the divorce friends persuaded her to try the online dating service  Â€ÂœKristi was one of the first people to ping meÂ€Âù said Mike Burns an engineer for an e-commerce company. Â€ÂœThis was at 3 in the morning.Â€Âù         They started chatting. Mike told Kristi how heÂ€Â™d married his first wife while he was still in college Â€Â” Â€Âœdefinitely too youngÂ€Âù he said Â€Â” and divorced her two years later. He met his second wife through mutual friends they had a big church wedding started a software publishing company together sold it and had two children Brianna and Alec.         When the marriage started going downhill Mike ignored signs of trouble like the comments from neighbors who noticed his wife was never around on weekends.         Â€ÂœI was delusional I was depressedÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœI still had the attitude that divorce wasnÂ€Â™t something you did.Â€Âù         After 15 years of marriage his wife did it for him and kicked him out of the house. His divorce papers hadnÂ€Â™t yet been finalized he told Kristi that first chat night. IÂ€Â™ll help you get through it she replied.         Mike and Kristi admit their own three-year-old marriage isnÂ€Â™t perfect. The kids are still adjusting to one another. Sometimes Kristi a homemaker feels jealous of how much attention her husband showers on his daughter Brianna 13. Sometimes Mike retreats into his computer. Yet they are determined to stay together.         Â€ÂœI know everyone thinks this marriage is a joke and people expect it to failÂ€Âù said Kristi . Â€ÂœBut that just makes me work harder at it.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™d say our chances of success are better than averageÂ€Âù her husband added.         In America family is at once about home and the next great frontier.         LOS ANGELES Â€Â” The Schulte-Wayser family is like the Jetsons: a blend of midcentury traditional and postmodern cool.         One parent is the breadwinner a corporate lawyer who is Type A when it comes to schoolwork bedtime and the importance of rules. The other parent is the self-described Â€Âœbaby whispererÂ€Âù staying home to care for the coupleÂ€Â™s two daughters and four sons who dash through their days as if wearing jetpacks.         Both parents know when rules and roles are made for subverting. Â€ÂœWe are each of us very maternal in our own wayÂ€Âù said Joshua Wayser 50 the lawyer. Â€ÂœI take my girls shopping and IÂ€Â™m in charge of beauty and hair care.Â€Âù Mr. Wayser glanced at Richard Schulte 61 his homemaker-artist husband who was sitting nearby.         Â€ÂœOf courseÂ€Âù Mr. Wayser added dryly Â€Âœhe doesnÂ€Â™t think I do a good job.Â€Âù         Mr. Wayser Mr. Schulte and their six adopted children are part of one of the more emphatic reinventions of the standard family flow chart. A growing number of gay men and lesbians are pursuing parenthood any way they can: adoption surrogacy donor sperm.         Â€ÂœThereÂ€Â™s a gayby boom thatÂ€Â™s for sureÂ€Âù Mr. Wayser said. Â€ÂœSo many of our friends are having kids.Â€Âù         Some critics have expressed concern that the children of gay parents may suffer from social stigma and the lack of conventional adult role models or that same-sex couples are not suited to the monotonous rigors of family life. Earlier studies often invoked in the culture wars over same-sex marriage suggested that children who lived with gay parents were prone to lower grades conduct disorders and a heightened risk of drug and alcohol problems.         But new research suggests that such fears are misplaced. Through a preliminary analysis of census data and other sources  Once these factors are taken into account said Dr. Rosenfeld author of  And two-father couples in defiance of stereotype turn out to be exemplars of domesticity.

Many of the children of lesbian couples are the biological offspring of one of the women and a semen donor Â€Â” who may be anonymous a friend the brother of the nongestating woman or  The Schulte-Wayser family started out unhyphenated as the Waysers. The two men had broken up; Mr. Wayser was living alone in Los Angeles his law career was in flux and he was tired of obsessing about work. Â€ÂœI thought Â€Â˜IÂ€Â™ve got to do something elseÂ€Â™Ã‚Â Â€Âù he said. Â€ÂœI had to come out to myself as a father.Â€Âù         His mother was thrilled and she offered to pay the costs for a surrogate mother to carry a baby conceived with his sperm. Mr. Wayser said no.         Â€ÂœI wanted the clarity of having someone who didnÂ€Â™t share my genetics who was completely different from meÂ€Âù he said.         He met with an adoption lawyer in March 2000 and by June he had a newborn daughter Julie. Several months later Mr. Schulte called to chat heard Julie in the background and stopped by to meet her.         The baby reminded him of Don King the boxing promoter. Â€ÂœIt was love at first sightÂ€Âù Mr. Schulte said and Mr. Wayser acknowledged Â€ÂœI used Julie as bait.Â€Âù         His old boyfriend took it. Â€ÂœWe were a couple againÂ€Âù Mr. Schulte said. Or rather he amended Â€Âœwe were a family.Â€Âù He and Mr. Wayser later married in Malibu.         From 2002 to 2009 four brothers and a sister followed Â€Â” Derek A J Isaac (all from one mother) Shayna and Joey. Â€ÂœThatÂ€Â™s my line in the sandÂ€Âù Mr. Wayser said. Â€ÂœWeÂ€Â™ve run out of room.Â€Âù         Yet he believes itÂ€Â™s easier to manage a large family than a small one. Â€ÂœThey entertain each other. They organize themselvesÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœWe send the kids out. We say Â€Â˜Go ride your bike go out and play.Â€Â™ We want them to have a very traditional childhood in a nontraditional setting.Â€Âù         He admits to being a worrier. Some of the children have learning disabilities and require extensive tutoring and he doesnÂ€Â™t know what risks the birth mothers might have taken during pregnancy.         But he resents people who note the color of his childrenÂ€Â™s skin as well as his obvious financial resources and cluck about how noble he is and how lucky the children are.         Â€ÂœNo IÂ€Â™m the one whoÂ€Â™s lucky hereÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m not trying to save the world.Â€Âù         Ana Perez 35 who moved to New York from the Dominican Republic at age 5 has an open smile a firm handshake and a vivid scrappy manner just this side of a fireplug. But as she recalled the night she threw the father of her two older children out of her Harlem apartment her voice cracked into a dozen pieces and her eyes blurred with tears.         She might have accepted his infidelities if heÂ€Â™d kept them discreet cheap and away from the neighborhood. Â€ÂœI had this mentality that men will be men.Â€Âù she said.         But when he began lavishly dating the younger sister of a friend of hers Ms. Perez confronted him in a fury.         Â€ÂœI said Â€Â˜YouÂ€Â™ve been spending money on this person when you have children who need diapers and milk?Â€Â™Ã‚Â Â€Âù she said. Â€ÂœThe last straw was we had this huge fight in the kitchen and I pulled a knife on him. For a second I saw my children without a mother Â€Â” because I would be in jail.Â€Âù         Their relationship ended that night a decade ago she said Â€Âœand I never looked back.Â€Âù         He still visits with George 16 and Bryana 10 Â€Âœas a friend figureÂ€Âù Ms. Perez said but he has no say in their upbringing.         For the past six years Ms. Perez has lived with Julian Hill 39 the father of her third child Bubba 4. Mr. Hill is tall and African-American his head shaved his cream-colored suit impeccably paired with a blue-checked bankerÂ€Â™s shirt and yellow tie. He is devoted to all three children and involved in their everyday lives.         Â€ÂœI come home every nightÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœThey might be asleep when I get home but IÂ€Â™m here every night. IÂ€Â™m always pushing them hard to do their very best maybe sometimes a little too hard.Â€Âù         Until this fall Ms. Perez worked for a financial services firm and she has been the familyÂ€Â™s primary earner. Mr. Hill equally ambitious has worked as a notary public mortgage closer and occasional stock investor. He and Ms. Perez recently started a small notary-mortgage business.         Â€ÂœI think like Warren BuffettÂ€Âù Mr. Hill said. Â€ÂœMy plan is to be a billionaire but if I fall short and end up a millionaire that would be fine.Â€Âù         Yet he admits that for now even that downsized goal remains elusive. Â€ÂœIf youÂ€Â™re talking about incomeÂ€Âù he said Â€ÂœweÂ€Â™re lower lower middle class.Â€Âù         If youÂ€Â™re talking about their relationship status he and Ms. Perez have been engaged for more than a year and they plan to go more than another year before getting married.         Of the many changes to the design packaging and content of family life over the past generation researchers cite two as especially significant.         One is the sharp increase in out-of-wedlock births among all but the most highly educated women. The second is the repositioning of marriage from cornerstone to capstone from a foundational act of early adulthood to a crowning event of later adulthood Â€Â” an event that follows such previous achievements as finishing college starting a career and owning furniture not made from fruit crates.         The two trends are interrelated researchers say but for reasons that are often misunderstood. Unmarried parents are not necessarily the careless and shortsighted hedonists of stereotype. Instead a growing number of Americans are simply intimidated by the whole idea of marriage: It has assumed ever greater cultural status becoming the mark of established winners rather than of modestly optimistic beginners (while weddings have become extravagant pageants where doves and butterflies are released but still nobody gets the bridesmaid dresses right).         Childbearing on the other hand happens naturally and offers what marriage all too often does not: lifelong bonds of love.         Â€ÂœFor many cohabiting couples thereÂ€Â™s a high bar for marriage high expectations of where they should be at economically or emotionally and if they donÂ€Â™t meet that bar theyÂ€Â™ll put off getting marriedÂ€Âù said  Â€ÂœBut if theyÂ€Â™re reasonably pleased with the relationship and happen to find themselves pregnantÂ€Âù she continued Â€Âœthey may realize theyÂ€Â™re not in a great place financially to become parents but theyÂ€Â™re still happy to have the child.Â€Âù They find Â€Âœa sense of purpose and fulfillment in parenthoodÂ€Âù even when the rest of life is withholding the goods.          Â€ÂœIn the middle class the divorce rate has gone down and family life is in many ways simpler than it used to beÂ€Âù she said in an interview. Â€ÂœThereÂ€Â™s far more complexity and churning of households among the poor a turnover of partnerships lots of half-siblings.Â€Âù         Yet Dr. Edin also punctures the myth of the low-income father as a deadbeat who deposits his sperm and runs. Instead the young men in her study were eager to establish their paternity.         Â€ÂœTheyÂ€Â™re showing up at the hospital and signing birth certificates in drovesÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœTheyÂ€Â™re doing all this voluntarily even though they know that by having their name on the certificate theyÂ€Â™ll be liable for child support and could go to jail if they donÂ€Â™t pay.Â€Âù         The fathers also proved to be more involved in their childrenÂ€Â™s lives than previously believed. Â€ÂœEven five years in about two-thirds of fathers are seeing their kids at least monthly and just under half are seeing their kids several times a weekÂ€Âù Dr. Edin said.         Most of Ms. PerezÂ€Â™s previous co-workers were younger than she was and came from middle-class backgrounds and she acknowledges that their timing of life events has its benefits.         Â€ÂœYou go to college you build your finances you marry you build more finances then you have childrenÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœIf you wait longer you have the foundation youÂ€Â™re more educated and you have the confidence in yourself that youÂ€Â™re able to survive.Â€Âù         Then again she laughed Â€Âœin Spanish culture we do everything early.Â€Âù         She is convinced that having her first child at 19 was the right thing to do. Without that incentive Â€ÂœI would have had such a different lifeÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœI would have been much less productive. I would have spent all my time just hanging out.Â€Âù         But between the spur of her familyÂ€Â™s needs and a work ethic she describes as Â€ÂœawesomeÂ€Âù Ms. Perez rose to a vice presidency at her previous company Â€Âœand I didnÂ€Â™t even graduate high schoolÂ€Âù she said.         Nevertheless she frets incessantly about the future. SheÂ€Â™d like to go back to school and set something aside for her childrenÂ€Â™s college educations; she wonÂ€Â™t buy cereal thatÂ€Â™s not on sale; and the last thing she wants to spend money on right now is a wedding.         Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m O.K. just going to City HallÂ€Âù she said.         Mr. Hill wonÂ€Â™t hear of it. Â€ÂœI canÂ€Â™t do that I canÂ€Â™t just go downtownÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœI want to do something big a wedding with friends and family standing together.Â€Âù         So heÂ€Â™ll wait until heÂ€Â™s saved enough to pay for the wedding of his dreams when he can celebrate the family he loves and know it has arrived.         ATLANTA Â€Â” When people first meet Dr. Indran Indrakrishnan a gastroenterologist with a busy private practice near Atlanta they take note of his unusual name his crisply lilting accent his tan complexion and wavy black hair and they ask Â€ÂœSo doctor where are you from?Â€Âù         Â€ÂœSee if you can guessÂ€Âù Dr. Indrakrishnan replies cheerfully. India? No. Pakistan? No. Iran Egypt Turkey Afghanistan? Negatives all around.         Â€ÂœAt that point theyÂ€Â™re stumped and they move on to South AmericaÂ€Âù he said Â€Âœand when I finally tell them I was born in Sri Lanka they look more confused than ever. Â€Â˜Sri Lanka? Where is that?Â€Â™Ã‚Â Â€Âù         Such casual geographic illiteracy may soon give way under the sheer force of numbers. Dr. Indrakrishnan is part of a new tide of immigration that has been sweeping America upending old voting blocs reconfiguring neighborhoods diversifying local restaurant options and casting a fresh perspective on the meaning of traditional family values.         Though much of the immigration debate has focused on Latinos the fastest-growing immigrant groups  The 1950s stereotype of the ideal American family of Dick Jane and Wonder Bread homogeneity arose at a time when the immigration rate was near historic lows. Today the best place to find a traditional G-rated American family may be in an immigrant community. Asian-American families in particular are exceptionally stable.  Many of the new Asian immigrants come from solidly middle-class backgrounds and many though by no means all do as well or better after moving to the United States. Fifty-one percent hold college degrees compared with 31 percent of all adults. According to recent studies Asian-Americans have the highest average household income of any racial group roughly $68000 a year compared with $55000 for whites and $34000 for African-Americans.         At the front edge of the Asian-American boom are immigrants from South Asia including India Pakistan and Sri Lanka.         Dr. Indrakrishnan 53 who also teaches at the Emory University School of Medicine is something of a celebrity among South Asian immigrants Â€Â” the sociable civic-minded and highly successful professional everyone wants to schmooze with at the local Hindu temple each week.         Â€ÂœSometimes I have to go to temple during off hoursÂ€Âù he said Â€Âœor IÂ€Â™ll get caught up chatting there the entire day.Â€Âù         He lives with his wife Gayathri 49 a tax accountant and their daughter Harini a high school senior in a gated enclave on the banks of a glistening artificial lake not far from the former residence of the football quarterback Michael Vick. The house feels like a castle only bigger Â€Â” 15000 square feet of vaulted chandeliered ceilings an enormous alabaster fireplace matching ornate staircases that curve together like an upside-down heart and an elevator if youÂ€Â™re too tired for the stairs.

If it wasnÂ€Â™t exactly love at first sight she said Â€Âœthe chemistry was there.Â€Âù The couple spent a year exchanging phone calls and letters and were married in 1991.         Â€ÂœWe had whatÂ€Â™s called a semi-arranged marriageÂ€Âù Dr. Indrakrishnan said. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s quite common back in India and Sri Lanka.Â€Âù Families are involved but they donÂ€Â™t push; Â€Âœwe had to like each other and get along.Â€Âù         After they married and settled in the United States Ms. Indrakrishnan traded microbiology for an M.B.A. and a numbers-crunching career. She and her husband became American citizens a decade ago.         Â€ÂœI love living here!Â€Âù he said. Â€ÂœIt is truly the land of opportunities.Â€Âù Yet he said he would not have wanted to marry an American woman and when asked the first word that came to mind on hearing the word Â€ÂœfamilyÂ€Âù he said Â€ÂœGayathri my wife.Â€Âù         The Census Bureau does not track the frequency of arranged marriages but researchers believe the numbers are rising. Among other signs they said is the growing number of immigrant matchmaking websites like  And though many Americans may bridle at the idea studies suggest there is little downside to letting the family do your advance work. Kathryn Klement a doctoral candidate in psychology at Northern Illinois University surveyed 329 married Indian women 176 of them in arranged marriages and said Â€ÂœI didnÂ€Â™t find any significant differencesÂ€Âù between the two groups in marital happiness feelings of intimacy trust and commitment sexual satisfaction and the ease with which the women could express their desires.         Indran and Gayathri Indrakrishnan independently identified the same key to long-lasting marital harmony. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s toleranceÂ€Âù she said. Many of Dr. IndrakrishnanÂ€Â™s American patients Â€Âœare not very tolerant of their spousesÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœThey want the chemistry to be perfect and if it isnÂ€Â™t pfft they split up.Â€Âù         Tolerance extends to their parenting style. Their expectations for Harini are quite high but they care less whether she aces every class than that she is always trying always seeking to improve.         Â€ÂœIf there is homework due or a test the next day and sheÂ€Â™s goofing off and not listening to me yes IÂ€Â™ll be upsetÂ€Âù her mother said. Harini it seems has absorbed the parental credo. When she sensed that Facebook was interfering with her schoolwork she deactivated her account.         Also poised for deactivation is a certain clichÃƒÂ© symbolized by fangs and stripes.         It is no secret that many Asian-American students excel academically; their average SAT scores for example are the  One theory to gain traction lately is that Asian-American parents are harsh taskmasters who virtually chain their children to their desks and pianos a view reinforced by Amy Chua in her best-selling book  But a long-term study of 300 Chinese-American families suggests that view is nothing but a stereotype. The researchers led by  Â€ÂœSupportive parenting always yields the best outcome academically and socio-emotionally tooÂ€Âù she added. Â€ÂœThese kids outperform the kids of tiger parents by quite a lot.Â€Âù         She and her colleagues proposed other factors that might help explain the good report cards: family pride; cultural traditions that extol education like  Â€ÂœThey gave up everything for their kidsÂ€Âù as Dr. Kim characterized this attitude Â€Âœso IÂ€Â™d better not blow it.Â€Âù And when they succeed they bring honor to ancestors descendants the entire high-fiving clan.         LOS ANGELES Â€Â” Jan Glusac 51 is blond and heigh-ho friendly a first-grade teacher with a first-rate tolerance for contradictory ideas. A few years ago she and her family participated in a landmark study by researchers from the University of California Los Angeles Â€Â” a close anthropological look at the daily lives of 32 typical middle-class American families.         Does she feel that her family is in fact typical?         Â€ÂœI do and I donÂ€Â™tÂ€Âù Ms. Glusac says.         She wears a long white skirt black blouse jeans jacket and a silver necklace and is sitting on a plump aubergine couch in a comfortable recently renovated postwar bungalow in Westchester a solidly middle-class neighborhood not far from the Los Angeles airport.         On the typical side of the ledger: The average middle-class family has two children and seated next to Ms. Glusac are her two children Katie and Chris.         Katie 17 is a high school senior a star of her cross-country and soccer teams an intern at a local veterinary clinic and these days a captive player in that all-American combat sport called applying to college. Chris 21 is a Santa Monica College engineering student who still lives at home but plans to transfer next year to the University of California Santa Barbara.         Â€ÂœWe may soon be empty nestersÂ€Âù Ms. Glusac says.

Â€Â” WHILE many existing oil and gas reserves in other parts of the world are facing steep decline the Arctic is thought to possess vast untapped reservoirs. Approximately 13 percent of the worldÂ€Â™s undiscovered oil deposits and 30 percent of its natural gas reserves are above the Arctic Circle according to the United States Geological Survey. Eager to tap into this largess Russia and its Arctic neighbors Â€Â” Canada Norway the United States Iceland and Denmark (by virtue of its authority over Greenland) Â€Â” have encouraged energy companies to drill in the region.         For Russia which recently seized a Greenpeace ship and is prosecuting 30 of the groupÂ€Â™s activists for attempting to scale an oil platform the temptation to exploit the Arctic Ocean is especially powerful. RussiaÂ€Â™s economy is heavily dependent on exports of oil and gas and the government relies on these sales for much of its income. Until recently the Russians could draw on reservoirs in western Siberia to satisfy their needs but now with many of these fields in decline they are counting on Arctic supplies to maintain current production levels. Â€ÂœOur first and main task is to turn the Arctic into RussiaÂ€Â™s resource base of the 21st centuryÂ€Âù Dmitri A. Medvedev then the president declared in 2008.         The Russians have explored drilling options in several offshore areas of the Arctic. In the Pechora Sea above northwestern Siberia the Russian energy giant Gazprom has installed its Prirazlomnaya platform Â€Â” the one protesting Greenpeace activists attempted to board. Further east in the Kara Sea the state-owned Rosneft is collaborating with ExxonMobil to develop promising deposits; Rosneft has also teamed up with Statoil of Norway and Eni of Italy to investigate prospects in the Barents Sea.         But Russia is hardly alone in seeking to exploit the Arctic. Norway like Russia derives considerable income from gas and oil exports and is under pressure to develop reserves in the Barents Sea to compensate for the decline of its existing fields in the North and Norwegian Seas. Other areas of the Arctic are also being eyed for development. Cairn Energy of Edinburgh has sunk exploratory wells in waters off Greenland for example while Royal Dutch Shell is attempting to develop fields off Alaska.         For all of its promise however the Arctic is not likely to surrender its resources easily. Sea ice covers much of the area in winter and storms pose a constant danger. Global warming is likely to reduce the extent of sea ice in the summer and fall permitting extended drilling operations but it could also produce unruly weather and other perils. Adding another layer of risk many of the boundary lines in the Arctic remain to be fully demarcated and various Arctic powers have threatened to use military force in the event that one or another intrudes on what they view as their sovereign territory.         The severe challenges of operating in the Arctic have already proved daunting for Shell which has spent $4.5 billion to exploit reserves off Alaska but has yet to drill a single producing well. Some of these challenges are legal Â€Â” indigenous communities and environmentalists fearing the contamination of local waters and a threat to wildlife have filed lawsuits to prevent the company from drilling.         In addition the Arctic itself has proved to be a formidable adversary: In the summer of 2012 during Royal Dutch ShellÂ€Â™s first attempt to probe its Arctic deposits shifting winds and floating ice halted drilling. Several months later when one of its drilling rigs ran aground during an especially severe storm Shell announced that it would suspend operations in AlaskaÂ€Â™s Arctic waters and that before it proceeded it would bolster its capacity to operate there.         ShellÂ€Â™s misfortunes have heightened concern that Arctic drilling poses an unacceptable threat to the region. Any major spill that occurs there is likely to prove far more destructive than the one produced in the Gulf of Mexico by the Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 2010 because of both the lack of adequate response capabilities and the likelihood that ice floes and sea ice will impede cleanup operations. As more companies push into the Arctic and accelerate their operations there the risk of accidents and spills is bound to increase. The fact that Shell Â€Â” one of the most technically advanced oil companies Â€Â” has so far proved unable to overcome these risks should provoke intense concern over the prospect that other less proficient firms will soon be operating in these perilous waters.        119,1E+14,0,Article,News,"In Season Filled With Lows, Knicks Outdo Themselves",Sports,844,5.502,5.419,Amid a season already brimming with poor performances the  It was a concerted effort that produced a 114-73 loss to the  Â€ÂœI canÂ€Â™t have our guys stepping on the court doing what they did todayÂ€Âù Woodson said his voice trailing to a whisper.

Â€ÂœI didnÂ€Â™t see this one coming.Â€Âù         The result was shocking only in the sense that the Knicks appeared to have moved past some of their early-season troubles with consecutive victories against the Nets and the Orlando Magic. Gone was the KnicksÂ€Â™ nine-game losing streak. Gone were their stagnant sets on offense. Gone was all the talk about WoodsonÂ€Â™s job security.         The Knicks could not handle prosperity not against the Celtics (10-12) who solidified their unlikely spot atop the Atlantic Division standings. Jordan Crawford collected 23 points and 7 assists as five teammates topped double figures in scoring.         Boston scored the gameÂ€Â™s first 12 points and then things really got out of hand. Late in the first quarter with the game quickly slipping toward parody Shumpert tossed up an air ball that the CelticsÂ€Â™ Jeff Green turned into a fast-break layup. Two possessions later Shumpert dribbled the ball off his foot and out of bounds. The Celtics extended their lead to 34-11 heading into the second quarter and the crowd began to boo. It was 58-31 by halftime.         Â€ÂœWe enjoyed it for sureÂ€Âù Green said.         The afternoon developed a rhythm. The Knicks would make a mistake (a carrying violation say or an errant jump shot) and the Celtics would capitalize in transition. Boston turned the game into an elaborate layup line shooting 54.2 percent over all including 56 percent from beyond the 3-point line.         The Knicks shot 34.2 percent and their reaction in the locker room was an odd mix. While Anthony clearly sounded upset several teammates Â€Â” including Felton Shumpert and J. R. Smith Â€Â” credited the CelticsÂ€Â™ hot shooting.         Â€ÂœI wouldnÂ€Â™t say we had a bad effortÂ€Âù said Felton who missed all six of his field-goal attempts. Â€ÂœThose guys were on fire. They came in it was like the basket was the size of an ocean.Â€Âù         It was a dreaded noon start for the Knicks who have labored with early tip times. (Exhibit A: Their 120-89 loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Nov. 10.) The Knicks were also missing Kenyon Martin a dependable Â€Â” albeit aging Â€Â” defender who was inactive with what Woodson described as a sore ankle.         And then there was the small matter of the KnicksÂ€Â™ attire. Despite losing all five games they had played while wearing orange uniforms this season the Knicks gave it another try. It was a mistake though their performance against the Celtics probably had more to do with an inability to play any semblance of cohesive team basketball.         After two games of operating as the hub of a sharing-is-caring offense Anthony reverting to isolation plays went 5 of 15 from the field and finished with 19 points. His approach made little sense. But then the Knicks have seldom been willing to make things easy on themselves.         On the KnicksÂ€Â™ fourth possession Anthony took dribble after dribble as he attempted to back his way into the post. He lost the ball before it was recovered by Shumpert who ignored Bargnani Â€Â” alone on the perimeter waving his arms like an orchestra conductor Â€Â” before flinging an ill-advised jumper that sailed a foot wide of the basket for a shot-clock violation.         Â€ÂœWe just couldnÂ€Â™t stick with itÂ€Âù Smith said referring to ball movement. Â€ÂœI know for us to be successful we have to swing swing swing swing.Â€Âù         Woodson who coached the game as James L. Dolan the teamÂ€Â™s owner sat courtside said he planned to dissect the game film ahead of TuesdayÂ€Â™s meeting with the Cleveland Cavaliers. It has become a sad ritual: another game another disappointment another series of mistakes to address.         Â€ÂœNobody should be happy about watching something like this happenÂ€Âù Woodson said.        111,1E+14,1,Article,News,Unarmed Man Is Charged With Wounding Bystanders Shot by Police Near Times Square,N.Y. / Region,439,5.862,4.826,An unarmed emotionally disturbed man shot at by the police as he was  The man Glenn Broadnax 35 of Brooklyn created a disturbance on Sept. 14 wading into traffic at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue and throwing himself into the path of oncoming cars.

Finally a police sergeant knocked Mr. Broadnax down with a  The shootings once again raised questions about the police use of firearms in crowded areas and drew comparisons to a shooting a year ago when officers struck nine bystanders in front of the  Initially Mr. Broadnax was arrested on misdemeanor charges of menacing drug possession and resisting arrest. But the Manhattan district attorneyÂ€Â™s office persuaded a grand jury to charge Mr. Broadnax with assault a felony carrying a maximum sentence of 25 years. Specifically the nine-count indictment unsealed on Wednesday said Mr. Broadnax Â€Âœrecklessly engaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœThe defendant is the one that created the situation that injured innocent bystandersÂ€Âù said an assistant district attorney Shannon Lucey.         The two police officers who have not been identified have been placed on administrative duty and their actions are still under investigation by the district attorneyÂ€Â™s office law enforcement officials said. Ã‚Â They also face an internal Police Department inquiry.         Mr. BroadnaxÂ€Â™s lawyer Rigodis Appling said Mr. Broadnax suffered from anxiety and depression and had been disoriented and scared when the police shot at him. He was reaching for his wallet not a gun she said. Â€ÂœMr. Broadnax never imagined his behavior would ever cause the police to shoot at himÂ€Âù she said.         After his arrest Mr. Broadnax was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center where he told a detective that Â€Âœhe was talking to dead relatives in his head and that he tried throwing himself in front of cars to kill himselfÂ€Âù according to a court document released on Wednesday.         A judge ordered a mental evaluation and a psychiatrist later found Mr. Broadnax competent to stand trial Ms. Appling said.         On Wednesday Justice Gregory Carro set bail at $100000 bond or $50000 cash.         Mariann Wang a lawyer representing Sahar Khoshakhlagh one of the women who was wounded said the district attorney should be pursuing charges against the two officers who fired their weapons in a crowd not against Mr. Broadnax. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s an incredibly unfortunate use of prosecutorial discretion to be prosecuting a man who didnÂ€Â™t even injure my clientÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s the police who injured my client.Â€Âù        4,1E+14,0,Article,News,Ads Use Famous Figures to Put a Face on a Problem,Business Day,948,5.716,5.76,As a campaign for a school for students in grades 5 through 12 seeks to encourage parents to enroll their children it also has a larger purpose: helping to change perceptions about students who are described with terms like learning disabilities learning differences special needs and special education.

The campaign carries a theme -- Â€ÂœEducating the exceptional Ã‚Â_Â€Âù -- that began as a phrase that appears numerous times on the website of  The campaign is being created pro bono by an agency in New York named  The total budget for the campaign through next year is estimated at more than $1.5 million.         Â€ÂœFor a lot of schools teachers the system of education learning is based on a deficit model: Â€Â˜WhatÂ€Â™s wrong with you? LetÂ€Â™s try to fix that'Â€Âù says Carl Sabatino headmaster of Bridges Academy.         He estimates that about 2 percent of all students Â€Âœsuffer operating under a deficit modelÂ€Âù because they are Â€Âœcapable of creating producing thinkingÂ€Âù but that goes unrecognized.         Â€ÂœYes they have these learning disabilitiesÂ€Âù Mr. Sabatino says Â€Âœbut they also have this potential that must be tapped.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœWe have to make sure we help all of themÂ€Âù he adds.         The historical figures are meant to Â€Âœpersonify the potential of these childrenÂ€Âù Mr. Sabatino says and help the campaign as it seeks to reach Â€Âœa larger audience.Â€Âù         Each famous face Â€Âœtakes you from a label to a person to an iconÂ€Âù he adds.         How did a New York agency end up creating work for a school in Los Angeles? As is often the case in advertising a personal connection figures in in this instance involving the vice chairwoman of the board of Bridges Academy Lori Lepler who is a parent of a seventh grader at the school her son Eli.         Ms. Lepler is a former New Yorker now living in the Los Angeles area who worked at New York agencies that included JWT then J. Walter Thompson; Frankfurt Gips Balkind; and Ogilvy & Mather. When Ms. Lepler worked as a senior vice president and management director at Thompson her counterparts on the creative side were the women who eventually founded the Terri & Sandy Solution Terri Meyer and Sandy Greenberg.         Â€ÂœTwo years ago when my son joined the school I realized it was a small school with a huge idea of an education modelÂ€Âù Ms. Lepler says adding that after she joined the Bridges Academy board Â€Âœas a board we developed with CarlÂ€Â™s stewardship brand positioning and strategy.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœAnd then I appealed to Terri and Sandy whom IÂ€Â™ve known for 20 years with whom I worked side by sideÂ€Âù to work on a campaign Ms. Lepler says. She praises Ms. Meyer and Ms. Greenberg for what she calls Â€Âœtheir strategic horsepower to problem-solve and their creative prowess.Â€Âù         After the agency came back with the campaign Ms. Lepler says Â€Âœwe immediately recognized Â€Â˜Wow this is us and this is big.'Â€Âù         The strong point is that the ads are focused Â€Âœon the end benefitÂ€Âù of an education at Bridges Academy she adds which is Â€Âœto unlock the potential of each student. These kids are so full of potential but you canÂ€Â™t fulfill it till you find it.Â€Âù         Ms. Greenberg says that she and Ms. Meyer as they began to work on the campaign decided to focus on how Â€ÂœBridges is an environment that builds on strengths to help students overcome their challenges.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœThere was this term on the website Â€Â˜twice exceptionalÂ€Â™ which IÂ€Â™d never heard ofÂ€Âù Ms. Greenberg says Â€Âœand we started looking into itÂ€Âù as a way to convey the mission of the school along with featuring the historical figures who may Â€Âœtoday be diagnosed as twice exceptional.Â€Âù         Ms. Meyer takes issue with a suggestion that the phrase will be dismissed as a euphemism an attempt to soft-pedal a problem or an example of marketing jargon.         Â€ÂœWe didnÂ€Â™t make it up; we were not coining a phraseÂ€Âù Ms. Meyer says. Rather Â€ÂœitÂ€Â™s a term accepted in that communityÂ€Âù of educators she adds which makes it Â€Âœa term thatÂ€Â™s acceptable.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœThere are no universal words to explain how these children areÂ€Âù Ms. Meyer says. Â€ÂœSomething meaningful something uplifting could make kids and parents feel better about themselvesÂ€Âù she adds compared with what she deems Â€Âœnegative terminologyÂ€Âù like Â€Âœlearning challengedÂ€Âù or Â€Âœlearning disabled.Â€Âù         -------         92,1E+14,1,Article,News,"Wall Street Mothers, Stay-Home Fathers",U.S.,2324,5.493,5.795,As Husbands Do Domestic Duty These Women Are Free to Achieve Marielle Jan de Beur often catches the 6:27 a.m. train to  But when the elevator lets her off at Wells Fargo she enters another zone where the gender dynamic that has long underpinned the financial industry is quietly being challenged. Ms. Jan de Beur and some of her colleagues rely on support that growing numbers of women on Wall Street say is enabling them to compete with new intensity: a stay-at-home husband.         In an industry still dominated by men with only a smattering of women in its highest ranks these bankers make up a small but rapidly expanding group benefiting from what they call a direct link between their ability to achieve and their husbandsÂ€Â™ willingness to handle domestic duties. The number of women in finance with stay-at-home spouses has climbed nearly tenfold since 1980 according to an analysis of census data and some of the most successful women in the field are among them.         When Ms. Jan de Beur flew to Hong Kong last spring to persuade Asian investors to re-enter the bond market her husband took their daughter to try on confirmation dresses. Her colleagues Allison Poliniak and Gina Martin Adams share a running commentary on their husbandsÂ€Â™ efforts in the kitchen. Nicole Black recently texted her husband Drew Skinner as she headed home after a long day of earnings calls. Â€ÂœYou want to hit the gym? Go for itÂ€Âù he replied agreeing to spend another hour with their two small sons.         Â€ÂœWhile I was dating Drew and getting married and having kids IÂ€Â™ve gone from vice president to director to managing directorÂ€Âù Ms. Black said.         These marriages are Wall Street-specific experiments in money work family and power. In interviews dozens of couples provided field notes on their findings.         Many discovered that even with babysitting and household help the demands of working in finance made a two-career marriage impossible. The arrangement can be socially isolating they said leaving both partners out of a child-rearing world still full of Â€ÂœMommy and MeÂ€Âù classes. The couples told of new questions of marital etiquette like who makes the big financial decisions or buys the wifeÂ€Â™s jewelry when she makes upward of a million dollars a year and the husband earns little or nothing.         It is not clear however if these couples are leaders in the march toward gender equality or examples of how little is shifting on Wall Street. The banks say they want to hire and retain more women.         But the solution that turns out to work so well for these women is an inaccessible option for many others since it requires one spouse to give up a career and the other to earn enough money to support the family. Rather than changing the culture of the banks which promote policies on flexible hours and work life balance these women say that to succeed they must give in to its sometimes brutal terms from 4:45 a.m. wake-ups onward through days of ceaseless competition.         Along the way the couples have come to question just what is male behavior and female behavior noting how quickly their preconceived notions dissolve once they depart from assigned roles. The men echo generations of housewives voicing concern over a loss of earning power and car pool-induced torpor but also pride in their nurturing roles. The women describe themselves as competitive tough and proud of every dollar they bring in.         Â€ÂœWeÂ€Â™re almost like an opposite Â€Â™50s coupleÂ€Âù said Mr. Skinner Nicole BlackÂ€Â™s husband. Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m staying at home I do the dishes I do the laundry I do everything the housewife does. IÂ€Â™m just a dude.Â€Âù         Not every marriage proceeds as smoothly. One female banker told colleagues that she recently became irritated with her husband who works part time telling him Â€ÂœI wish I had a wife.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœYou can get one when I can get oneÂ€Âù he replied.         Rye N.Y. is not an obvious place to mount a stand against established social roles. The town on the moneyed coast of Long Island Sound has long been populated by bankers including John J. Mack the former chief executive of Morgan Stanley. The clubs at the end of Stuyvesant Avenue have dress codes and sports like lawn bowling and despite high property taxes the town has no school buses a special torture for working parents.         But even Rye has a set of bankers with stay-at-home husbands among them Ms. Jan de Beur an executive in Wells FargoÂ€Â™s research department and her architect-turned-artist husband Jim Langley.         When they married 13 years ago some of Ms. Jan de BeurÂ€Â™s male colleagues scoffed suggesting that she would become useless in the workplace. Marriage turned out to be one of her better career moves. By the time she became pregnant her husband was working extremely long hours for an architecture firm that was pressuring him to relocate and he made less than half of what she did. The solution seemed obvious.         Ten years later the life they have put together feels comfortable and well ordered: two bright talkative children 10 and 7 years old; a white-clapboard house that feels more cozy than imposing; and time in a sunny third-floor studio for Mr. Langley who keeps books of work by Andrew Wyeth and Winslow Homer on his shelves. He has moments of wonder with his children like playing kickball during a summer rainfall and making anatomical sculptures from tree branches.         In interviews Ms. Jan de Beur driven and precise praised her husbandÂ€Â™s nurturing skills. Mr. Langley sounded proud if a bit taken aback by his wifeÂ€Â™s success. Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m aware of how lucky I amÂ€Âù he said.         Still his wife along with other women in the same situation suspects that the arrangement is harder on the men. Some of Mr. LangleyÂ€Â™s peers say the chatter at backyard gatherings about bonuses can make them wince: If a half-million-dollar salary is considered unimpressive in some Wall Street circles where does that leave them?         When people ask what he does Mr. Langley could say artist Â€Â” he gives the buildings and landscapes he paints expressive personalities of their own Â€Â” but he has just begun trying to sell his work. Other fathers in similar situations say they often tell white lies: They are retired they are consultants they work at home.         Mr. Langley generally goes with Â€Âœstay-at-home dad.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœThatÂ€Â™s what I call myselfÂ€Âù he said over lunch at a restaurant in Rye the other tables filled with groups of women. Â€ÂœI wouldnÂ€Â™t say I like it.Â€Âù         What response does he get?         Â€ÂœThereÂ€Â™s usually a long pauseÂ€Âù he said.         Half a century ago Betty Friedan wrote Â€ÂœThe Feminine MystiqueÂ€Âù not far from where some of the female bankers live today. Even though their husbands have had far different experiences and options than Ms. FriedanÂ€Â™s frustrated 1960s housewives they sometimes express similar sentiments.         Some wonder what has come of their education confess that they do not know how to make their way back to work after what they had hoped would be a temporary break or admit that they do not quite understand their wivesÂ€Â™ work. Others have turned themselves into eager helpmates booking their spousesÂ€Â™ massages and mastering complicated cooking techniques.         But many of the wives say their husbands approach parenthood differently than women do. The stay-at-home mothers in Rye often congregate at spinning or yoga classes but their male counterparts all seem to have a hobby involving a boat: sailing building wood kayaks and in Mr. LangleyÂ€Â™s case depicting fishing dinghies and half-finished hulls in his paintings. Despite their wealth the men seem largely resistant to relying on nannies and babysitters facing down screaming toddlers and constant meal preparation with go-it-alone stoicism.         Brandee McHale a managing director of CitigroupÂ€Â™s charitable foundation says her husband a former Marine does not multitask noting that for him Â€ÂœLaundry is an activity.Â€Âù But she also appreciates that he will focus just as intently on tossing a football with their children.         A few women said that they resented the fact that their husbands did not cook or clean up but that they had trouble telling them so for fear that they would sound as if they were treating them like employees.         When Kristine Braden also of Citigroup was stationed in the Philippines she knew that her husband was never going to devote himself to hosting parties for her clients or setting a perfect table the way some wives of male bankers did. (The couple entertained at restaurants or at home together on weekends.) Few of the men are willing to take on corporate spouse duties like attending or hosting Wall Street dinners with the alpha men who work at the banks.         The husbands often feel excluded from the social infrastructure that women have built up over generations to make stay-at-home life more manageable and fun. (Â€ÂœYou want awkward? Try a swim play dateÂ€Âù one father said.) Every man interviewed said that many school notices invitations and Girl Scout troop updates were still sent to their wives a river they are constantly trying to divert.         When Ed Fassler married to Marcie Fassler a vice president of operations at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh was helping out with a school wrapping paper sale the mothers gathered to go over the order Â€Â” and excluded him. Â€ÂœMy husband wouldnÂ€Â™t be happy if youÂ€Â™re in my house with usÂ€Âù the organizer told him.         In March Mr. Langley is renting space to mount a show of his paintings and his home studio is cluttered with canvases and taped-together snapshots of the local landscape. In a test run in September he offered two paintings for sale at an  In search of remedies four of JP Morgan ChaseÂ€Â™s top women decided to fan out across the country last summer to find out why too many women at the nationÂ€Â™s largest bank and across the industry still seemed somewhat stuck in their ascent.         For years JP Morgan and other banks have tried recruitment and retention efforts aimed at women including Â€Âœspeed mentoringÂ€Âù (Wells Fargo) wine tastings to get to know management (Morgan Stanley) efforts at hiring women who had taken time off to raise children (Goldman Sachs) and clubs for female bankers (Citigroup alone has 60).         When Diane Schumaker-Krieg Ms. BlackÂ€Â™s and Ms. Jan de BeurÂ€Â™s boss worked at Credit Suisse years ago the chief executive at the time Mr. Mack even flew her and other promising women to his home for a golf tutorial to help them network on the greens.         Still women make up just 16 percent of bank executives according to the consulting firm Catalyst and only a tiny number run the huge revenue-generating businesses like investment banking and trading barely a change from a generation before.         In their meetings with 2500 women at seven JP Morgan offices the four executives Â€Â” including Mary Callahan Erdoes the chief executive of the bankÂ€Â™s asset management division and Marianne Lake the chief financial officer Â€Â” heard the same messages again and again.         Flex time allowing employees to work from home one or more days a week carried stigma the women felt. Some said they were reluctant to chase promotions that could require moves upending their families. Many female bankers still quit after having children.         One morning last month around the time Ms. Lake was departing for a similar round of meetings in Asia Ms. Black arrived at her cluttered desk at Wells FargoÂ€Â™s office in Charlotte N.C. and slid on her headset to hear the latest Viacom earnings.         She tapped out a message for institutional investors dropped in on a morning meeting to brief salespeople and traders wrote a memo to clients about why she was downgrading CiscoÂ€Â™s debt and gave a talk to the sales force on a new bond all before the clock struck 9:30. During that sprint she was focused entirely on her work.         Ms. Black and others say that is the real gift of a stay-at-home spouse: avoiding domestic distractions and competing better against other bankers many of them men with stay-at-home wives.         If Ms. Black gets a call on Tuesday afternoon asking her to attend an out-of-town dinner the next night she can go. Ms. Jan de Beur took two trips a week on average last spring. Candida P. Wolff the head of global government affairs for Citigroup often travels about one and a half weeks each month.         Being the breadwinner often means being taken more seriously in the workplace they have learned. When one former banker was interviewing at a private equity firm she said her prospective employers wanted to know what her husband did and seemed pleased that he had a low-paying but flexible job and handled more parenting duties. It dawned on her that the presumption men had often benefited from Â€Â” that they would not be diverted by household demands Â€Â” was finally applying to her too.         On the home front the women cast the deciding votes on major financial decisions. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s not like when you and I were growing up and Dad made all the decisions but I still control the purse stringsÂ€Âù Ms. Black said.         At Wells FargoÂ€Â™s modernist tower on Park Avenue Ms. Schumaker-Krieg the global head of research economics and strategy for the bank is making new recommendations on how to retain and advance female employees. She has spent decades persuading women on her team not to quit even when they are put on bed rest during pregnancy or give birth to a child with special needs. And she would like others in the industry to follow suit.         She acknowledges that part of the problem is the fundamental nature of the business: the ceaseless race to score the big deals and anticipate market moves. Soon she will complete year-end tallies ranking the research analysts including Ms. Black and Ms. Jan de Beur against their competitors and each other.         Some of the women with stay-at-home husbands are her top performers. When she calls those men Â€Âœthe wind beneath our wingsÂ€Âù she sounds both kind and calculating; the more domestic responsibility the men are willing to assume the more their wives can help the bank make money.         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s easy to slide into irrelevance by backing off just a littleÂ€Âù she warned.        109,1E+14,1,Article,News,CBS to Correct Erroneous Report on Benghazi,Business Day,702,5.491,5.32,As it prepared to broadcast a rare on-air correction Sunday for a now-discredited Â€Âœ60 MinutesÂ€Âù report CBS News acknowledged on Friday that it had suffered a damaging blow to its credibility. Its top executive called the segment Â€Âœas big a mistake as there has beenÂ€Âù in the 45-year-old history of the celebrated news program.         The executive Jeff Fager conceded that CBS appeared to have been duped by the primary source for the report a security official who told a national television audience a harrowing tale of the attack last year at the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi Libya. On Thursday night it was disclosed that the official Dylan Davies had provided a completely different account in interviews with the F.B.I. in which he said he never made it to the mission that night.         After that revelation CBS decided to take multiple actions Friday. It removed the report from the CBS News website and the correspondent for the segment Lara Logan appeared on the CBS morning news show to apologize personally for the mistakes in the report. And the companyÂ€Â™s publishing division Simon & Schuster said it was suspending publication of a book by Mr. Davies in which he tells the same narrative he recounted on Â€Âœ60 Minutes.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s a black eye and itÂ€Â™s painfulÂ€Âù Mr. Fager said in a phone interview. He declined to say whether there would be negative consequences for any of the journalists involved.         The retractions and the scale of the mistake spurred comparisons with another embarrassing episode for CBS News Â€Â” a report in 2004 about George W. BushÂ€Â™s National Guard record that CBS was also forced to retract. That report which actually appeared on a short-lived spinoff program called Â€Âœ60 Minutes IIÂ€Âù resulted in several firings and played a role in the eventual separation between CBS and its longtime anchor Dan Rather.         Mr. Davies identified as Morgan Jones on the Â€Âœ60 MinutesÂ€Âù report and on the jacket of his book Â€ÂœThe Embassy HouseÂ€Âù gave three separate interviews to the F.B.I. according to Obama administration officials. Each time he described the events in ways that diverged from his account to CBS when he claimed to have been personally involved in the action during the attack Â€Â” to the point of disabling one of the attackers with a blow from a rifle.         His interviews with the F.B.I. disclosed Thursday night by The New York Times were critical in the unraveling of his story. Mr. Davies had already told his employer the security firm Blue Mountain that he never appeared at the mission the night of the attack and the firm had prepared an incident report with that information. Mr. Davies contended that he had not created or approved the incident report and that he had needed to lie to his employer because he had defied orders to remain at his villa. The justification for believing him Mr. Fager said Friday was Mr. DaviesÂ€Â™s assurance that he had told the real truth to the F.B.I. one that would corroborate his account to CBS.         With agents unable to operate freely in Benghazi the F.B.I. which is conducting an investigation into the attack has struggled to get interviews with the guards hired to protect the mission and other witnesses. That has forced the agents to rely on the accounts provided by State Department officials and contractors who have left the country. As part of those efforts the F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Davies by phone teleconference and in Wales where Mr. Davies lives. (Mr. Davies could not be reached Friday. Mr. Fager said he had told CBS News he had Â€Âœgone into hiding.Â€Âù)         Mr. Fager said CBS had been duped by a convincing liar. Â€ÂœThere are people in the world who try to deceive othersÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœWe believe we have a really good system to guard against that.

Mr. Fager said CBS had made extensive efforts to determine what Mr. Davies told the F.B.I.

The  In the report which was issued on Friday the court monitor Mark S. Cohen said the arrival of the new class would present Â€Âœboth opportunities and challenges for the F.D.N.Y.Â€Âù         Mr. Cohen noted the department had issued anti-retaliation and anti-harassment policies but said officials must ensure that Â€Âœfirehouse culture does not operate to deterÂ€Âù any of the new firefighters.         The report also criticized the department for failing to share Â€Âœa pro-diversity messageÂ€Âù broadly enough within the ranks. Department leaders challenged that assertion pointing to a memorandum circulated to firehouses two days before graduation that all but ordered a warm welcome for the new recruits known as probationary firefighters or probies.         The memorandum noted that although the 242 graduates came to the department through different recruitment lists Â€Â” and included some minorities who had tried and failed to enter the department earlier Â€Â” all completed the rigorous 18-week training course at the academy.         Â€ÂœWe expect they will be afforded the same welcome extended to every new probie and that veteran firefighters will serve as mentors and teachers to help them learn more and grow into their jobs as firefightersÂ€Âù the memorandum said. Â€ÂœUltimately no one should be judged according to their Â€Â˜listÂ€Â™ but rather how they perform in the role of newly minted probationary firefighter.Â€Âù         The new class is the product of litigation begun in 2007 when the United States Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the Fire Department after a black firefighters group the Vulcan Society complained that the entrance exams used by the department were biased against minority applicants.         A federal judge ruled against the department and ordered the creation of a new exam and reforms to hiring including the recruitment of some of the applicants who failed exams given in 1999 or 2002.         The judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of Federal District Court in Brooklyn appointed Mr. Cohen to oversee the reforms.         In his report Mr. Cohen noted the diversity of the new class: Over 60 percent of the probationary firefighters are minorities compared with a Fire Department that is nearly 90 percent white.         But the report found that blacks and Hispanics dropped out at various points of the recruitment process at higher rates than whites. This was particularly pronounced at the academy. Over 50 percent of the academy dropouts were so-called priority hires blacks and Hispanics who had not qualified on the 1999 or 2002 test and who in many cases were older than typical recruits.         Over all the dropout rate at the academy typically 10 percent was 24 percent for the recent class.         The report noted that no standards or requirements were lowered or changed for the most recent class and said it was premature to draw conclusions about the causes of the higher dropout rates.         Â€ÂœIt should be noted that the Fire Academy is highly demanding both physically and academicallyÂ€Âù the report said. Â€ÂœAll candidates Â€Â” including priority hires as well as all other hires Â€Â” must meet the same Fire Academy requirements and standards to graduate.Â€Âù        86,1E+14,1,Article,Op-Ed,Are Kids Too Coddled?,Opinion,754,5.79,5.617,AT a middle school near Boston not long ago teachers and administrators noticed that children would frequently return from a classmateÂ€Â™s weekend bar mitzvah with commemorative T-shirts swag that advertised a party to which many fellow students hadnÂ€Â™t been invited.         So administrators moved to ban the clothing.         They explained in a letter to parents that Â€Âœwhile the students wearing the labeled clothing are all chatting excitedlyÂ€Âù the students without it Â€Âœtend to walk by trying not to take notice.Â€Âù What an ordeal.         Many parents favored the ban a prophylactic against disappointment.         Some did not noting that life would soon enough deal the kids much worse blows along these lines. And one observer in a Facebook thread said this according to a local TV stationÂ€Â™s  I assume thatÂ€Â™s facetious.         But these days you never know.         I occasionally flash on that anecdote as I behold the pushback against more rigorous education standards in general and the new  Duncan defending the Common Core at an education conference identified some of its most impassioned opponents as  It was an impolitic bit of profiling. Gratuitous too. But if you follow the fevered lamentations over the Common Core look hard at some of the complaints from parents and teachers and factor in the modern cult of self-esteem you can guess what set Duncan off: a concern wholly justified that tougher instruction not be rejected simply because it makes children feel inadequate and that the impulse to coddle kids not eclipse the imperative to challenge them.         The Common Core a laudable set of guidelines that emphasize analytical thinking over rote memorization has been adopted in more than 40 states. In instances its implementation has been flawed and its accompanying emphasis on testing certainly warrants debate.         WhatÂ€Â™s not warranted is the  Then thereÂ€Â™s the outcry equally reflective of the times from adults who assert that kids arenÂ€Â™t enjoying school as much; feel a level of stress that they shouldnÂ€Â™t have to; are being judged too narrowly; and doubt their own mettle.         ArenÂ€Â™t aspects of school supposed to be relatively mirthless? IsnÂ€Â™t stress an acceptable byproduct of reaching higher and digging deeper? ArenÂ€Â™t certain fixed judgments inevitable? And isnÂ€Â™t mettle established through hard work?         Apparently not to judge from some reactions to the Common Core in New York which has been holding hearings on the guidelines.          A SOCIAL WORKER  A teacher on Long Island did more than wonder  Â€ÂœIf thatÂ€Â™s not child abuse I donÂ€Â™t know what isÂ€Âù she thundered to wild applause. Then she endorsed the idea of parentsÂ€Â™ exempting kids from Common Core-related tests. Â€ÂœThe mommies in New YorkÂ€Âù she concluded Â€ÂœdonÂ€Â™t abuse their children.Â€Âù         If children are unraveling to this extent itÂ€Â™s a grave problem. But before we beat a hasty retreat from potentially crucial education reforms we need to ask ourselves how much panic is trickling down to kids  There are sports teams and leagues in which no kid is allowed too much more playing time than another and in which excessive victory margins are outlawed. Losing is looked upon as pure trauma to be doled out gingerly. After one Texas high school football team beat another last month by a lopsided score of 91-0 the parent of a losing player  It used to be that trophies went to victors; now in many leagues they go to everybody Â€Â” for participation. Some teams no longer have one or two captains elected by the other players but a rotating cast so that nobodyÂ€Â™s left out.         Some high schools have 10 20 or 30 valedictorians along with bloated honor rolls and a surfeit of graduation prizes. Many kids at all grade levels are Bubble-Wrapped in a culture that praises effort nearly as much as it does accomplishment.         And praise itself is promiscuous though there are experts with profound reservations about that approach. They say it can lessen motivation and set children up to be demoralized when they invariably fail at something.         Â€ÂœOur students have an inflated sense of their academic prowessÂ€Âù  David Coleman one of the principal architects of the Common Core told me that heÂ€Â™s all for self-esteem but that rigorous standards Â€Âœredefine self-esteem as something achieved through hard work.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœStudents will not enjoy every step of itÂ€Âù he added. But if it takes them somewhere big and real theyÂ€Â™ll discover a satisfaction that redeems the sweat.         And theyÂ€Â™ll be ready to compete globally an ability that too much worry over their egos could hinder. As Tucker observed Â€ÂœWhile American parents are pulling their kids out of tests because the results make the kids feel bad parents in other countries are looking at the results and asking themselves how they can help their children do better.Â€Âù        6,1E+14,1,Article,News,They Loved Your G.P.A. Then They Saw Your Tweets.,Business Day,571,6.158,5.645,At Bowdoin College in Brunswick Me. admissions officers are still talking about the high school senior who attended a campus information session last year for prospective students. Throughout the presentation she apparently posted disparaging comments on Twitter about her fellow attendees repeatedly using a common expletive.         Perhaps she hadnÂ€Â™t realized that colleges keep track of their social media mentions.         Â€ÂœIt was incredibly unusual and foolish of her to do thatÂ€Âù  Â€ÂœWe would have wondered about the judgment of someone who spends their time on their mobile phone and makes such awful remarksÂ€Âù Mr. Meiklejohn said.         As certain high school seniors work meticulously this month to finish their early applications to colleges some may not realize that comments they casually make online could negatively affect their prospects. In fact new  Of 381 college admissions officers who answered a Kaplan telephone questionnaire this year 31 percent said they had visited an applicantÂ€Â™s Facebook or other personal social media page to learn more about them Â€Â” a five-percentage-point increase from last year. More crucially for those trying to get into college 30 percent of the admissions officers said they had discovered information online that had negatively affected an applicantÂ€Â™s prospects.         Â€ÂœStudentsÂ€Â™ social media and digital footprint can sometimes play a role in the admissions processÂ€Âù says Christine Brown the executive director of K-12 and college prep programs at Kaplan Test Prep. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s something that is becoming more ubiquitous and less looked down upon.Â€Âù         In the business realm employers now vet the online reputations of job candidates as a matter of course. Given the impulsiveness of typical teenagers however Â€Â” not to mention the already fraught nature of college acceptances and rejections Â€Â” the idea that admissions officers would covertly nose around the social media posts of prospective students seems more chilling.         There is some reason for concern. Ms. Brown says that most colleges donÂ€Â™t have formal policies about admissions officers supplementing studentsÂ€Â™ files with their own online research. If colleges find seemingly troubling material online they may not necessarily notify the applicants involved.         Â€ÂœTo me itÂ€Â™s a huge problemÂ€Âù said  These kinds of concerns prompted me last week to email 20 colleges and universities Â€Â” small and large private and public East Coast and West Coast Â€Â” to ask about their practices. Then I called admissions officials at 10 schools who agreed to interviews.         Each official told me that it was not routine practice at his or her institution for admissions officers to use Google searches on applicants or to peruse their social media posts. Most said their school received so many applications to review Â€Â” with essays recommendations and often supplemental portfolios Â€Â” that staff members wouldnÂ€Â™t be able to do extra research online. A few also felt that online investigations might lead to unfair or inconsistent treatment.         Â€ÂœAs studentsÂ€Â™ use of social media is growing thereÂ€Â™s a whole variety of ways that college admissions officers can use itÂ€Âù  Other admissions officials said they did not formally prohibit the practice. In fact they said admissions officers did look at online material about applicants on an ad hoc basis. Sometimes prospective students themselves ask an admissions office to look at blogs or videos they have posted; on other occasions an admissions official might look up an obscure award or event mentioned by an applicant for purposes of elucidation.

Iraq is experiencing a protracted wave of sectarian violence that has increased since the American military withdrawal in 2011 a level of strife not seen since 2006 and 2007.

Â€ÂœLet the people decide the direction of the country and who the governing majority will beÂ€Âù the prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra said in a televised statement on Monday morning.         The news came as thousands of protesters who have vowed to overthrow the government and rid the country of the influence of Ms. YingluckÂ€Â™s family marched toward the prime ministerÂ€Â™s office.         The call for elections which were not due until 2015 did not satisfy many of the protest leaders who reacted with scorn minutes after the announcement. Â€ÂœThis is not our objectiveÂ€Âù Anchalee Paireerak a protest leader said of the elections. Â€ÂœWe will continue marching.Â€Âù         Protests in Bangkok have left five people dead and hundreds injured over the past two weeks. Ms. Anchalee and other protest leaders have called for a system that would replace the countryÂ€Â™s electoral democracy with a vaguely defined Â€ÂœpeopleÂ€Â™s councilÂ€Âù a plan that civic leaders and scholars have widely derided as idealistic unworkable and retrograde.         The opposition in Thailand has been deeply frustrated by its inability to win elections against the powerful political machine backed by the billionaire tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra a former prime minister who now lives in exile. Ms. Yingluck is Mr. ThaksinÂ€Â™s sister.         On Sunday the Democrat Party ThailandÂ€Â™s oldest and the main force behind the countryÂ€Â™s political opposition announced that its members would resign from Parliament and join antigovernment street demonstrations.         Â€ÂœWe cannot beat themÂ€Âù said Theptai Seanapong one of the members of Parliament who resigned on Sunday. Â€ÂœIt doesnÂ€Â™t matter if we raise our hands and feet in parliamentary votes we will never win.Â€Âù         Sathit Wongnongtoey one of the protest leaders and a former member of Parliament for the Democrat Party said on Monday that he feared there would be Â€ÂœcheatingÂ€Âù in the election if the government carried on as caretakers as the Constitution stipulates.         Â€ÂœAnd they will return to powerÂ€Âù Mr. Sathit said. Â€ÂœWe cannot allow that to happen.Â€Âù         The mistrust of electoral politics has echoes across the region Â€Â” in Malaysia where the governing party has heavily gerrymandered the electoral map and in Cambodia where the authoritarian prime minister Hun Sen has used the machinery of the state and military to bolster his power. The Cambodian opposition continues to boycott Parliament over allegations of widespread electoral fraud in July elections.         One major difference in Thailand however is that there is little dispute that Mr. ThaksinÂ€Â™s party has won the hearts of the majority of voters. By tailoring its policies to voters in the provinces especially in northern Thailand scholars say the governing Pheu Thai Party has convincingly won every election since 2001.         Though the opposition has repeatedly said that Mr. Thaksin has maintained his power through vote buying two of ThailandÂ€Â™s leading political researchers wrote a widely circulated article last week that said the allegation was Â€Âœdangerous nonsenseÂ€Âù because it was policies not vote buying that have cemented the loyalty of many voters in the provinces toward Mr. Thaksin.         As ThailandÂ€Â™s peak tourism season gets underway embassies have advised their citizens to avoid the protest areas.         The Democrat Party has many grievances with Mr. ThaksinÂ€Â™s party including what it considers the railroading of some spending bills voting procedures in Parliament that a court has called illegal and the furtive passage of important laws in the early hours of the morning.         Yet for a party that has long cultivated a genteel and intellectual image and advocated resolving differences inside Parliament the decision to take to the streets was contentious within its own ranks.

Â€Â”  Â€ÂœThe U.S. boys are so fastÂ€Âù said Marcel Hirscher of Austria the defending World Cup overall winner who finished third Sunday and admitted to only recently removing a poster of Miller from the wall of his childhood bedroom. Â€ÂœThe rest of the world all we can do is say Â€Â˜Oh my God they are so good.Â€Â™Ã‚Â Â€Âù         The reigning giant slalom world champion Ligety proved again that he is Mr. G.S. as he is known on the World Cup circuit winning with an aggregate time of 2 minutes 35.77 seconds which was 1.32 seconds ahead of Miller an enormous margin in a sport where victory is often determined by hundredths of a second.         Â€ÂœIt looks so effortless when he skis but he just annihilates guysÂ€Âù Miller said.         LigetyÂ€Â™s win his third straight at Beaver Creek was also his fourth straight giant slalom victory tying a record held by Alberto Tomba who won four consecutive giant slaloms in 1991. Ligety who has won the World Cup giant slalom title four times has eight victories in the last 10 giant slalom races. Â€ÂœAnytime you get a win is awesome especially in the U.S.Â€Âù Ligety said.         He added Â€ÂœAnd to share the podium with Bode is awesome.Â€Âù         The surprise of the day came when Miller who missed all of last season with a knee injury surged to second from a starting position of 31st after the first run. He skied an amazing second run to hold onto that second-place spot. It was his first time on a giant slalom podium since 2007.         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s impressive that he was able to bring his intensity up and put down some impressive runsÂ€Âù Ligety said.         It was hard not to sense a budding rivalry between the two.         Â€ÂœI knew after the first run that it was probably unlikely to beat Ted; heÂ€Â™s just a really clutch performer in those kinds of situationsÂ€Âù Miller said. Â€ÂœBut I wanted to make sure when I got to the finish line that I at least let him know that IÂ€Â™m coming for him.Â€Âù         To the dismay of many including his coaches who advised Miller to focus solely on speed events this season Miller said he believed he could beat Ligety in the giant slalom. Ligety did not seem convinced.         Â€ÂœThe speed he had today was impressiveÂ€Âù Ligety said Â€Âœso itÂ€Â™s going to be a matter of if he can pull the consistency off.Â€Âù         Ligety has a finely honed technique in which he arcs wide around every gate using each curve to gather speed for the next but he takes little risk and makes few mistakes.         Â€ÂœHeÂ€Â™s so good at what he does and nobody is testing him right now because everyone is trying to do what he doesÂ€Âù Miller said. Â€ÂœI donÂ€Â™t do what he does. I ski round in some parts and unbelievably straight in other parts.Â€Âù         Miller said: Â€ÂœIf I ski perfect with my technique I think my max speed is higher than his. But itÂ€Â™s obviously a lot harder for me to ski without mistakes.Â€Âù         MillerÂ€Â™s approach rides the line between risk and reward and it often leads to dazzling results or spectacular defeat.

The once maverick poster boy of American skiing now a married man and father of two displayed his exceptional natural talent once again to finish second in a men's giant slalom 1.32 seconds behind compatriot Ted Ligety in Beaver Creek.         While Ligety's victory his fourth consecutively in the Colorado resort was almost business as usual Miller's runner-up placing was a genuine sensation.         Forced out of skiing for more than a year by a knee operation the old man of the circuit at 36 had not been on a World Cup podium for 22 months.         His resurrection was all the more spectacular as it took place in a giant slalom a discipline in which he had not finished in the top three since 2007 in Lenzerheide.         Ligety the man who replaced him at the helm of American skiing was the first to congratulate his team-mate.         ""It's awesome to see Bode back here. He's a little bit up and down in training but he managed to pull it together today"" Ligety said.         The crowd discovered quite a different Miller in the finish area.         Fitter after losing weight in the summer the usually indifferent champion raised his fist after crossing the line a sign that the result meant a lot to him.         And it did especially in front of his wife beach volleyball player and model Morgan Beck who now travels with him and his daughter on the World Cup circuit.         ""It's so funny to be sandwiched behind these two young guys"" said Miller who finished half a second ahead of Austrian overall World Cup holder Marcel Hirscher.         ""When I skied my first Olympics Marcel was probably still jumping around in a playground. But while I was away Ted and Marcel took the GS to a level which did not exist when I left"" he added.         Yet Miller showed he still had the adaptability to remain a contender.         Starting with the number 31 bib on his back he fought a promising battle in the morning run.         ""I knew after the first run that I was there. I only wanted to make sure to get the message across in the second"" said the American who was second fastest in each leg.         He might be the oldest man on the World Cup circuit with Swiss downhill Olympic champion Didier Defago yet Miller still retains the ambitions of a rookie.         And he said he was now especially keen to shine again in slaloms a discipline in which he has not won a race in nearly a decade.         ""Today is a redemption and what I did here I want to do it again in slaloms. That's also the reason why I'm so skinny and dynamic"" Miller said.         He warned that he might never have been in such great form.         ""There are still bits and pieces to adjust. But in the past when I skied here in Beaver Creek I had no legs left in the Golden Eagle (section). Now seriously I could have done a couple more gates"" he said.

Month-on-month consumer prices fell 0.1 percent against market expectations of being flat the National Bureau of Statistics said.         Food prices rose 5.9 percent in November from a year earlier slowing from October's 6.5 percent rise.         ""Inflation will not be a big problem in the coming months and we expect monetary policy to stay neutral"" said Luo Wenbo an economist at Xiangcai Securities in Shanghai.         Producer prices fell 1.4 percent in November from a year earlier - the 21st consecutive month of decline - versus a fall of 1.5 percent in the previous month the bureau said. On a monthly basis producer prices were unchanged.         Economists polled by Reuters had expected consumer inflation to match October's 3.2 percent rate and factory-gate prices to decline 1.4 percent.         A strong jump in exports and a run of surveys of factory and service sector activity indicate the world's second-largest economy has regained some momentum since arresting a protracted slowdown in the middle of the year.         On Tuesday data on factory output fixed-asset investment and retail sales will offer another gauge of how the economy is performing just as leaders are expected to meet this week to set policy and reform priorities for 2014.         They have pledged to steer the economy away from its dependence on investment and exports to one driven more by consumption services and innovation which they consider more sustainable.         A Reuters poll in October showed annual growth was forecast to slow to 7.5 percent in the final quarter of 2013 from 7.8 percent in the September quarter. Full-year growth was forecast at 7.6 percent - the weakest in 14 years but just ahead of the government's target of 7.5 percent.         Top government think tanks which make policy proposals for the leadership are still debating whether the government should cut its annual economic growth target to 7 percent in 2014.

The  At brunch on Sunday patrons from 7 to 70 dined on golden chicken from Dongbei in northern China and plump shrimp from the Yellow Sea. Gray skies cast a soft light through tall windows into the dining room of the mansion constructed in 1903 as one of the first Western-style buildings in Beijing the capital.         The guests including women dressed in pearls and high heels men in sweaters and jeans and two children Audrey 7 and Alex 13 who with their mother Ly Vu have been frequent patrons all gathered to say farewell.         Â€ÂœWe adore the restaurant the ambience and the serviceÂ€Âù said Mrs. Vu a Vietnamese American living in Beijing as she and her children finished eating a chicken that had been carved at the table by the executive chef Brian Reimer. Â€ÂœWe love the juicy chicken with crispy skinÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœThe dining room is homey yet elegant. ItÂ€Â™s very sad it is closing.Â€Âù         For Mr. BouludÂ€Â™s dining empire now at 13 restaurants including establishments in Singapore London and Toronto a closing is unusual. A venture in Las Vegas shut in 2010 but another is set to open there said Brett Traussi director of operations for the Dinex Group which manages the Boulud gourmet brand.         Beijing is known as a tough restaurant town a place of politicians and bureaucrats banquet halls and back-room deals. Shanghai is ChinaÂ€Â™s boisterous city still nurturing the traditions left over from the Europeans who lived and played there in the 1920s and Â€Â™30s.         Along the Bund in Shanghai at least five European restaurants lavishly decorated and with sparkling views of the Yangtze River vie for expense account customers. In Beijing where foreign diplomats are penurious and government officials prefer Chinese restaurants there were three distinguished Western eateries. Now there are two.         Â€ÂœShanghai is pragmatic moves faster and is more business focusedÂ€Âù said Michelle Garnaut chief executive of the M Restaurant Group which runs M on the Bund in Shanghai and Capital M one of the surviving Western-style restaurants in Beijing.         Â€ÂœLetÂ€Â™s hope Boulud finds somewhere else in BeijingÂ€Âù Ms. Garnaut said. Â€ÂœIt has been an excellent restaurant.Â€ÂùÃ‚Â          Mr. Boulud has not given up on the Beijing restaurant scene. Â€ÂœOur partners have other ambitions for the buildingÂ€Âù he said in a telephone interview from Lyon France. Â€ÂœBeijing is becoming a very cool place. IÂ€Â™ve always liked Beijing. I want the setup to be right the partners to be right.Â€Âù         Acquiring the ingredients for a Western menu was one of the great challenges in Beijing he said. Many were imported: beef from Australia salmon from Alaska oil and vinegar from Hong Kong. He was delighted to find yellow-skinned chicken from Dongbei that came close to the stronger taste of the free-range poultry of the Landes region of France.         But a few items including some herbs were impossible to find. Thyme rosemary and basil could be grown fresh in the kitchen. Chervil and tarragon plants proved too delicate to flourish. Dried tarragon was the only solution.         Maison Boulud had a certain cachet because of its home in the two-story structure that served as the American Embassy; it was one of the first buildings in the capital to use imported steel and lumber from the United States.         Newspaper accounts from the period note that Sidney H. Nealy an architect for the State Department designed the chancery separate residences servantsÂ€Â™ quarters and an ice factory. Â€ÂœThese buildings are such as might be put up in Washington for a similar purposeÂ€Âù said an article in The Washington Post. Â€ÂœThey are in every respect first-class gray brick and granite structures with every modern improvement.Â€Âù The article said Mr. Nealy learned Â€Âœenough of the language to handle the native laborersÂ€Âù who Â€Âœhad to be taught in an American way.Â€Âù         When the Communists took power in 1949 the embassy set on a square known as the Legation Quarter became the property of the government. Before the 2008 Olympics developers leased the chancery and the accompanying buildings and renovated them for commercial use in what was planned as a plaza of restaurants and galleries.         The interior of the chancery where the Maison Boulud dining room is on the first floor retains much of its original look. The white carved banister of the staircase the black and white marble floors in the bar area and broad beam timber floors in banquet rooms upstairs are still intact.         A large room at the back of the lobby now swathed in red wallpaper was described by the restaurant as the place where Henry A. Kissinger and Zhou Enlai met secretly in 1971 to plan President Richard M. NixonÂ€Â™s visit to China the following year.         In fact those meetings took place at the Diaoyutai State Guest House compound some distance from the old American Embassy said Winston Lord who participated in the 48 hours of talks as an aide to Mr. Kissinger. Mr. Lord later became United States ambassador to China.         Â€ÂœWe left Diaoyutai once Â€Â” for a secret tour of the Forbidden City followed by a secret lunch with Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the PeopleÂ€Âù Mr. Lord said.         But if the legend of the Kissinger-Zhou meeting turned out not to be accurate there are many memories to cherish for the Maison Boulud archives some of them quintessential Beijing.         Not long after the restaurant opened a successful Chinese businessman from a coal-mining region in Shanxi Province hosted a dinner for a dozen guests. He ordered the best vintage French burgundies and the most expensive dishes Mr. Reimer the chef said.         When the $23000 bill arrived the businessman called his driver who delivered two bags filled with Chinese bank notes to the table to pay the tab.        161,1E+14,0,Article,News,Champions League Set for Some Much-Needed Drama,Sports,786,5.526,5.702,"BERNE Â€Â” The Champions League is set for some much-needed drama this week with the conclusion of a group stage which has been all too predictable and produced an embarrassing procession of one-sided matches.         Eight places in the round of 16 are still up for grabs with much of the attention focussed on Group F where Napoli Borussia Dortmund and Arsenal are battling for two spots.         With Juventus and AC Milan each needing a point to qualify against tricky opponents Italy could end up with all three of their teams in the last 16 or none at all.         Benfica's chances of reaching the final in their own Estadio da Luz are out of their hands and will be prematurely ended if Olympiakos beat winless Anderlecht while their compatriots Porto also face an uphill battle.         Swiss champions Basel whose two wins over Chelsea have provided the only real upsets need a point to progress at the expense of Bundesliga side Schalke 04.         Shakhtar Donetsk Bayer Leverkusen Zenit St Petersburg and Ajax Amsterdam are also still in with a chance of going through.         Manchester United Real Madrid Paris St Germain Bayern Munich Manchester City Chelsea Atletico Madrid and Barcelona have safely qualified and can use the games to give their lesser-used players a run-out.         So far four games in the group stage have been won by five-goal margins six games won by four goals and 13 matches have ended with a difference of three goals.         Despite the group stage's predictable nature this season has at least proved more competitive than last term when 13 of the 16 knockout stage places had been booked before the final round of group matches.         As expected Group F has turned out to be by far the toughest.         Leaders Arsenal (12 points) travel to Napoli (9) needing a draw or a defeat by less than three goals while Borussia Dortmund (9) will go through if they beat pointless Olympique Marseille away regardless of the other result.         Should Napoli and Dortmund both win they will finish level with Arsenal on 12 points and the qualifiers will be decided by the results between the three teams.         Group E will also have a dramatic finish when habitual over-achievers Basel (8 points) visit spectacularly inconsistent Schalke (7) needing a point to join Chelsea in the last 16.         Despite their dismal domestic form seven-times champions AC Milan (8) should get the point they need at home to Ajax Amsterdam (7) and follow Barcelona through from Group H.         ""The Dutch have achieved great results and have good technique and we must take all the necessary precautions"" said Milan's unflappable coach Massimiliano Allegri whose future is the source of constant speculation.         ""We have to score a goal we cannot think of playing for the 0-0.""         FORMIDABLE REPUTATION         A point also appears to be well within the reach of Serie A leaders Juventus (6) when they visit Galatasaray (4) in Group B especially as they Turks' formidable home reputation took a huge knock when they were thrashed 6-1 by Real Madrid.         Juventus have won their last seven league games without conceding a goal and would be in the last 16 already had they not conceded a late goal at home to Galatasaray and drawn 2-2.         ""We made qualification more difficult for ourselves and it's only right that now we have to resolve the situation"" said Juventus coach Antonio Conte.         Zenit St Petersburg (6) are favourites to follow Atletico Madrid through from Group G and give Russian football a boost as they visit winless debutants Austria Vienna for their final match.         Porto (5) have a tough trip to Atletico and although the Spaniards are already through their Argentine coach Diego Simeone is not known for allowing his teams to relax.         Benfica and Olympiakos (both 7 points) will duel for the second qualifying place in Group C where Paris St Germain are already through.         The Greeks are firm favourites as they have the better head-to-head record and need only to beat bottom side Anderlecht at home while the Portuguese host formidable PSG.         Group A where Manchester United are qualified is also set for a nerve-wracking finale.         Shakhtar Donetsk (8) are currently second but must visit Old Trafford while Bayer Leverkusen who are a point behind have a much easier trip to Real Sociedad who have mustered only one point so far.         Bayern Munich's home clash with Manchester City which should have been one of the highlights of the group stage is effectively a friendly as both teams qualified from Group D with two games each to spare.         Matches in Groups A to D will be played on Tuesday and Groups E to H on Wednesday.

These directives which oppose abortions inevitably collide with a hospitalÂ€Â™s duty to provide care to pregnant women in medical distress. This tension lies at the heart of a federal lawsuit   Despite acute pain and bleeding Ms. Means was sent home twice and when she returned a third time with a fever from her untreated infection she miscarried even as the paperwork was being prepared to discharge her again. The fetus died soon after.         The case has gained attention because Ms. Means is not suing the hospital for medical negligence but the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The A.C.L.U. is arguing on her behalf that having issued the mandates and made them conditions of hospital affiliation the conference is responsible for Â€Âœthe unnecessary trauma and harmÂ€Âù that Ms. Means and Â€Âœother pregnant women in similar situations have experienced at Catholic-sponsored hospitals.Â€Âù         How the suit will play out is unclear but it showcases an important issue.

Â€ÂœYou have a lot of knowledge a lot of awareness of whatÂ€Â™s likely to comeÂ€Âù said Dr. J. Andrew Billings from his home in Cambridge Mass.         Dr. Billings 68 and semi-retired is an expert in palliative care which can include managing pain emotional support and end-of-life planning. He is also a cancer patient with a life-threatening form of lymphoma. Dr. Billings said that knowledge of what may be ahead can give doctors more control over their quality of life before they die Â€Â” control that eludes many of us.         Research shows that most Americans do not die well which is to say they do not die the way they say they want to Â€Â” at home surrounded by the people who love them.  There is no statistical proof that doctors enjoy a better quality of life before death than the rest of us. But research indicates they are better planners. An  Patients and families often pay a high price for difficult and unscripted deaths psychologically and economically. The Dartmouth Atlas Project which gathers and analyzes health care data found that 17 percent of  Â€ÂœWe havenÂ€Â™t bent the cost curve on end-of-life careÂ€Âù said Dr. David C. Goodman a senior researcher for the project.         The amount spent in the intensive care unit is climbing. Between 2007 and 2010 Medicare spending on patients in the last two years of life jumped 13 percent to nearly $70000 per patient.         The evidence is clear Dr. Goodman said that things could change if doctors Â€Âœrespect patient preferences and provide fair information about their prognosis and treatment choices.Â€Âù         Sometimes that can be easier said than done even for doctors. One day last month as he sat through the first of several hours of chemotherapy at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston Dr. Billings said he had looked at statistical survival curves for his form of lymphoma.         Â€ÂœThere are some dots that are very very soon and there are some dots that are a long ways off and I hope IÂ€Â™m one of those distant dotsÂ€Âù he said.         Dr. Billings knows how important it is to have that information. As a palliative care doctor he has spent a lifetime helping people plan their final days. Also he is married to a prominent palliative care doctor Dr. Susan D. Block.         Â€ÂœAs a doctor you know how to ask for thingsÂ€Âù he said. But as a patient Dr. Billings said he had learned how difficult it can be to push for all the information needed. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s hard to ask those questionsÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s hard to get answers.Â€Âù        110,1E+14,0,Article,News,A Scholar Is Back Home and Defiant in Hungary,World,1075,6.158,5.551,BUDAPEST Â€Â” Â€ÂœDuring my years abroad both in the U.S. and Australia I always said that I liked living there but that I want to be buried in my home in  It is generous of Ms. Heller to preserve affection for a homeland that has been so unkind to her. She was born and raised in the cityÂ€Â™s Jewish ghetto in the volatile political climate of 1930s Central Europe. Ms. Heller and her mother narrowly escaped deportation to Auschwitz; her father perished there.         In the postwar years she studied philosophy under the Hungarian Marxist Georg Lukacs and later became part of the so-called Budapest School around him Â€Â” radical thinkers calling on Hegel and the humanist works of early Marx to reinvigorate contemporary Marxism.         In the aftermath of the 1956 revolution in Hungary Ms. Heller though a socialist and Communist Party member was imprisoned by the Soviet-backed hard-liners for promoting counterrevolutionary thinking and banned from working at a university.         In 1977 she emigrated to Australia as a political exile. During the 1980s Ms. Heller rethought her political views becoming highly critical of orthodox Marxism. She subsequently assumed the Hannah Arendt visiting professorship of philosophy and political science at the New School for Social Research in New York where she lived and taught political theory for 25 years.         But itÂ€Â™s more than sentimentality that compels Ms. Heller to stay in Hungary where she is professor emeritus at BudapestÂ€Â™s esteemed Eotvos Lorand University. Her experience and knowledge are needed here she says particularly now.         And peers like the political scientist Andras Bozoki professor at the Central European University are grateful to have her: Â€ÂœSheÂ€Â™s a model of a freethinker and free citizen. Agnes HellerÂ€Â™s a globally known scholar who believes it is the role of intellectuals to engage civicallyÂ€Âù he said.         In recent years Ms. Heller has become a leading figure speaking out against the policies of Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his party Fidesz.         Mr. Orban has been criticized by the European Union and human rights groups for limiting freedoms of expression among other controversial political moves. In higher education critics say Mr. Orban has gradually stripped away universitiesÂ€Â™ independence. His administration for example has required that the government itself appoint university rectors.         The atmosphere many say is one of fear and uncertainty. Pressure has been brought to bear on the countryÂ€Â™s liberal-minded intellectuals those defiant enough to protest Â€Â” among them Agnes Heller. In the international news media as well as the handful of independent outlets still in business in Hungary Ms. Heller decries HungaryÂ€Â™s authoritarian drift and underscores the responsibility of its scholars as well as its ordinary citizens to resist.         The government says these charges are nonsense. Â€ÂœAgnes Heller is doing what she always does: complaining loudly abroad whenever thereÂ€Â™s an anti-communist government in power in BudapestÂ€Âù said Andras Doncsev deputy minister at the Ministry of Human Resources which is responsible for education. Hungarian universities are world-renowned and enjoy full academic freedom he added.         Ms. HellerÂ€Â™s words earned her the wrath of the Orban administration as early as 2011 when she and a handful of other academics were accused by a government commission of embezzling research funds earmarked for translations. In early 2012 the charges were dropped for lack of evidence.         Â€ÂœThere was nothing to the charges at allÂ€Âù said Anna Gacs an associate professor of media studies at Eotvos Lorand University and a founder of the University LecturersÂ€Â™ Network a faculty group formed to protect the public universities from government interference. Â€ÂœIt was the regimeÂ€Â™s first attempt to control the critical intelligentsia.Â€Âù         Speaking with a reporter in her small apartment high above the Danube River Ms. Heller said the government Â€Âœknew there was nothingÂ€Âù in the charges. Â€ÂœBut this is their strategyÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœThey make these kinds of accusations spread them all over their loyal media outlets and thus blacken the names of their opponents. By targeting liberals they blacken the name of liberalism itself.

Over four decades Mr. Negm (pronounced NEG-em) wrote verse in colloquial Arabic that channeled the privations and grim humor that were part of working-class life. His fearless and often mocking critiques of power made him a folk hero but also earned him a total of 18 years in jail.         With little recognition from the establishment except as derision Â€Â” President Anwar el-Sadat once called him Â€Âœthe obscene poetÂ€Âù Â€Â” Mr. NegmÂ€Â™s reputation as a counterculture poet grew in the poor neighborhoods where he lived and among students leftists and others who passed around his writings or tapes of his performances.         His personality was as diverting as his poems: He cursed and teased extolled the virtues of hashish and boasted about his many marriages. On a wall of his home he painted a line of poetry: Â€ÂœGlory to the crazy people in this dull life.Â€Âù         Mr. NegmÂ€Â™s work which owed debts to earlier Egyptian vernacular poets and to leftist authors both chronicled the countryÂ€Â™s modern history and served as an accompaniment to its struggles. Young activists mined his poems for inspiration and transformed them into chants of protest.         His words echoed across Tahrir Square in Cairo during the 2011 uprising against President Hosni Mubarak Â€Âœas if they were specifically written for that momentÂ€Âù his friend Mr. Enaba said. Lines from his poem Â€ÂœWho Are They and Who Are We?Â€Âù became a chanted slogan in the square marking EgyptÂ€Â™s perennial struggles and sharpening the lines of the battle at hand.         They were Â€Âœthe sultansÂ€Âù and the people were Â€Âœthe war: its kindling its fireÂ€Âù the poem read.         Â€ÂœThey wear the latest fashionsÂ€Âù the protesters shouted Â€Âœand we live seven to a room.Â€Âù         Mr. Negm started writing in the late 1950s during a three-year prison sentence on a forgery charge. After he was released in 1962 he published his first book Â€ÂœImages From Life and Prison.Â€Âù         In the 1960s he teamed up with Sheikh Imam Eissa a composer and oud player who put music to Mr. NegmÂ€Â™s verse. Their collaboration made both men famous and established them among EgyptÂ€Â™s foremost dissidents. They were roommates for a spell and were locked up together too. The partnership lasted for more than 20 years.         One composition which criticized President Gamal Abdel Nasser after EgyptÂ€Â™s defeat in the 1967 war with Israel landed Mr. Negm and Sheikh Imam in jail. Sadat who succeeded Nasser as president released them but sent Mr. Negm back to prison a few years later for mocking his speaking style.         Little was sacred in Mr. NegmÂ€Â™s world: He skewered Islamists government functionaries Richard M. Nixon and even EgyptÂ€Â™s most famous singer Umm Kulthum in poems that spread beyond Egypt.         Sinan Antoon an Iraqi poet who teaches literature at New York University first came across one of Mr. NegmÂ€Â™s books Â€ÂœEgypt Wake Up!Â€Âù as a teenager in Baghdad.         Â€ÂœWhen you read or hear his poetry you are struck by the power of his language and its intricate rhythms and registersÂ€Âù Mr. Antoon wrote in an email. Â€ÂœAt times itÂ€Â™s almost incantational.Â€Âù         In Mr. NegmÂ€Â™s poems Mr. Antoon said Â€Âœthe aesthetic and the political went hand in hand.Â€Âù         EgyptÂ€Â™s chronic inequality and decades of political stasis gave Mr. NegmÂ€Â™s work a timeless quality. Words he wrote in 1967 about official attempts to pacify ordinary Egyptians never lost their resonance:         DonÂ€Â™t tire your brain         in the work of politics         mind your own business         with vim and vigor         Ahmed Fouad Negm was born on May 22 1929 in the village of Kafr Abu Negm north of Cairo. His father a police officer died when he was 6 and his mother unable to provide for Mr. Negm and his siblings placed him in an orphanage in the city of Zagazig.         After leaving the orphanage he worked as a laborer on a British military base as a farmhand and as a street vendor before his first imprisonment in 1959.         Mr. Negm was married at least five times and as many as eight; friends who had known him for decades were not sure. In 1972 he married the journalist and literary critic Safinaz Kazem. Their daughter Nawara Negm is a prominent Egyptian activist. In addition to her and his last wife Omaima Abdel-Wahab survivors include two other daughters Afaf and Zeinab Negm.         A few days before he died with Egypt once again mired in civil conflict and tilting toward authoritarian rule Mr. Negm fretted about the countryÂ€Â™s path.         But his beloved revolutionaries were still in the streets. Â€ÂœThe youth we have are devilsÂ€Âù he said affectionately.

But I was still struggling with the difference between meiosis and parthenogenesis.         Dr. David Page the zippy evolutionary biologist teaching a class Wednesday called Â€ÂœAre Males Really Necessary?Â€Âù had helpfully laid out some props to illustrate gene swapping Â€Â” bananas apples and heads of lettuce arranged on a table covered with a flowery white tablecloth.         Â€ÂœSince only females can give birth why is it of any advantage to the species to have a second sex?Â€Âù he asked. Â€ÂœWhy should nature bother with males?Â€Âù         He told the packed classroom about the ingenious genetic feat of the Laredo striped whiptail lizards in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas and Mexico.         Â€ÂœThis species is a Girls Only club and the girls reproduce by cloning themselvesÂ€Âù Dr. Page said. Â€ÂœIn the species with males life is pretty routine. The females produce eggs the males produce sperm fertilization occurs and the male-inclusive life cycle is completed. In species without males life has a different texture. The females produce eggs but the eggs do not need sperm. ThatÂ€Â™s parthenogenesis which is a big word that means we understand absolutely nothing about how this works.Â€Âù         He said old-fashioned fertilization (meiosis) beats cloning (parthenogenesis) because as genes mutate Â€Âœmales provide females with spare parts.Â€Âù         It had been eight years since IÂ€Â™d talked to Dr. Page director of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research about doomsday predictions that we were hurtling toward a planet without men in a mere 100000 to 10 million years.         The Y chromosome was shedding genes and wilting into a mere remnant of its once mighty structure. Y declinists were arguing that from sperm count to social status men were vanishing Snapchat-style.         The Y had shrunk to a fraction of the size of its partner the X chromosome. (Obviously Stephen Colbert told Dr. Page it had just gotten out of the pool.)         The Y-sky-is-falling predictions mirrored Hanna RosinÂ€Â™s thesis in Â€ÂœThe End of MenÂ€Âù showing that women are consolidating power Â€Â” as graduates breadwinners single mothers consumers.         Indeed former Clinton money guy Terry McAuliffe would not be the new governor of Virginia if his Republican opponent Ken Cuccinelli had not scared off single women by belonging to a state party crew that was chasing women around with wands trying to do transvaginal probes.         Even back when I first talked to Dr. Page Â€Â” known as Mr. Y Â€Â” he cast himself as Â€Âœthe defender of the rotting Y chromosome.Â€Âù         He painted a picture of the Y as Â€Âœa slovenly beastÂ€Âù sitting in his worn armchair surrounded by boxes and pizza crusts.         Â€ÂœThe Y wants to maintain himself but doesnÂ€Â™t know howÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœHeÂ€Â™s falling apart like the guy who canÂ€Â™t manage to get a doctorÂ€Â™s appointment or clean up the house or apartment unless his wife or girlfriend does it.Â€Âù         But as it turned out it was a mistake to underestimate a chromosome that had for centuries madly attacked annexed enslaved pillaged plundered inseminated and thrust forward to create great art architecture and literature.         Driven no doubt by lust and ego the Y heroically revived.         Â€ÂœThe Y chromosome did essentially fall asleep at the wheel about 200 to 300 million years ago not long after we parted evolutionary company with birds while we were still pretty close to our reptilian ancestorsÂ€Âù Dr. Page tells me now. Â€ÂœAnd then at the last minute before the car veered off the cliff the Y chromosome woke up and got with the program and said Â€Â˜I donÂ€Â™t have a lot left but what I have left IÂ€Â™m going to keep.Â€Â™Â€Âù         Dr. Page and Dr. Jennifer Hughes led a team that decoded the Y chromosome of rhesus monkeys which share a common ancestor with humans and discovered that the YÂ€Â™s gene shedding leveled off about 20 to 30 million years ago. In the YÂ€Â™s cliffhanger the chromosome used its toolbox to repair some of its genes and became fastidious about not allowing the other genes to be damaged.         As The TimesÂ€Â™s Nicholas Wade  While the Y was shrinking the Â€ÂœbuxomÂ€Âù X as Wade dubbed it Â€Â” formerly considered Â€Âœa staid pristine relicÂ€Âù as Dr. Page says Â€Â” was growing larger and stronger acquiring new bunches of genes some of which play roles in producing sperm.         But just when the Y thought it was safe to go back in the water a new American study in the journal Science shows that mice with only two Y chromosome-derived genes can produce cells capable of joining with an egg to make a new mouse.         Â€ÂœScientists have practically obliterated the ultimate symbol of maleness in DNA the Y chromosomeÂ€Âù the BBC reported Â€Âœand believe they may be able to do away with it completely.Â€Âù         Which brings us to a recent Sarah Silverman tweet: Â€ÂœDear Men Just b/c we donÂ€Â™t need you anymore doesnÂ€Â™t mean we donÂ€Â™t WANT you! Love forever Women.Â€Âù        71,1E+14,0,Article,Op-Ed,Saving the Fed From Itself,Opinion,784,5.754,5.397,CAMBRIDGE Mass. Â€Â” THE Federal Reserve is pursuing a very risky monetary policy. Its leaders Â€Â” the departing chairman Ben S. Bernanke and the vice chairwoman Janet L. Yellen whom President Obama has nominated to succeed him Â€Â” are correct that the American economy needs more stimulus and they believe that the central bank because of political paralysis is the only game in town. But if Congress and the Obama administration could agree on a fiscal stimulus that goes beyond a short-term budget deal the Fed would not have to take such risks.         The FedÂ€Â™s strategy has been to stimulate the economy by driving down long-term interest rates by amassing long-term bonds and pledging to keep short-term rates near zero. A result has been to increase home and stock prices and by lifting household wealth encourage consumer spending.         But the magnitude of the effect has been too small to raise economic growth to a healthy rate. Home building has increased rapidly but from such a low level that its contribution to gross domestic product has been very small. And the increase in total consumer spending has slowed despite the soaring stock market.         The net result is that the economy has been growing at an annual rate of less than 2 percent. (The latest estimate that the economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.6 percent in the third quarter overstates the strength of demand because half of that increase was just because of inventory accumulation.) Weak growth has also meant weak employment gains. The decline in unemployment to 7 percent as announced on Friday has largely reflected the decreasing number of people looking for work. Total private-sector employment is actually less than it was six years ago.         While doing little to stimulate the economy the FedÂ€Â™s policy of low long-term interest rates has caused individuals and institutions to take excessive risks that could destabilize the economy just as it did before the 2007-9 recession. It has pushed up the values of everything from Iowa farmland to emerging-market bonds. Banks are lending to lower-quality commercial borrowers. Households are seeking higher returns by investing in real estate trusts and other high-risk products.         Although the Fed is expected to Â€ÂœtaperÂ€Âù its bond buying its promise to keep long-term interest rates abnormally low means that it is unwittingly encouraging private investors and institutions to continue to take risks.         A bipartisan House-Senate conference committee on the budget is  To get the economy back on track President Obama should propose and Congress should enact a five-year fiscal package that would move the growth of gross domestic product to above 3 percent a year and focus on direct government spending on infrastructure.         Although the mission of the military has been reduced with the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan there is also substantial need to replace and repair the equipment of the armed forces. Some of this aid could also extend to state and local governments.         The total price tag over five years would have to exceed $1 trillion to achieve the needed rise in the economic growth rate. The lack of Â€Âœshovel-readyÂ€Âù projects is not an excuse for not pursuing this strategy or for diverting the funds into income transfers and other low-impact spending of the kind that made the 2009 stimulus so ineffective. It would be better to spend a year or two preparing for the right kind of spending.         It would be irresponsible however to add another trillion dollars to the national debt without higher revenues or lower spending. Doing so would frighten financial markets and business executives reducing private spending and offsetting the stimulusÂ€Â™s benefits.         The key therefore is to combine a major short-term fiscal stimulus with long-term deficit reductions that would cause the ratio of debt to gross domestic product to begin declining by the end of this decade. Slowing the growth of Social Security and Medicare and raising revenue by limiting the subsidies that are built into the tax code could shrink future deficits to less than 2 percent of gross domestic product enough to put the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio on a path back to the 40 percent level that we had before the recession. That should be the goal for this Congress or the next one. And it would allow the Fed to stop trying to shoulder Â€Â” with increasing futility Â€Â” the burden of saving the economy all by itself.        177,1E+14,0,Article,News,UN Worries Aid Has Not Reached Philippine Victims,World,241,5.54,5.348,"CANBERRA Australia Â€Â” The United Nations is investigating reports that aid has yet to reach remote parts of the Philippines a month after a devastating typhoon the U.N. humanitarian chief said on Monday.         Valerie Amos U.N. Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator said she had expected that aid had been delivered by helicopter to survivors in even the most remote outlying islands following the Nov. 8 disaster.         ""Although we've got significant aid now coming in to the major centers we still have a little bit of a worry that in a couple of the smaller islands that there may be needs there that we haven't managed to meet yet"" she said.         ""I'm still hearing worrying reports in the media Â€Â” indeed I heard one this morning Â€Â” where people said they hadn't received any aid as yet and we're looking into that"" she said.         Typhoon Haiyan and its tsunami-like storm surge plowed through Tacloban and other coastal areas leaving more than 5700 dead and more than 1700 missing throughout the region. About 4 million people were displaced.         Amos in Australia for aid talks with the government defended the Philippine government against criticisms that it was too slow to deliver aid to victims.         She said the Philippines responded to more than 20 typhoons a year and was well prepared for storms.

"85,1E+14,0,Article,News,Venezuelan Mayoral Votes Show No Big Power Shift,World,679,5.835,5.517,CARACAS Venezuela Â€Â” Venezuelans went to the polls on Sunday to elect hundreds of mayors around the country in a vote seen as an early test of the fledgling president NicolÃƒÂ¡s Maduro and his ability to carry the country further along the socialist path laid out by his predecessor and mentor Hugo ChÃƒÂ¡vez.         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s like a thermometer to see if the government is doing good or badÂ€Âù said JosÃƒÂ© de Corral 60 a schoolteacher who backs the government. He had just come from voting as shown by the purple ink on his pinkie finger applied at the polling station as part of a system to keep people from voting more than once. In a country deeply divided between government supporters and opponents Mr. de Corral said the election would Â€Âœshow who is stronger.Â€Âù         But the results did not show a major shift in the countryÂ€Â™s political alignment. Opposition leaders had hoped to win a majority of the total votes cast in mayoral races nationwide but the head of the national electoral commission Tibisay Lucena announced that with more than 97 percent of votes transmitted Mr. MaduroÂ€Â™s United Socialist Party had received 44 percent compared with 41 percent for the main opposition coalition. Other parties including some allied with the government received the remainder.         The government party retained control of the largest municipality in Caracas the capital while the opposition held on to what is known as the metropolitan mayoralty there as well as the mayoralty of Maracaibo the second largest city in Venezuela. The opposition did gain some ground winning races in Valencia and Barquisimeto which had been held by the ruling party.         Nine months after  Inflation is 54 percent a year growth is sputtering and government restrictions on hard currency have throttled back imports. Many basic products like toilet paper and corn flour are in short supply and when they do show up consumers often have to wait in long lines to buy them.         Other chronic problems include electrical failures such as one just days before the election that knocked out power to Caracas the capital and much of the western half of the country.         Mr. Maduro had appeared weak after  Mr. Maduro claims that the countryÂ€Â™s problems are caused by enemiesÂ€Â™ waging an Â€Âœeconomic warÂ€Âù against his government and the electrical failures by sabotage.         Â€ÂœThe people have told the world that the revolution continuesÂ€Âù he said late Sunday.         Ms. Lucena said the ruling party had kept control of a majority of the countryÂ€Â™s 337 mayoralties. But the opposition made gains in some key cities like the capital of Barinas Mr. ChÃƒÂ¡vezÂ€Â™s home state and a bastion of government support. Voters also cast ballots for thousands of local legislators.         Caracas has six mayors: one in each of the cityÂ€Â™s five municipalities and a general metropolitan mayor. The opposition had held five of the six posts.         Opposition leaders cast the election as a referendum on Mr. MaduroÂ€Â™s government but were frustrated in their hope to win a majority of votes nationwide.         Henrique Capriles the opposition leader who ran against Mr. Maduro in April had traveled around the country to campaign for local candidates and to some degree the outcome of the election could be seen as a test of his leadership and his ability to extend his personal popularity to the rest of the opposition.         The election was characterized by the widespread use of government resources in favor of the ruling partyÂ€Â™s candidates. In the Caracas subway system for example giant posters supported the mayoral candidacy of the United Socialist Party incumbent in the cityÂ€Â™s largest municipality Libertador. Government-operated television stations continually promoted Socialist candidates and vilified the opposition.        58,1E+14,1,Article,News,Scale of Destruction Slows Relief Efforts in Philippines,World,676,5.506,5.521,CEBU Philippines Â€Â” The scale of the devastation and the desperation wrought by one of the most powerful storms ever to buffet the Philippines came into much clearer view on Monday three days after it hopscotched across the countryÂ€Â™s midsection whipping up monstrous walls of seawater.         Survivors spoke of people being swept away in tsunami-like torrents their corpses strewn among the wreckage of the storm Typhoon Haiyan.         Residents of the hard-hit city of Tacloban described a terrifying experience Friday evening as Haiyan hit with seawater suddenly filling the streets rising within minutes until it had submerged the ground floors of homes and was waist-deep on the second floors of those that had second floors. Screaming people bobbed in the water Â€Â” many grabbing for floating debris but not all succeeding.         Â€ÂœSwirling water from the ocean filled the streetsÂ€Âù said Virginia Basinang 54 a retired teacher in Tacloban. Â€ÂœSome of them were able to hold on some were lucky and lived but most did not.Â€Âù When the water receded 14 bodies lay on the broken wall of the house across the street from her home Ms. Basinang said. They were still there she said.         Drizzle began turning into rain just before midnight on Monday in Tacloban and through the early morning hours it became torrential at times adding further misery for Filipinos still trying to occupy homes that lost part or all of their roofs during the typhoon. Dirt roads began turning to mud by dawn on Tuesday raising another obstacle for relief workers.         By some estimates at least 10000 people may have died in Tacloban alone. But with phone service out across large stretches of this central Philippines archipelago it was not yet known if the storm had been as deadly in more remote areas. With winds that reached 190 miles an hour according to some accounts the typhoon hit with a force that approached that of a tornado.         The main effect appeared to be a storm surge driven by the winds believed to be among the strongest ever recorded in the Philippines lifting walls of water onto the land as they struck.         Brig. Gen. Domingo Tutaan Jr. a spokesman for the armed forces said Â€ÂœI donÂ€Â™t have words to describe what our ground commanders are seeing in the field.Â€Âù         United Nations officials said Monday that Valerie Amos the organizationÂ€Â™s top relief official was en route to the Philippines to lead the international aid effort which had already begun mobilizing on the ground. Ms. Amos the under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator released $25 million from an emergency response fund to help pay for immediate priorities and planned to launch a Â€Âœflash appealÂ€Âù for more money when she arrived on Tuesday.         Â€ÂœWe are focused first and foremost on the requirements for food shelter medical support to prevent the outbreak of public health disastersÂ€Âù John Ging the operations coordinator for United Nations relief told reporters in New York.         Asked if he thought the death toll could rise Mr. Ging said Â€ÂœWe hope it doesnÂ€Â™t get any higher but we have to be prepared for the worst.Â€Âù         The effort led by the United Nations came as the United States significantly raised its assistance to the Philippines. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel who had ordered 90 Marines and half a dozen aircraft to assist in rescue and assessment work over the weekend on Monday ordered the USS aircraft carrier George Washington and other Navy ships in the Pacific Â€Âœto make the best speed for the Republic of the Philippines.Â€Âù         The George Washington which carries 5000 sailors and more than 80 aircraft was ordered to depart from a port visit in Hong Kong and the crew was recalled from shore leave immediately.         Richard Gordon the chairman of the Philippine Red Cross said that a Red Cross aid convoy to Tacloban had to turn back on Sunday after it stopped at a collapsed bridge and was nearly hijacked by a crowd of hungry people. Â€ÂœThere is very little food going in and what food there was was capturedÂ€Âù by the crowd Mr. Gordon said Monday morning in a telephone interview.        18,1E+14,1,Article,News,Vast Challenges for Philippines After Typhoon,World,667,5.52,5.275,CEBU Philippines Â€Â” Three days after one of the most powerful storms ever to buffet the Philippines the scale of the devastation and the desperation of the survivors were slowly coming into view.         The living told stories of the dead or dying Â€Â” the people swept away in a torrent of seawater the corpses strewn among the wreckage. Photos from the hard-hit city of Tacloban showed vast stretches of land swept clean of homes and reports emerged of people who were desperate for food and water raiding aid convoys and stripping the stores that were left standing.         As Monday dawned it became increasingly clear that Typhoon Haiyan had ravaged cities towns and fishing villages when it played a deadly form of hopscotch across the islands of the central Philippines on Friday. By some estimates at least 10000 people may have died in Tacloban alone and with phone service out across stretches of the far-flung archipelago it was difficult to know if the storm was as deadly in more remote areas.         Barreling across palm-fringed beaches and plowing into frail homes with a force that by some estimates approached that of a tornado Haiyan delivered a crippling blow to this countryÂ€Â™s midsection. The culprit increasingly appeared to be a storm surge that was driven by those winds which were believed to be among the strongest ever recorded in the Philippines lifting a wall of water onto the land as they struck. By some accounts the winds reached 190 miles an hour.         As aid crews struggled to reach ravaged areas the storm appeared to lay bare some of the perennial woes of the Philippines. The countryÂ€Â™s roads and airports long starved of money by corrupt and incompetent governments are some of the worst in Southeast Asia and often make traveling long distances a trial. On Monday clogged with debris from splintered buildings and shattered trees the roads in the stormÂ€Â™s path were worse slowing rescue teams.         Richard Gordon the chairman of the Philippines Red Cross said that a Red Cross aid convoy to Tacloban had to turn back on Sunday after it stopped at a collapsed bridge and was nearly hijacked by a crowd of hungry people. Â€ÂœThere is very little food going in and what food there was was capturedÂ€Âù by the crowd Mr. Gordon said in a telephone interview on Monday morning.         The storm posed new challenges for President Benigno S. Aquino III who just two months ago struggled to wrest back a major city in the south from insurgents. Mr. Aquino has won plaudits at home and abroad for his fight against corruption during his three and a half years in office leading to increased foreign investment and an impressive growth rate. But he must still contend with Muslim separatists in the south and with provinces that have long been the domains of regional strongmen resistant to government control.         Now add to that list a storm that looks to be one of the countryÂ€Â™s worst disasters at a time when emergency funds have been depleted by a series of other calamities most notably an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 that struck the middle of the country four weeks ago. On Monday after the reports of widespread raiding of stores and robberies and rising fears of a breakdown of law and order the government said it was flying more police officers to the region.         Although deadly storms are not unusual in the Philippines Typhoon Haiyan appears to stand apart both in the ferocity of its winds which some described as sounding like a freight train and in its type of destruction. Most deaths from typhoons in the Philippines are caused by mudslides and rivers flooding from heavy rains.         So when Haiyan sped across the islands on Friday some officials and weather experts in the Philippines thought they had witnessed something of a miracle. The storm that lit up social media for days with dire warnings was thought to have mostly spared the islands because it did not linger long enough to dump a deluge of rain.        196,1E+14,0,Article,News,"Chicago Girl, 2, Dies in Dog Attack at Kin's Home",U.S.,92,6.302,4.687,CHICAGO Â€Â” A 2-year-old Chicago girl's death from a dog attack over the weekend has been ruled a homicide by the Cook County Medical Examiner's office.

The Blackhawks used their potent offense to win after starting goalie Corey Crawford left in the first period because of a lower-body injury.         Marian Hossa Brent Seabrook and Brandon Saad each had goal and an assist and Michal Handzus and Andrew Shaw also scored. Patrick Kane had three assists for Chicago which ended a three-game losing streak Â€Â” its longest regular-season skid since February 2012.

Crawford was forced out with 6:15 left in the first and the Blackhawks ahead 2-0 moments after he went down to make a right pad save on Marcel Goc.         He was unable to get back up on his skates and had to be helped from the ice by teammates and a trainer.

Sharp and Seabrook scored power-play goals in the first period to give Chicago a 2-0 lead.         Sharp opened the scoring 1:10 in. His shot from the top of the slot sailed past Clemmensen.         Seabrook made it 2-0 when he pinched to the right circle took a cross-ice pass from Saad and fired in a low shot.         Raanta made a couple of close-in saves late in the first to preserve the lead.         Hossa increased Chicago's advantage to 3-0 just 37 seconds into the second popping in a rebound of Sharp's shot.         Olsen cut it to 3-1 at 4:05 when he closed in from the left point and beat Raanta with a high screened shot.         Goc trimmed it to 3-2 with an unassisted goal after Raanta failed to clear the puck off the boards.         Handzus' goal with 2:34 left in the second made it 4-2.         Shaw's power-play goal at 2:44 of the third extended Chicago's lead to three goals.         Hayes knocked off Raanta's mask at 8:39 of the third when he drove hard to the net.

He was 88.         His death was confirmed by a spokesman for the Democratic Alliance a multiracial party considered the successor to the all-white liberal group led by Mr. Eglin intermittently from 1971 to 1994 when  Mr. Eglin was known as a shrewd tactician and political organizer who leveraged the influence of a tiny liberal minority Â€Â” within South AfricaÂ€Â™s ruling white minority population Â€Â” to achieve modest but symbolically important victories.         He was among the few white members of Parliament to visit the black activist Steve Biko before Mr. Biko died in his jail cell in 1977 from repeated police beatings. Mr. EglinÂ€Â™s Progressive Reform Party sent the first delegation of white politicians to hold talks on ending apartheid with leaders in the so-called tribal homelands impoverished territories where the government forced many black South Africans to live. Blacks outnumbered whites in South African by about 37 million to 10 million.         Mr. EglinÂ€Â™s commitment to gradual change made him a stabilizing force Â€Â” and a target of vitriol from all sides Â€Â” in South AfricaÂ€Â™s increasingly polarized atmosphere during the final decades of institutionalized white supremacy.         Prime Minister John Vorster called Mr. EglinÂ€Â™s party a Â€Âœcoffee clubÂ€Âù for wealthy whites who could declaim against apartheid secure in the knowledge that they would never actually govern.         Other anti-apartheid activists and revolutionaries including members of the African National Congress the countryÂ€Â™s dominant black political organization considered Mr. Eglin no less guilty than the ruling far-right National Party for the sins of apartheid rule simply by virtue of his participation in the system. Fellow liberals less patient than he with the pace of change often called him irrelevant.         He nonetheless held to the middle ground.         Refusing to join a boycott of elections in 1987 he proclaimed that Â€Âœat this stage in our countryÂ€Â™s historyÂ€Âù the Progressive Reform opposition party in Parliament was essential Â€Âœto oppose and expose the policies and excesses of apartheid.Â€Âù         Mr. EglinÂ€Â™s pragmatism and his ability to maintain communications with all sides made him an uncontested choice to serve on an interracial national committee charged with drafting a new Constitution in 1990 when Prime Minister F. W. de Klerk began what became a three-year process of ending apartheid.         In Â€ÂœOne Law One Nation: The Making of the South African ConstitutionÂ€Âù (2011) by Lauren Segal and Sharon Cort Mr. Eglin was quoted describing his strategy in negotiating with both the African National Congress and the National Party. Â€ÂœI had a simple ruleÂ€Âù he told the authors. Â€ÂœIf you wanted anything  Colin Wells Eglin was born in Sea Point South Africa on April 14 1925 the son of Elsie May and Carl August Eglin. Both parents belonged to the Methodist Church of Southern Africa whose hierarchy had opposed apartheid since it was introduced in 1948 by the National Party. The apartheid laws stripped black and mixed-race people of their citizenship prohibited interracial marriage and sanctioned policies restricting the job opportunities education housing and general freedom of movement of all nonwhites.         After Mr. EglinÂ€Â™s father died in 1934 his mother sent him to live with a married older sister on a farm in the eastern part of the country. He attended public school there and graduated from the University of Cape Town.         After serving in the Army during World War II he joined a construction company as a surveyor. He had become a partner in the firm by the time he won his first election to public office as a town councilor in Pinelands a suburb of Cape Townin 1950.         He then became involved in the Progressive Party which merged with other groups to become the Progressive Federal Party in 1977. Its Constitution called for full citizenship rights for all South Africans regardless of race or color.         Mr. Eglin led the party caucus in the House of Assembly the whites-only national parliamentary body from 1977 to 1979 and again from 1986 to 1988.         He is survived by his wife Joyce Mabel Cortes Eglin; three daughters; and five grandchildren.         In his later years as democracy took root in South Africa and the African National Congress became the governing party Mr. Eglin came to see that political equality was only the beginning Â€Â” and that all bets were off for democracy in his still-divided country unless its growing numbers of poor and unemployed citizens could find work.         Â€ÂœIn the long run multiparty democracy will only work if multiparty democracy delivers the goods for the people of the countryÂ€Âù he said in an interview for the Nelson Mandela Center of Memory the national archive in 1999. Â€ÂœThe greatest single challenge is getting a dramatic increase in economic growth.Â€Âù        37,1E+14,1,Article,News,Sleep Therapy Seen as an Aid for Depression,Health,624,5.863,5.427,Curing insomnia in people with depression could double their chance of a full recovery scientists are reporting. The findings based on an insomnia treatment that uses talk therapy rather than drugs are the first to emerge from a series of closely watched studies of sleep and depression to be released in the coming year.         The new report affirms the results of a smaller pilot study giving scientists confidence that the effects of the insomnia treatment are real. If the figures continue to hold up the advance will be the most significant in the treatment of depression since the introduction of Prozac in 1987.         Depression is the most common mental disorder affecting some 18 million Americans in any given year according to government figures and more than half of them also have insomnia.         Experts familiar with the new report said that the results were plausible and that if supported by other studies they should lead to major changes in treatment.         Â€ÂœIt would be an absolute boon to the fieldÂ€Âù said Dr. Nada L. Stotland professor of psychiatry at Rush Medical College in Chicago who was not connected with the latest research.         Â€ÂœIt makes good common sense clinicallyÂ€Âù she continued. Â€ÂœIf you have a depression youÂ€Â™re often awake all night itÂ€Â™s extremely lonely itÂ€Â™s dark youÂ€Â™re aware every moment that the world around you is sleeping every concern you have is magnified.Â€Âù         The study is the first of four on sleep and depression nearing completion all financed by the  The new report from a team at Ryerson University in Toronto found that 87 percent of patients who resolved their insomnia in four biweekly talk therapy sessions also saw their depression symptoms dissolve after eight weeks of treatment either with an antidepressant drug or a placebo pill Â€Â” almost twice the rate of those who could not shake their insomnia. Those numbers are in line with a previous pilot study of insomnia treatment at Stanford.         In an interview the reportÂ€Â™s lead author  Dr. Carney acknowledged that the study was small Â€Â” just 66 patients Â€Â” and said a clearer picture should emerge as the other teams of scientists released their results. Those studies are being done at Stanford Duke and the University of Pittsburgh and include about 70 subjects each. Dr. Carney will present her data on Saturday at a convention of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies in Nashville.         Doctors have known for years that sleep problems are intertwined with mood disorders. But only recently have they begun to investigate the effects of treating both at the same time. Antidepressant drugs like Prozac help many people as does talk therapy but in rigorous studies the treatments administered individually only slightly outperform placebo pills. Used together the treatments produce a cure rate Â€Â” full recovery Â€Â” for about 40 percent of patients.         Adding insomnia therapy however to an antidepressant would sharply lift the cure rate Dr. CarneyÂ€Â™s data suggests as do the findings from the Stanford pilot study which included 30 people.         Doctors have long considered poor sleep to be a symptom of depression that would clear up with treatments said Rachel Manber a professor in the psychiatry and behavioral sciences department at Stanford whose 2008 pilot trial of insomnia therapy provided the rationale for larger studies. Â€ÂœBut we now know thatÂ€Â™s not the caseÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœThe relationship is bidirectional Â€Â” that insomnia can precede the depression.Â€Âù         Full-blown insomnia is more serious than the sleep problems most people occasionally have. To qualify for a diagnosis people must have endured at least a month of chronic sleep loss that has caused problems at work at home or in important relationships. Several studies now suggest that developing insomnia doubles a personÂ€Â™s risk of later becoming depressed Â€Â” the sleep problem preceding the mood disorder rather than the other way around.        6,1E+14,0,Article,News,Accounts and People of Note in the Advertising Industry,Business Day,777,5.804,5.68,David Adelman executive director of Mindshare New York part of the Mindshare division of GroupM was named Chicago office lead.

New York City and Chicago are considering adding e-cigarettes to their bans on smoking in bars restaurants and parks and Los Angeles is moving to restrict e-cigarette sales even though e-cigarettes donÂ€Â™t generate smoke and while not proved to be entirely safe for users are undoubtedly less hazardous than tobacco cigarettes.         The evidence while still thin suggests that many e-cigarette users hoping to kick the habit use e-cigarettes as a safer alternative to tobacco. Research also suggests that e-cigarettes may be better at helping to sustain smoking cessation than pharmaceutical products like nicotine patches or gums.         No one believes nicotine addiction is a good thing and our qualified support for e-cigarettes is not one we reach lightly. Although some e-cigarette manufacturers have no links to the tobacco industry Big Tobacco is consuming an ever-greater share of the e-cigarette market.Ã‚Â It is hard for public health advocates like us to look favorably on anything the industry wants. But history shows that harm reduction Â€Â” the doctrine that many risks cannot be eradicated and that efforts are best spent on minimizing the resulting harm Â€Â” has had an important place in antismoking efforts and suggests that regulation is better than prohibition.         ItÂ€Â™s been only a half-century since the federal government took an interest in making tobacco products safer. In 1964 Surgeon General Luther L. Terry issued a watershed report definitively linking smoking with lung cancer. But he also described research into new kinds of cigarettes as Â€Âœa promising avenue for further development.Â€Âù In the early 1970s the government spent some $6 million a year to try to develop safer tobacco products. Even the health secretary Joseph A. Califano Jr. who called smoking Â€ÂœPublic Enemy No. 1Â€Âù saw in 1978 a place for Â€Âœresearch aimed at creating a less hazardous cigarette.Â€Âù As late as 1981 the surgeon general advised smokers who couldnÂ€Â™t or wouldnÂ€Â™t quit to switch to low-tar and low-nicotine brands.         The American Cancer Society while worried that the development of less hazardous cigarettes might derail efforts to deter people from smoking or getting them to quit supported Â€Âœfrank scientific discussion about the possibilities of developing cigarettes that will be less harmful and still satisfying to smokers.Â€Âù         This effort came to a halt in the 1980s when stunning revelations from high-profile court cases demonstrated that the tobacco industry had lied about the dangers of smoking for decades and even manipulated the levels of nicotine in its products to ensure that smokers stayed hooked. The magnitude of the deception made it nearly impossible to consider the possibility of a Â€ÂœsaferÂ€Âù tobacco product. It inspired among advocates opposition to anything less than total cessation.         This new stance was supported by the availability of over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapies and a focus on protection of bystanders from secondhand smoke. As the head of the American Heart Association put it in 2000: Â€ÂœThere is no such thing as a safer cigarette.Â€Âù         The irony is that during these same years AIDS prompted public health advocates to support needle exchange for users of intravenous drugs a harm-reduction approach that also drew fire from those who favored complete elimination of drug use. Fears that such programs would lead to greater illicit drug use have been definitively put to rest.         Of course the analogy is not exact: Unlike clean needles which present no independent harms to injecting drug users less risky alternatives to smoking like smokeless chewing tobacco and the moist tobacco product known as snus carry a grave risk: oral cancers.         E-cigarettes potentially overcome that barrier. Most experts consider nicotine harmful only at extremely high doses. Tobacco control advocates tolerate the long-term use of therapies like the nicotine patch and nicotine gum despite their approval only as temporary smoking-cessation aids. In 2000 the chairman of a Public Health Service panel called tobacco dependence a Â€Âœchronic condition that warrants repeated treatmentÂ€Âù even if that meant treating smokers Â€Âœfor the rest of their lives.Â€Âù         Advocates fear that e-cigarettes will serve as a gateway to deadly cigarettes Â€Â” or sustain smokers in public settings where lighting up is banned. Â€ÂœWaiting to actÂ€Âù New York CityÂ€Â™s health commissioner Thomas A. Farley said Â€Âœis a risk we should not take.Â€Âù         But there is a price to such rigidity. Emotion should not rule out harm reduction even if eradication of smoking is the ultimate goal. Banning vaping in public wonÂ€Â™t help. Instead e-cigarettes should be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration as products Â€Âœsold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease.Â€Âù The industry canÂ€Â™t be trusted to provide safer products. The historical mistake was not the pursuit of a safer cigarette but championing that cause with dishonest partners.         If e-cigarettes can reduce even slightly the blight of six million tobacco-related deaths aÃ‚Â year trying to force them out of sight is counterproductive.        186,1E+14,0,Article,News,"Prater, Manning Lead Broncos, 51-28 Over Tennessee",Sports,794,5.117,5.494,"DENVER Â€Â” Peyton Manning and Matt Prater were more about big numbers than the little one Sunday.         As in an NFL-record 64-yard field goal to go along with 39 completions 397 yards passing and of course 51 points.         That the temperature was only 18 degrees at kickoff and only 14 when Prater kicked his way to one of the most iconic records in the game felt more annoying than anything. Same for the opponent Â€Â” the Tennessee Titans who fought gamely for a half before falling 51-28 on Sunday to the Broncos who clinched a playoff berth.         As for all those doubts about Manning's abilities in the cold: ""I won't try to answer it because I didn't give it any validation in the first place"" said the quarterback who is now 4-7 in games where the temperature is 32 or below at kickoff.         The cold certainly didn't bother Prater who lashed his 64-yarder through the icy air on the last play of the first half. Yes it was at altitude in Denver same as two of the four 63-yarders from years past.         ""But I think the 10-degree weather takes out the altitude"" Prater said.         Manning's 39 completions set a team record. His 59 attempts matched a franchise high. His seven games this year with at least four touchdowns are the most in NFL history. He's now in the playoffs for the 13th time which breaks a record for a quarterback that he shared with Brett Favre. Manning led the Broncos (11-2) past the 50-point mark for the third time this year the first time a team has done that since the NFL merger in 1970.         The Broncos ran a whopping 91 plays on offense giving them plenty of chances to eat away at a 21-10 second-quarter deficit.         ""We were doing well at the beginning but they took off like a rocket"" Titans cornerback Alterraun Verner said.         Despite the gaudy numbers Manning and Prater were about the only Broncos clicking on all cylinders on the day coach John Fox rejoined the team and coached from the sideline after missing four games because of heart surgery.         The special teams gave up a 95-yard kickoff return Â€Â” the second return of 90-plus it has allowed in the last two games.         The Titans (5-8) burned the Denver defense a few times early most notably when Ryan Fitzpatrick (13 for 24 172 yards) picked on rookie cornerback Kayvon Webster on the first drive for a 57-yard completion to Justin Hunter that set up the game's first touchdown.         There were about a half-dozen dropped passes and the Broncos had a whale of a time punching the ball in from the 1. They needed 11 snaps from that distance to get two touchdowns and a field goal.         Those struggles turned Prater's record-setting attempt into much more than a theatrical flourish which is what most field goals are for a team that has now put up 515 points through 13 games.         Denver had cut its deficit to 21-17 and a penalty forced Manning to start from his 15 with 52 seconds left in the first half. An 18-yard pass to Demaryius Thomas got the ball near midfield with 7 seconds left. Then Manning completed a quick 7-yarder to Jacob Tamme who went out of bounds with 3 seconds.         On came Prater. With steam pouring from his mouth he lined up on the right hash mark at the Denver 46 just a few steps over from the eye of the Broncos logo. The kick cleared the crossbar with a bit of room to spare and holder Britton Colquitt jumped piggyback onto the kicker to celebrate.         ""I think I just said 'Kick it as hard as you can'"" Colquitt said. ""I didn't want to put that bug in 'Hey this is the record.'""         Prater broke the mark held by four kickers set first in 1970 by Tom Dempsey and most recently matched by David Akers whose kick last season in Green Bay bounced on the crossbar before going over.         Manning led the Broncos on an 80-yard scoring drive to open the third quarter and the Broncos didn't trail again.         And speaking of big numbers: The quarterback's 4522 yards and 45 touchdowns this season remain on pace to break the NFL records of 5476 and 50.         NOTES: The Broncos dedicated the press box to longtime public-relations man Jim Saccomano who is retiring after the season. ... Titans WR Justin Hunter cracked the 100-yard mark for the second time in three weeks finishing with four catches for 115 yards. ... Knowshon Moreno and Wes Welker each reached double digits in touchdowns Sunday and the Broncos became the first team to have four players score 10 or more in a season.         ___         AP NFL website:  ___        "82,1E+14,1,Article,News,Murder Charge in a Shooting on Doorstep,U.S.,642,5.481,5.211,DETROIT Â€Â” After a two-week investigation the prosecutor here charged a white suburban homeowner on Friday with second-degree murder in the killing of an unarmed young black woman. The prosecutor rejected the manÂ€Â™s assertion that he had been acting in self-defense when he opened his front door and fired a shotgun at the woman through a locked screen door striking her in the face.         The man Theodore Paul Wafer who is white and an employee at the Wayne County Airport Authority entered a not-guilty plea during an arraignment on Friday. Mr. Wafer had told the police that he believed the woman was breaking into his home. The prosecutor Kym Worthy said that she found no evidence of an attempted break-in and that the woman Renisha Marie McBride 19 had been knocking on the door.         The shooting has ignited an anguished conversation in this largely black city and beyond about why another unarmed black person has been killed and whether the legal system would call anyone to account. It was the third high-profile racially charged case this year following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida and the recent police shooting of Jonathan Ferrell in North Carolina after he sought help following a car accident.         Ms. Worthy who is the Wayne County prosecutor and who herself is black said Â€ÂœRace is not relevant.Â€Âù She based her decision Â€Âœon the facts and the evidenceÂ€Âù and not on public opinion or mounting comparisons to other cases she said.         Emphasizing that the shooting had not met the provisions of MichiganÂ€Â™s self-defense law Ms. Worthy said Â€ÂœThere is no duty to retreat in your own home.Â€Âù But reading from the state code she said that a person may use deadly force only if Â€Âœthe individual honestly and reasonably believes that the use of deadly force is necessary to prevent the imminent death of or imminent great bodily harm to himself or herself or to another individual.Â€Âù         Some however said that charges were only a start.         Â€ÂœI think people donÂ€Â™t understand that this stuff is happening all the timeÂ€Âù said the Rev. Charles Williams II the Detroit leader of the National Action Network. Â€ÂœWeÂ€Â™re happy we got a charge in this case Â€Â” thatÂ€Â™s progress Â€Â” but this whole situation tells us that there is still work to do when it comes to race in America.Â€Âù         In a courtroom in Dearborn Heights here on Friday afternoon Mr. Wafer 54 stood largely silent. Seeking a bond lower than the $250000 that was ultimately set his lawyer Mack Carpenter told a judge that Mr. Wafer was a longtime Michigan resident who took care of his 81-year-old mother. Mr. Carpenter said Mr. Wafer had the highest possible security clearance at the airport authority where he works. Michigan State Police records show Mr. Wafer has had two driving offenses decades old.         By the end of the day Mr. Wafer had posted bond and was to be released the authorities said. He was placed on administrative leave from his job an official from the airport authority said.         In addition to murder in the second degree Mr. Wafer was charged with manslaughter and a weapons violation connected to using his Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun. The weapon Ms. Worthy said appeared to be legally owned by Mr. Wafer. The charges could carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. His lawyer Mr. Carpenter said he would offer a strong defense.         Members of Ms. McBrideÂ€Â™s family who say they feel certain race played a role in her death are hopeful about the prosecutorÂ€Â™s decision to bring charges.         Â€ÂœRenisha can rest nowÂ€Âù said Bernita Spinks Ms. McBrideÂ€Â™s aunt. Â€ÂœIt shows that nobody can get away with what heÂ€Â™s done.Â€Âù         Civil rights leaders here who had questioned why Mr. Wafer was not arrested immediately after the shooting said that the charges were as serious as they could have anticipated and had come with relative speed.        90,1E+14,1,Article,News,Detroit Ruling on Bankruptcy Lifts Pension Protections,U.S.,669,5.659,5.425,DETROIT Â€Â” In a ruling that could reverberate far beyond Detroit a federal judge held on Tuesday that this battered city could formally enter bankruptcy and asserted that DetroitÂ€Â™s obligation to pay pensions in full was not untouchable.         The judge Steven W. Rhodes dealt a major blow to the widely held belief that state laws preserve public pensions and his ruling is likely to resonate in Chicago Los Angeles Philadelphia and many other American cities where the rising cost of pensions has been crowding out spending for public schools police departments and other services.         The judge made it clear that public employee pensions were not protected in a federal Chapter 9 bankruptcy even though the Michigan Constitution expressly protects them. Â€ÂœPension benefits are a contractual right and are not entitled to any heightened protection in a municipal bankruptcyÂ€Âù he said.         James E. Spiotto a lawyer with the firm Chapman & Cutler in Chicago who specializes in municipal bankruptcy and was not involved in the case said: Â€ÂœNo bankruptcy court had ruled that before. It will be instructive.Â€Âù         For people in Detroit the birthplace of the Motown sound and of the American auto industry Judge RhodesÂ€Â™s decision that the city qualified for bankruptcy amounted to one more miserable if expected assessment of its woeful circumstances. The city has lost hundreds of thousands of residents the judge said only a third of its ambulances function and its Police Department closes less than 9 percent of cases.         Â€ÂœThis once proud and prosperous city canÂ€Â™t pay its debtsÂ€Âù said the judge who sits in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s insolvent. ItÂ€Â™s eligible for bankruptcy. But it also has an opportunity for a fresh start.Â€Âù         Appeals were expected to be filed quickly. At least one union filed a notice of appeal on Tuesday and other unions and pension fund representatives said they were considering contesting the outcome as well. But the ruling also allows Kevyn D. Orr an emergency manager assigned in March by the state to oversee DetroitÂ€Â™s finances to proceed swiftly with a formal plan for starting over Â€Â” a proposal to pay off only a portion of its $18 billion in debts and to restore essential services like streetlights to tolerable levels.         Mr. Orr said he intended to file the formal blueprint known as a Â€Âœplan of adjustmentÂ€Âù by the first week of 2014. That plan could include efforts to spin off city departments to outside entities to sell city assets and to reinvest in failing city services. Mr. Orr has said his goal is to bring Detroit the nationÂ€Â™s largest city ever to find itself in bankruptcy out of the court process by next fall.         Â€ÂœWe have some heavy work ahead of usÂ€Âù Mr. Orr said Tuesday.         Around Detroit leaders sounded somber but mildly hopeful tones. Mayor-elect Mike Duggan said that Tuesday was a day no one wanted to see but that the city now needed to move forward. And Dave Bing the departing mayor whose tenure in office has been consumed by the financial distress said it was inevitable that Detroit would ultimately be found insolvent. Â€ÂœWe are now starting from Square 1Â€Âù he said.         Municipal workers and retirees said they were shaken by the developments and unsure what to expect. Any cut to pensions many said would be crushing.         Â€ÂœThe impact of this is going to be catastrophic on families like mine on fixed incomeÂ€Âù said Brendan Milewski 34 a Detroit firefighter who was seriously injured in an arson in 2010 and said he received a pension of $2800 a month from the city. Â€ÂœRetirees are going to be put out of house and home. TheyÂ€Â™re not going to be able to afford a car food or medicine.Â€Âù         Bruce Babiarz a spokesman for the Detroit Police and Fire Retirement System was blunt in his assessment. Â€ÂœThis is one of the strongest protected pension obligations in the country here in MichiganÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœIf this ruling is upheld this is the canary in a coal mine for protected pension benefits across the country. TheyÂ€Â™re gone.Â€Âù        93,1E+14,0,Article,News,"In Shepherding Detroit Bankruptcy, Lawyer Tackles a Job He Didnâ€™t Ask For",U.S.,1438,5.346,5.381,DETROIT Â€Â” Kevyn D.

And the circumstances were certain to be volatile in a city that was hardly asking for an outsider to step in. Ultimately Mr. Orr said he became convinced that it was a call to action.         In the nearly nine months since Mr. Orr has been continually on the move meeting with community groups issuing reports filing for bankruptcy firing and hiring people at City Hall.

Canaanite palace in northern Israel archaeologists struck wine.         Near the banquet hall where rulers of a Middle Bronze Age city-state and their guests feasted a team of American and Israeli researchers broke through to a storage room holding the remains of 40 large ceramic jars. The vessels were broken their liquid contents long since vanished Â€Â” but not without a trace.         A chemical analysis of residues left in the three-foot-tall jars detected traces of organic acids that are common components of all wine as well as ingredients popular in ancient winemaking. These included honey mint cinnamon bark juniper berries and resins used as a preservative. The recipe was similar to medicinal wines used for 2000 years in ancient Egypt and probably tasted something like retsina or other resinous Greek wines today.         So the archaeologists who have been exploring the Canaanite site known as Tel Kabri announced on Friday that they had found one of civilizationÂ€Â™s oldest and largest wine cellars. The storage room held the equivalent of about 3000 bottles of red and white wines they said Â€Â” and they suspected that this was not the palaceÂ€Â™s only wine cellar.         Â€ÂœThis is a hugely significant discoveryÂ€Âù said Eric H. Cline a co-director of the Tel Kabri excavations in a statement issued by George Washington University where he is chairman of the department of classical and Near Eastern languages and civilizations. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s a wine cellar that to our knowledge is largely unmatched in its age and size.Â€Âù         Dr. Cline and the other co-director Assaf Yasur-Landau of the University of Haifa in Israel described their findings Friday in Baltimore at the annual meeting of the  The archaeologists said that much of the palace including the banquet hall and the wine storage room was destroyed 3600 years ago in some violent event perhaps an earthquake. The wine cellar was covered with thick debris of mud bricks and plaster. That and the fact that no subsequent buildings were erected on top of the site have made Tel Kabri an inviting place for archaeological studies.         Team members said some older discoveries had been made before in tombs but nothing on the scale of Tel Kabri. Patrick McGovern of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania said he had Â€Âœreservations about a finding for which a detailed scientific report has not been published.Â€Âù He said in an email that Â€Âœthe oldest chemically confirmed Â€Â˜wine cellarsÂ€Â™ are those in the tomb Scorpion I of EgyptÂ€Âù about 3150 B.C.         Â€ÂœIf we are making the claim only for ancient Canaan and put the emphasis on Â€Â˜palatial' Â€Âù Dr. McGovern suggested Â€Âœthe Kabri might well be the earliest.Â€Âù         Dr. McGovern and other researchers have been able to re-create ancient wines and beers from the dregs from long-ago tastings. Dr. Koh said his group expected to produce a reasonable facsimile of the 1700 B.C. vintage favored by the palace elite in the land of Canaan.         In the Middle Bronze Age from 2000 to 1550 B.C. Canaan was a confederation of city-states the most important of which seems to have been Hazor in a region that included what today is Israel Lebanon northwestern Jordan and parts of western Syria. At the time Canaanites were farmers merchants and early seafarers to Cyprus and the Aegean Islands. These were the centuries preceding the appearance of the biblical Hebrews. In the biblical narrative God promised Canaan as a gift to Abraham; some modern scholars have stirred controversy suggesting that the early Israelites were in fact themselves Canaanites.         As for the ancient beverage the presence of tartaric acid was Â€Âœa surefire markerÂ€Âù of grape juice or wine Dr. Koh said in a teleconference briefing with reporters on Thursday. Other recognized ingredients were consistent with winemaking recipes in ancient texts from the ruins of Mari an early city on the Euphrates River in what is now Syria.         Â€ÂœThey wrote about the recipesÂ€Âù Dr. Cline said referring to the Mari texts. Â€ÂœHere for the first time we believed we have these crafted wines that verified the recipes beyond shadow of doubt.Â€Âù         Thirty-eight of the 40 vessels contained recognizable wine residues. Â€ÂœThis wasnÂ€Â™t moonshine that someone was brewing in their basement eyeballing the measurementsÂ€Âù Dr. Koh noted. Â€ÂœThis wineÂ€Â™s recipe was strictly followed in each and every jar.Â€Âù         The current excavations began in 2005. Four years later archaeologists uncovered spectacular frescoes from the Aegean Islands and last year they found the banquet hall. This July they started finding one after another of the ceramic jugs in the 15-by-25-foot storage room. Support for the project was provided by the National Geographic Society the Israel Science Foundation the Institute for Aegean Prehistory the Bronfman Philanthropies George Washington University Haifa University and private donations.         More discoveries may be in the offing. Just days before the archaeologists wrapped up this summerÂ€Â™s work they came upon two doors leading out of the wine cellar where they had been digging one to the south and one to the west. They will have to wait until the next excavation season in 2015 to find out if the doors lead to additional storage rooms possibly with more wine that the Canaanite connoisseurs of the grape never got to swoon over at their goat-meat banquets.        33,1E+14,0,Article,News,Brees and Saints Break Up Panthersâ€™ Winning Streak,Sports,801,5.282,5.46,Drew Brees passed for 313 yards and 4 touchdowns as the  The PanthersÂ€Â™ defense had not allowed more than two touchdowns in a game this season until the Saints scored three in the second quarter alone.

Rolling with the Jets has been a dangerous proposition these last three weeks what with their being outscored by 59 points in a string of defeats that not only ushered them from A.F.C. wild-card front-runner to onlooker but increased speculation that Ryan could be entering his final four games as the coach.

Geno Smith engineered six scoring drives on Sunday committed only one turnover and heeded his coachesÂ€Â™ advice to play more intuitively a directive he interpreted perhaps a little too literally when he risked injury by lowering his shoulder to invite contact instead of veering out of bounds at the end of a 32-yard run in the fourth quarter.         Â€ÂœI canÂ€Â™t explain whyÂ€Âù Smith said. Â€ÂœIt was kind of instinct. I think part of it was me trying to send a message to my teammates to everyone that IÂ€Â™m their quarterback.Â€Âù         So he is. Smith threw for 219 yards and ran for 50 more benefiting from the returns of Jeremy Kerley (four catches for 41 yards and a touchdown) and Santonio Holmes (three for 55 yards) and the increased presence of Kellen Winslow (three for 61). He overcame a shaky first few series to deliver his best performance in two months backing up sentiments expressed all week.         Ryan bragged about how on Wednesday the offense had had its best practice of the season. Did that include Smith? Absolutely said Ryan who on Sunday called SmithÂ€Â™s outing Â€Âœexcellent.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœI think the difference was just eliminating the indecision in my gameÂ€Âù Smith said.         Ryan also pleaded for the JetsÂ€Â™ offense which had scored 20 points across the last three games to be judged starting Sunday when Holmes and Kerley played together for the first time since Week 4. That request seemed reasonable. It also invited the possibility of their biggest failure yet.         For a team that ranks at or near the bottom in most statistical categories and has a quarterback who had not thrown a touchdown pass since Oct. 20 improvement is measured incrementally. With an opening drive for instance that netted more yards (57) than were gained in the entire first half last week (39). Or with a first quarter that featured more points (10) than the Jets scored in their past two weeks combined (6).        40,1E+14,0,Article,News,Young Jets Safety Emulates Veteran Teammate With Pivotal Play,Sports,746,5.258,5.713,EAST RUTHERFORD N.J. Â€Â” The genesis of Antonio AllenÂ€Â™s blocked punt and touchdown in the second quarter Sunday can be traced back to last Monday when the JetsÂ€Â™ special-teams coordinator Ben Kotwica told Allen to line up just off the center rather than off the edge.         Allen did not really know why. He said Kotwica had noticed something with OaklandÂ€Â™s long snapper or maybe it was the tackle.         Fighting for playing time trying to establish himself as a playmaker Allen was not about to question the move.         Newly positioned he burst through the middle of the line so smoothly it was as if he were being hoisted by pulleys. He could have blocked Marquette KingÂ€Â™s punt with his sternum.         Â€ÂœHe put me in the perfect place to make the playÂ€Âù Allen said of Kotwica.         Allen fell on the ball in the end zone and braced himself for a pileup. But there was not a Raiders player within 10 yards.         Â€ÂœIt felt weird Â€Â” they just let me looseÂ€Âù Allen said. Â€ÂœI was surprised. I thought that the tackle was going to give me some kind of push but he didnÂ€Â™t even touch me. He just let me go right through.Â€Âù         The score gave the Jets a 20-3 lead with 3 minutes 55 seconds left in the half.         They were not exactly struggling to move the ball but with the inconsistency of the offense this season and their difficulties stopping Oakland the early cushion was welcomed.         Â€ÂœSometimes you need special teams to pick up the defenseÂ€Âù Coach Rex Ryan said. Â€ÂœThatÂ€Â™s the mark of a team.Â€Âù         On the sideline Ed Reed congratulated Allen a fellow safety on his play a game-changing score that might have reminded Reed a little bit of himself.         An interesting dynamic has developed between the two players Â€Â” one at the beginning of his career the other in his professional twilight Â€Â” since Reed arrived four weeks earlier and supplanted Allen in the starting lineup.         At the time it was viewed as a deferential move to a nine-time Pro Bowl selection and the N.F.L.Â€Â™s active leader in interceptions with 62. The Jets hoped Reed 35 would find comfort in RyanÂ€Â™s system and turn back the clock to their days together in Baltimore.         Of course things did not exactly go that way and ReedÂ€Â™s quiet first three games with the Jets opened him up to criticism. Questions were raised about his age and ability and some wondered what role would be left for Allen.         Allen 25 and in his second season wondered a bit about that himself. He said Sunday that he had been satisfied with his performance and progress for the first nine games of the season before Reed arrived.         Â€ÂœI thought I was having a pretty productive seasonÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœI was thinking coming into the season this was going to be my breakout year.Â€Âù         But what could have been a combative relationship has instead become a congenial one. Allen said he had benefited from ReedÂ€Â™s arrival and his mentorship on the practice field and in the locker room.         Â€ÂœHe gives me little tips to pick up onÂ€Âù Allen said. Â€ÂœI try to follow him.Â€Âù         And so there Allen had been on the sideline congratulating Reed after his first interception of the season which set the Jets up for a field goal on the series just before AllenÂ€Â™s blocked punt.         Â€ÂœNobodyÂ€Â™s perfect playing this gameÂ€Âù Reed said. Â€ÂœI welcome anybody who wants to watch film with me. ThereÂ€Â™s a reason why IÂ€Â™m on this side of the fence.Â€Âù         Reed remained the starter Sunday but Allen generally played on third downs and when OaklandÂ€Â™s mobile quarterback Terrell Pryor was in the game. Reed also appeared to have injured his right knee on a miscommunication with cornerback Antonio Cromartie a midfield collision that resulted in a 48-yard Raiders touchdown. But he stayed in the game.         Â€ÂœEd had a nice pick and did a nice job of communicating thingsÂ€Âù Ryan said. Â€ÂœWeÂ€Â™re trying to take advantage of the talent that we have. We knew it would be a physical game so we tried to put some of the youngsters in there to take some of the heat.Â€Âù         Afterward one of those young players seemed like the happiest in the locker room.         Â€ÂœIt feels good to make a play on special teamsÂ€Âù Allen said. Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™ve been trying to make plays with whatever happens with my playing time. ItÂ€Â™s big for me and big for the team.Â€Âù        83,1E+14,0,Article,Obituary (Obit),"Edouard Molinaro, French Film Director, Dies at 85",Arts,533,5.484,5.822,Edouard Molinaro who received an Oscar nomination for directing the 1978 French film  His death was confirmed in a statement by President FranÃƒÂ§ois Hollande of France.         Mr. Molinaro was a successful screenwriter and director with credits for many French films and television shows but he is best known for Â€ÂœCageÂ€Âù which at the time was the highest-grossing foreign-language film ever in the United States.         The film is about a gay couple Renato and Albin who run a nightclub in the South of France that features drag shows. When RenatoÂ€Â™s son gets engaged and brings his girlfriendÂ€Â™s conservative parents to meet them Renato and Albin (a drag star) pretend to be husband and wife.         Mr. Molinaro said he wanted to make a comedy with gay characters because they had previously been represented only in dramas. He hoped the audience would Â€Âœlaugh with not at homosexuals Â€Â” the way one would with other peopleÂ€Âù he told  President Hollande praised Mr. Molinaro for working with some of the best French actors and having a rich and varied career.         Â€ÂœOur country lost a great appealing and original filmmakerÂ€Âù Mr. Hollande said in a statement.         Mr. Molinaro was born in Bordeaux France on May 31 1928. He started out making crime films and went on to direct Â€ÂœOscarÂ€Âù in 1967 with Louis de FunÃƒÂ¨s a popular French comedian and Â€ÂœMy Uncle BenjaminÂ€Âù in 1969. Among the stars he worked with were Brigitte Bardot Jeanne Moreau and Catherine Deneuve.         The screenplay for Â€ÂœCageÂ€Âù was adapted from a play by Jean Poiret and written by Mr. Poiret Mr. Molinaro and others.         In New York the film ran for 19 months at the 68th Street Playhouse on the Upper East Side. The theaterÂ€Â™s owner Meyer Ackerman said it drew a diverse audience: men and women gay and straight young and old.         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s gentle and human and compassionate in its spoofingÂ€Âù Mr. Ackerman told The New York Times in 1980. Â€ÂœIt offended no one.Â€Âù         Some critics however argued that it relied too heavily on stereotypes.

When Mr. Molinaro saw his film Â€ÂœCageÂ€Âù for the first time he thought it was so bad that it might be his last job.

On Monday the companies led by  It is the broadest and strongest effort by the companies often archrivals to speak with one voice to pressure the government. The tech industry whose billionaire founders and executives are highly sought as political donors forms a powerful interest group that is increasingly flexing its muscle in Washington.         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s now in their business and economic interest to protect their usersÂ€Â™ privacy and to aggressively push for changesÂ€Âù said Trevor Timm an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Â€ÂœThe N.S.A. mass-surveillance programs exist for a simple reason: cooperation with the tech and telecom companies. If the tech companies no longer want to cooperate they have a lot of leverage to force significant reform.Â€Âù         The political push by the technology companies opens a third front in their battle against government surveillance which has escalated with recent revelations about government spying without the companiesÂ€Â™ knowledge. The companies have also been  Â€ÂœPeople wonÂ€Â™t use technology they donÂ€Â™t trustÂ€Âù Brad Smith MicrosoftÂ€Â™s general counsel said in a statement. Â€ÂœGovernments have put this trust at risk and governments need to help restore it.Â€Âù          The Obama administration has already begun a review of N.S.A. procedures in reaction to public outrage. The results of that review could be presented to the White House as soon as this week.         Â€ÂœHaving done an independent review and brought in a whole bunch of folks Â€Â” civil libertarians and lawyers and others Â€Â” to examine whatÂ€Â™s being done IÂ€Â™ll be proposing some self-restraint on the N.S.A. and you know to initiate some reforms that can give people more confidenceÂ€Âù Mr. Obama said Thursday on the MSNBC program Â€ÂœHardball.Â€Âù         While the Internet companies fight to maintain authority over their customersÂ€Â™ data their business models depend on collecting the same information that the spy agencies want and they have long cooperated with the government to some extent by handing over data in response to legal requests.         The new principles outlined by the companies contain little information and few promises about their own practices which privacy advocates say contribute to the governmentÂ€Â™s desire to tap into the companiesÂ€Â™ data systems.         Â€ÂœThe companies are placing their users at risk by collecting and retaining so much informationÂ€Âù said Marc Rotenberg president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center a nonprofit research and advocacy organization. Â€ÂœAs long as this much personal data is collected and kept by these companies they are always going to be the target of government collection efforts.Â€Âù         For instance Internet companies store email messages search queries payment details and other personal information to provide online services and show personalized ads.         They are trying to blunt the spying revelationsÂ€Â™ effects on their businesses. Each disclosure risks alienating users and foreign governments are considering laws that would discourage their citizens from using services from American Internet companies. The cloud computing industry could lose $180 billion or a quarter of its revenue by 2016 according to Forrester Research.         Telecom companies which were not included in the proposal to Congress have had a closer working relationship with the government than the Internet companies such as longstanding partnerships to hand over customer information. While the Internet companies have published so-called transparency reports about government requests for example the telecoms have not.         Â€ÂœFor the phone companiesÂ€Âù said Tim Wu a professor at Columbia studying the Internet and the law Â€Âœhelp with federal spying is a longstanding tradition with roots in the Cold War. ItÂ€Â™s another area where thereÂ€Â™s a split between old tech and new tech Â€Â” the latter taking a much more libertarian position.Â€Âù         The new surveillance principles the Internet companies said should include limiting governmentsÂ€Â™ authority to collect usersÂ€Â™ information setting up a legal system of oversight and accountability for that authority allowing the companies to publish the number and nature of the demands for data ensuring that usersÂ€Â™ online data can be stored in different countries and establishing a framework to govern data requests between countries.         In a statement Larry Page GoogleÂ€Â™s co-founder and chief executive criticized governments for the Â€Âœapparent wholesale collection of data in secret and without independent oversight.Â€Âù He added Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s time for reform and we urge the U.S. government to lead the way.Â€Âù         In their open letter the companies maintain they are fighting for their customersÂ€Â™ privacy. Â€ÂœWe are focused on keeping usersÂ€Â™ data secureÂ€Âù the letter said Â€Âœdeploying the latest encryption technology to prevent unauthorized surveillance on our networks and by pushing back on government requests to ensure that they are legal and reasonable in scope.Â€Âù         The global principles outlined by the companies make no specific mention of any country and call on Â€Âœthe worldÂ€Â™s governments to address the practices and laws regulating government surveillance of individuals and access to their information.Â€Âù But the open letter to American officials specifically cites the United States Constitution as the guidepost for new restrictions on government surveillance.         Chief among the companiesÂ€Â™ proposals is a demand to write Â€Âœsensible limitationsÂ€Âù on the ability of government agencies to compel Internet companies to disclose user data forbidding the wholesale vacuuming of user information.         Â€ÂœGovernments should limit surveillance to specific known users for lawful purposes and should not undertake bulk data collection of Internet communicationsÂ€Âù the companies said.        113,1E+14,1,Article,Editorial,The Shame of American Health Care,Opinion,441,5.788,5.342,Even as Americans struggle with the changes required by health care reform  The report found that by virtually all measures of cost access to care and ease of dealing with insurance problems Americans fared poorly compared with people in other advanced countries. The survey covered 20000 adults in the United States and 10 other industrial nations Â€Â” Australia Canada France Germany the Netherlands New Zealand Norway Sweden Switzerland and Britain all of which put in place universal or near-universal health coverage decades ago. The United States spends far more than any of these countries on a per capita basis and as a percent of the national economy.         For that it gets meager results. Some 37 percent of American adults went without recommended care did not see a doctor when sick or failed to fill prescriptions in the past year because of costs compared with 4 percent in Britain and 6 percent in Sweden. Nearly a quarter of American adults could not pay medical bills or had serious problems paying them compared with less than 13 percent in France and 7 percent or less in five other countries. Even Americans who were insured for the entire year were more likely than adults abroad to forgo care because of costs an indication of how skimpy some insurance policies are.         When Americans got sick they had to wait longer than people in most of the other countries to get help. Fewer than half were able to get same-day or next-day appointments with a doctor or nurse; one in four had to wait six days or longer. (Only Canada fared worse on both counts.) But Americans got quicker access to specialists than adults in all but two other countries.         The complexity of the American insurance system is also an issue. Some 32 percent of consumers spent a lot of time on insurance paperwork or in disputes with their insurer over denials of payment for services they thought were covered.         The Affordable Care Act was created to address these problems by covering tens of millions of uninsured people and providing subsidies to help many of them pay for policies; by setting limits on the out-of-pocket costs that patients must bear; and by requiring that all policies cover specified benefits.         Americans are understandably frustrated with the Obama administrationÂ€Â™s failure to produce a functioning website. President ObamaÂ€Â™s erroneous statements that all people who like their current insurance policies can keep them Â€Â” not true for many people buying insurance in the individual market Â€Â” has added to anger and misunderstanding. The reform law however imperfect is needed to bring the dysfunctional American health care system up to levels already achieved in other advanced nations.        99,1E+14,0,Article,News,Crisis for Insane Clown Posse: Getting Saner,Arts,1313,5.675,5.724,FARMINGTON HILLS Mich. Â€Â” For more than 20 years the rap duo  A few days ago Insane Clown Posse a pioneering act in a rap genre called horrorcore was approached by Fuse the music-oriented cable channel to record its commentary for a roundup of supposedly shocking music videos. Though the rappers have enjoyed their increasing visibility on Fuse (where a second season of their television series  Â€ÂœHow are we going to sit there and talk about how shocking Maroon 5 is?Â€Âù asked Joseph Utsler an Insane Clown Posse co-founder who goes by the stage name Shaggy 2 Dope.         His musical partner Joseph Bruce known as Violent J added: Â€ÂœWe had to do it I.C.P.-style or it would have looked bad for us.Â€Âù         The bandÂ€Â™s solution was to mock the performers that Fuse had asked them to discuss. (Â€ÂœJustin Bieber started off as a teeny-bop child artistÂ€Âù explained Violent J. Â€ÂœNow heÂ€Â™s a teeny-bop child artist with tattoos. Shocking!Â€Âù) But even as performers who wear the face paint of grinning harlequins and burnish their outsider status the duo understand that something looks very strange about this arrangement.         The past year has been particularly trying for Insane Clown Posse which with an attitude that mixes silliness and over-the-top aggression has built a worshipful cadre of fans known as Juggalos.         On one front the band is waging a legal battle against the Federal Bureau of Investigation whose National Gang Intelligence Center listed Juggalos as Â€Âœa loosely organized hybrid gangÂ€Âù  Lately Violent J said he has been seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication to help him cope with the persistent feeling that he can never turn off the pressures of work.

They are plain-spoken but always conscious of how their choices will affect perceptions; they seek opportunities that will portray them in the right light but understand that in a social-media era they cannot afford to pass up any exposure.

They tried to nullify entire federal agencies by denying them leaders. They abused Senate rules past the point of tolerance or responsibility. And so they were left enraged and threatening revenge on Thursday when a majority did the only logical thing and stripped away their power to block the presidentÂ€Â™s nominees.          The only exceptions are nominations to the Supreme Court for which a filibuster would still be allowed. But now that the Senate has begun to tear down undemocratic procedures the precedent set on Thursday will increase the pressure to end those filibusters too.         This vote was long overdue. Â€ÂœI have waited 18 years for this momentÂ€Âù said Senator Tom Harkin Democrat of Iowa.         It would have been unthinkable just a few months ago when the majority leader Harry Reid was still holding out hope for a long-lasting deal with Republicans and insisting that federal judges because of their lifetime appointments should still be subject to supermajority thresholds. But Mr. Reid along with all but three Senate Democrats was pushed to act by the RepublicansÂ€Â™ refusal to allow any appointments to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit just because they wanted to keep a conservative majority on that important court.         That move was as outrageous as the tactic they used earlier this year to try to cripple the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (which they despise) by blocking all appointments to those agencies. That obstruction was removed in July when Mr. Reid threatened to end the filibuster and Republicans backed down. The recent blockade of judges to the D.C. appellate court was the last straw.         Republicans warned that the rule change could haunt the Democrats if they lost the White House and the Senate. But the Constitution gives presidents the right to nominate top officials in their administration and name judges and it says nothing about the ability of a Senate minority to stop them. (The practice barely existed before the 1970s.) From now on voters will have to understand that presidents are likely to get their way on nominations if their party controls the Senate.         Given the extreme degree of Republican obstruction during the Obama administration the Democrats had little choice but to change the filibuster rule. As Mr. Reid noted on the floor half of all filibusters waged against nominations in Senate history have occurred since Mr. Obama was elected. Twenty of his district court nominees were filibustered; only three such filibusters took place before he took office. There has also been a record-setting amount of delay in approving the presidentÂ€Â™s choices for cabinet positions and federal agency posts even when no objections have been raised about a nomineeÂ€Â™s qualifications.         The rule change does not end the 60-vote threshold for blocking legislation which we have argued is worth preserving. But the vote may lead to broader filibuster changes.  Democrats made the filibuster change with a simple-majority vote which Republicans insisted was a violation of the rules. There is ample precedent for this kind of change though it should be used judiciously. TodayÂ€Â™s vote was an appropriate use of that power and it was necessary to turn the Senate back into a functioning legislative body.        43,1E+14,1,Article,Op-Ed,Art Makes You Smart,Opinion,667,5.92,5.915,FOR many education advocates the arts are a panacea: They supposedly increase test scores generate social responsibility and turn around failing schools. Most of the supporting evidence though does little more than establish correlations between exposure to the arts and certain outcomes. Research that demonstrates a causal relationship has been virtually nonexistent.         A few years ago however we had a rare opportunity to explore such relationships when the  Students who by lottery were selected to visit the museum on a field trip demonstrated stronger critical thinking skills displayed higher levels of social tolerance exhibited greater historical empathy and developed a taste for art museums and cultural institutions.         Crystal Bridges which opened in November 2011 was founded by Alice Walton the daughter of Sam Walton the founder of Walmart. It is impressive with 50000 square feet of gallery space and an endowment of more than $800 million.         Thanks to a generous private gift the museum has a program that allows school groups to visit at no cost to students or schools.         Before the opening we were contacted by the museumÂ€Â™s education department. They recognized that the opening of a major museum in an area that had never had one before was an unusual event that ought to be studied. But they also had a problem. Because the school tours were being offered free in an area where most children had very little prior exposure to cultural institutions demand for visits far exceeded available slots. In the first year alone the museum received applications from 525 school groups requesting tours for more than 38000 students.         As social scientists we knew exactly how to solve this problem. We partnered with the museum and conducted a lottery to fill the available slots. By randomly assigning school tours we were able to allocate spots fairly. Doing so also created a natural experiment to study the  Over the course of the following year nearly 11000 students and almost 500 teachers participated in our study roughly half of whom had been selected by lottery to visit the museum. Applicant groups who won the lottery constituted our treatment group while those who did not win an immediate tour served as our control group.         Several weeks after the students in the treatment group visited the museum we administered surveys to all of the students. The surveys included multiple items that assessed knowledge about art as well as measures of tolerance historical empathy and sustained interest in visiting art museums and other cultural institutions. We also asked them to write an essay in response to a work of art that was unfamiliar to them.         These essays were then coded using a critical-thinking-skills assessment program developed by researchers working with the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.         Further we directly measured whether students are more likely to return to Crystal Bridges as a result of going on a school tour. Students who participated in the study were given a coupon that gave them and their families free entry to a special exhibit at the museum. The coupons were coded so that we could determine the group to which students belonged. Students in the treatment group were 18 percent more likely to attend the exhibit than students in the control group.         Moreover most of the benefits we observed are significantly larger for minority students low-income students and students from rural schools Â€Â” typically two to three times larger than for white middle-class suburban students Â€Â” owing perhaps to the fact that the tour was the first time they had visited an art museum.         Further research is needed to determine what exactly about the museum-going experience determines the strength of the outcomes. How important is the structure of the tour? The size of the group? The type of art presented?         Clearly however we can conclude that visiting an art museum exposes students to a diversity of ideas that challenge them with different perspectives on the human condition. Expanding access to art whether through programs in schools or through visits to area museums and galleries should be a central part of any schoolÂ€Â™s curriculum.        41,1E+14,1,Article,News,Addiction Treatment With a Dark Side,Health,5281,5.95,5.246,For Shawn Schneider a carpenter and rock musician the descent into addiction began one Wisconsin winter with a fall from a rooftop construction site onto the frozen ground below.

The friend Shawn Verrill was sentenced this summer to 71 months in prison.         Â€ÂœI didnÂ€Â™t know you could overdose on SuboxoneÂ€Âù Mr. Verrill said in an interview at a federal prison in Otisville N.Y. Â€ÂœWe were just a bunch of friends getting high and hanging out doing what 20-year-olds do. Then we went to sleep and Miles never woke up.Â€Âù         Suboxone is the blockbuster drug most people have never heard of. Surpassing well-known medications like  But more than a decade after Suboxone went on the market and with the Affordable Care Act poised to bring many more addicts into treatment the high hopes have been tempered by a messy reality. Buprenorphine has become both medication and dope: a treatment with considerable successes and also failures as well as a street and prison drug bedeviling local authorities. It has attracted unscrupulous doctors and caused more health complications and deaths than its advocates acknowledge.         It has also become a lucrative commodity creating moneymaking opportunities Â€Â” for manufacturers doctors drug dealers and even patients Â€Â” that have undermined a public health innovation meant for social good. And the drugÂ€Â™s problems have emboldened some insurers to limit coverage of the medication which cost state  Intended as a long-term treatment for people addicted to opioids Â€Â” heroin as well as painkillers Â€Â” buprenorphine like methadone is an opioid itself that can produce euphoria and cause dependency. Its effects are milder however and they plateau making overdoses less likely and less deadly. And unlike methadone buprenorphine (pronounced byoo-pruh-NOR-feen) is available to addicts by prescription though only from federally authorized doctors with restricted patient loads.         Partly because of these restrictions a volatile subculture has arisen with cash-only buprenorphine clinics feeding a thriving underground market that caters to addicts who buy it to stave off withdrawal or treat themselves because they cannot find or afford a doctor; to recreational users who report a potent durable buzz; and to inmates who see it as Â€Âœprison heroinÂ€Âù and especially in a new dissolvable filmstrip form as ideal contraband.         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s such a thin strip theyÂ€Â™ll put it in the Holy Bible let it melt and eat a page right out of the good bookÂ€Âù said Ken Mobley a jailer in Whitley County Ky. who randomly screened 50 inmates recently and found 21 positive for Suboxone.         Many buprenorphine doctors are addiction experts capable they say of treating far more than the federal limit of 100 patients. But because of that limit an unmet demand for treatment has created a commercial opportunity for prescribers attracting some with histories of overprescribing the very pain pills that made their patients into addicts.         A relatively high proportion of buprenorphine doctors have troubled records a Times examination of the federal Â€Âœbuprenorphine physician locatorÂ€Âù found. In West Virginia one hub of the opioid epidemic the doctors listed are five times as likely to have been disciplined as doctors in general; in Maine another center they are 14 times as likely.         Nationally at least 1350 of 12780 buprenorphine doctors have been sanctioned for offenses that include excessive narcotics prescribing insurance fraud sexual misconduct and practicing medicine while impaired. Some have been suspended or arrested leaving patients in the lurch.         Statistics released in the last year show sharp increases in buprenorphine  BuprenorphineÂ€Â™s staunchest proponents see these indicators as a byproduct of the drugÂ€Â™s rising circulation and emphasize its safety relative to other opioids.         Â€ÂœThe benefits are high the risk is low and it is worth it on a population-wide basisÂ€Âù said Dr. Stuart Gitlow the president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.         But Dr. Robert Newman a leading advocate of methadone treatment said Â€ÂœThe safety factor should not be oversold.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœIt is diverted and sold on the black marketÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœIt is misused and it does lead to medically adverse consequences including death. It is associated with a large number of deaths.Â€Âù         The addiction drug was a Â€Âœprimary suspectÂ€Âù in 420 deaths in the United States reported to the Food and Drug Administration since it reached the market in 2003 according to a Times analysis of federal data.         But buprenorphine is not being monitored systematically enough to gauge the full scope of its misuse some experts say. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not track buprenorphine deaths most medical examiners do not routinely test for it and neither do most emergency rooms prisons jails and drug courts.         Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™ve been studying the emergence of potential drug problems in this country for over 30 yearsÂ€Âù said Eric Wish the director of the Center for Substance Abuse Research at the University of Maryland. Â€ÂœThis is the first drug that nobody seems to want to know about as a potential problem.Â€Âù         The government has a vested interest in its success.         The treatment is the fruit of an extraordinary public-private partnership between a British company and the American government which financed clinical trials and awarded protection from competition after the drugÂ€Â™s patent expired.         The company now a consumer goods giant called  In an 11th-hour bid to thwart generic competition and dominate the market with its patent-protected Suboxone filmstrip the company sought to convince regulators that the tablet form which earned it billions of dollars now presented a deadly risk to children as packaged in pill bottles.         The F.D.A. did not agree. Early this year it approved generic tablets and asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate potentially anticompetitive business practices by the company.         Reckitt Benckiser defended its advocacy for the Suboxone filmstrip Â€Â” now its only pharmaceutical product Â€Â” saying its research showed that the film was safer than the tablets kept addicts in treatment longer and had less of a street presence. It added that it was overseeing an F.D.A.-required Â€Âœrisk evaluation and mitigation strategy to promote the appropriate use of buprenorphine with the goal to minimize the misuse abuse and multidose unintentional exposure of these products.Â€Âù         Dr. John Mendelson of San Francisco a consultant for the company said it could be proud of its management of a difficult product. Â€ÂœTheir biggest success so farÂ€Âù he said Â€Âœis that the whole system has not imploded that enough doctors have prescribed the drug appropriately that there has been no move to withdraw it from the market.Â€Âù         Ronni Katz a health official in Portland Me. is less impressed.         Â€ÂœI remember the early days when we met with the pharma rep in the area Â€Â” I donÂ€Â™t think he was trying to mislead us Â€Â” he truly believed it was a miracle drugÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœBut they way underestimated the potential for abuse which means to me they really donÂ€Â™t understand addiction.Â€Âù         Nearly a half-century ago buprenorphine was born in the laboratory of an English company specializing in mustard and shoe polish where chemists were competing to invent a less addictive painkiller.         Â€ÂœWe were trying to beat morphine not methadoneÂ€Âù said John W. Lewis 81 who oversaw the drugÂ€Â™s development.         Though far more potent than morphine buprenorphine appeared in animal tests to be unusually safe even in very high doses. In 1971 Dr. Lewis and colleagues traveled to an infirmary in Glasgow to conduct the first human tests Â€Â” on themselves.         Buprenorphine made Dr. Lewis violently ill. Â€ÂœIt quite took the edge off our stay in a splendid hotel on the banks of Loch LomondÂ€Âù he said in a speech and it exposed the painkillerÂ€Â™s Â€ÂœAchillesÂ€Â™ heelÂ€Âù Â€Â” Â€Âœthe rather high incidence of  In the mid-1970s Dr. Lewis began shipping the drug to the United States Narcotic Farm in Lexington Ky. to test its abuse potential on detoxified addicts. A prison that doubled as a treatment hospital the farm was home to the governmentÂ€Â™s Addiction Research Center (and at times to jazz greats like Chet Baker Elvin Jones and Sonny Rollins).         With opposition to human research mounting buprenorphine would be the last drug tested there; government scientists justified the research by arguing that the painkiller also had the potential to treat addiction.         Â€ÂœHereÂ€Â™s the thing: The Lexingtonians were against methadoneÂ€Âù said Nancy Campbell a historian of drug policy. Â€ÂœThey felt like addicts liked it too much and it had overdose potential. They never thought abstinence and Â€Â˜Just Say NoÂ€Â™ would work with this population. So they were eager to find an alternative.Â€Âù         The idea of using opioid substitutes to treat opioid dependence is based on the premise that long-term drug use profoundly alters the brain that the craving seeking and taking of opioids is a Â€Âœbio-behavioralÂ€Âù compulsion. While addiction is considered a chronic relapsing disease experts believe that replacing illegal drugs with legal ones needles with pills or liquids and more dangerous opioids with safer ones reduces the harm to addicts and to society.         Like heroin buprenorphine attaches to the brainÂ€Â™s opioid receptors but it does not plug in as completely. It is slower acting and longer lasting attenuating the rush of sensation and eliminating the plummets afterward. Addicts develop a tolerance to its euphoric effects and describe themselves as normalized by it their cravings satisfied. It also diminishes the effects of other opioids but studies have shown does not entirely block them even at the highest recommended doses.         A devoted cadre of government scientists saw buprenorphine as a Â€Âœholy grailÂ€Âù and over the next few decades Â€Âœfloated in between the public and private sector for most of their careersÂ€Âù Dr. Campbell said. The farmÂ€Â™s pharmacist would become an executive vice president of Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals for example and the company would contract with the former National Institute on Drug Abuse director who originally promoted the public-private partnership.         It was a collaboration that the company whose brand names include Lysol resisted for a long time said Charles OÂ€Â™Keeffe a former White House drug policy official who incorporated Reckitt in the United States.         Â€ÂœThey were grocersÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœFinally I went to the board and said Â€Â˜ItÂ€Â™s for the social good.Â€Â™ Ultimately they relented but said Â€Â˜Just donÂ€Â™t spend a lot of money.Â€Â™Ã‚Â Â€Âù         He did not have to. The federal  Further the F.D.A. granted the company a seven-year monopoly based on its claim that it would never recoup its development costs. (Reckitt now has a market value of $56.7 billion; 21 percent of its operating profits last year came from Suboxone.)         Still hurdles had to be cleared.         First Mr. OÂ€Â™Keeffe said Â€ÂœWe had to change the law because it would have been illegal.Â€Âù         The Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 as interpreted prohibited doctors from prescribing narcotics to narcotics addicts Â€Âœto maintain their addictions.Â€Âù In the 1970s methadone treatment was authorized but limited to clinics where the drug was dispensed usually daily.         The original advocates of buprenorphine though wanted to make addiction treatment mainstream rather than segregate addicts in clinics that became lightning rods for community opposition. They wanted doctors in offices to prescribe it just like any other take-home medication.         So Mr. OÂ€Â™Keeffe found Â€Âœinfluential members of Congress interested in doing thisÂ€Âù: Senators Carl Levin Democrat of Michigan and Orrin G. Hatch Republican of Utah with support from Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. Democrat of Delaware. In the end because of law enforcement concerns the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 included unique prescribing restrictions: that doctors seek federal permission get eight hours of training accept a 30-patient limit and attest to their ability to make counseling referrals.         The concerns grew from other countriesÂ€Â™ experiences with buprenorphine treatment over the previous decade; successes had been accompanied by abuses. So F.D.A. officials insisted on the addition of an Â€Âœabuse deterrentÂ€Âù Â€Â” naloxone. If addicts crushed and injected the tablets the naloxone would precipitate excruciating withdrawal symptoms.         The Drug Enforcement Administration was skeptical saying studies showed that naloxone did not provoke Â€Âœany evidence of withdrawalÂ€Âù in Â€Âœa substantial percentageÂ€Âù of opiate abusers and that the amount in the proposed compound would produce only a half-hour of Â€ÂœunpleasantnessÂ€Âù in those susceptible.         Skeptical too were buprenorphineÂ€Â™s original champions at Reckitt who would have preferred a different additive or more naloxone. Â€ÂœIt was not a perfect solutionÂ€Âù Dr. Lewis said.         Even so Suboxone Â€Â” four parts buprenorphine one part naloxone Â€Â” was created. And in late 2002 along with Subutex (plain buprenorphine) it was approved by the F.D.A. just as its target audience was about to expand unexpectedly.         An estimated 2.5 million Americans were dependent on or abused opioids last year mostly painkillers although heroin dependence has skyrocketed with the number of addicts doubling over a decade to 467000 government data indicate. In 2010 the last year studied 19154 people died of opioid overdoses.         Â€ÂœHad buprenorphine never been released and all we had was methadone that number would be much higherÂ€Âù said Dr. Andrew Kolodny the president of  In the early days of Suboxone with Reckitt Benckiser barely marketing its own drug Dr. Kolodny then a New York City health official crisscrossed the city with colleagues to spread the word about the new medication entice public hospitals to try it with $10000 rewards and urge doctors to get certified.         Â€ÂœWe had New York City staff out there acting like drug repsÂ€Âù Dr. Kolodny said.         He himself became a prescriber. Â€ÂœAll of a sudden I started getting calls from white kids on Long Island who were all addicted to pain pillsÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœIt was 2003 or 2004 and my first experience of the painkiller epidemic.Â€Âù         A psychiatrist accustomed to the slow subtle effects of  Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m thinking this cures all addictionsÂ€Âù he said.         Dr. Jeffrey T. Junig of Wisconsin experienced a similar revelation. He was concerned that buprenorphine would create Â€Âœall these dry drunks people who were no longer using but who hadnÂ€Â™t addressed their defects.Â€Âù Instead he witnessed something different: Â€ÂœThe process of craving opioids itself causes people to be so one-dimensional that it is a defect itself. Freed from the obsession to use people change.Â€Âù         Buprenorphine worked so well on his first patients middle-aged painkiller addicts that Â€Âœthey would have tears rolling down their faces talking about how grateful they wereÂ€Âù he said.         Among them was Shawn Schneider who had found his way to Dr. Junig after swallowing 400 milligrams of Ambien thinking Â€ÂœIf I wake up I wake up; if I die I die.Â€Âù         Like Mr. Schneider dozens of addicts interviewed portrayed themselves as exhausted and frightened before they started on Suboxone. They acknowledged having Â€ÂœlovedÂ€Âù their chosen opiate but not what turned into a miserable existence dominated by drug-seeking to avoid Â€Âœdope sickness.Â€Âù         Travis Norton 33 gravitated to heroin in  Â€ÂœI was a chronic relapseÂ€Âù said Mr. Norton who is now an addiction counselor in a Minneapolis suburb. Â€ÂœI was a wreck until I started maintenance therapy in 2003. And IÂ€Â™ve been great since.Â€Âù         Mr. Norton switched for a time to methadone when his Suboxone doctor retired. At that point Suboxone around $16 for an average daily dose was considered Â€Âœthe rich manÂ€Â™s methadone.Â€Âù Mr. Norton not rich but a college-educated professional found the methadone clinic Â€Âœa ball and a chain.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœI had to travel for my job and there was zero flexibilityÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœThey had thousands of clients and I was a number.Â€Âù         Dr. Edwin A. Salsitz of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York who has been treating addiction for decades said that in the pre-Suboxone universe he encountered all too many middle-class addicts who refused to set foot in a clinic.         Â€ÂœAnd then sometimes a couple of years later theyÂ€Â™d be  Reckitt Benckiser gradually built a stable of doctors paid to advocate use of the treatment Dr. Salsitz among them.         The recruiting was tough. Those outside the addiction field were reluctant to deal with the hassles of certification potential visits by the D.E.A. and the addicts themselves. Within the field buprenorphine faced stiff opposition from the methadone industry as well as traditional rehabilitation programs and the Alcoholics Anonymous movement which promotes abstinence.         Â€ÂœWith Suboxone there is a lot of misinformation out there and the most common is youÂ€Â™ve replaced one drug with anotherÂ€Âù said Melissa Iverson a 48-year-old social worker who lives in Florida and is now on disability because of  Ms. Iverson first requested anonymity like most other professionals interviewed some of whom have never acknowledged their problem to their families primary care physicians or even insurers. Eventually she decided to Â€Âœcome out of the closetÂ€Âù saying Â€ÂœThe stigma needs to be tackled by real people with real names or else it will haunt us forever.Â€Âù         Relying on ever-escalating doses of painkillers to cope with her chronic pain she had gone Â€Âœcrazy out of control.Â€Âù Her life revolved around pills; she would pass out smoking in bed and wake up with burns on her hands or get into car accidents and nod out in the tow truck. Four years ago she had Â€Âœa  In contrast to her painkiller use she has taken Suboxone at increasingly lower doses finding that it alleviates her pain without Â€Âœthose self-destructive behaviors.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœAs an addict I was high all the timeÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœWith Suboxone I developed a tolerance within a week. ThereÂ€Â™s zero euphoria.Â€Âù         Successes like hers multiplied until demand outstripped supply because of the limited number of doctors and the patient cap. This brought some unintended consequences.         First some prescribers pushed patients off the medication prematurely to replace them with new patients because the early treatment phase was more lucrative. Second patients began sharing the drug trading it and selling it. Buprenorphine trickled out onto the street.         Health officials concerned about restricted access lobbied alongside Reckitt Benckiser for the patient cap to be raised. Â€ÂœWhy should we bind a healerÂ€Â™s hands from helping as many as he or she could?Â€Âù Senator Hatch said getting an amendment passed in 2006 that allowed doctors on request to go from 30 to 100 patients after a year.         The stage was set for more patients prescriptions and problems. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s when the limit was raised from 30 that doctors started to get commercial about itÂ€Âù said Dr. Art Van Zee whose buprenorphine program at a federally funded community health center in rural Virginia is surrounded by for-profit clinics where doctors charge $100 for weekly visits pulling in he estimated about $500000 a year.         Â€ÂœThey are not savvy about addiction medicine donÂ€Â™t follow patients very closely donÂ€Â™t do urine testing and overprescribeÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœThatÂ€Â™s how buprenorphine became a street drug in our area.Â€Âù         In Fond du Lac Wis. on the shores of Lake Winnebago addicts come and go from a bland building housing a medical office a cheese business and a title company. They bring their tumultuous lives into a tranquil space with hunter green walls heathered carpet and easy-listening music presided over by Dr. JunigÂ€Â™s wife Nancy candy jar by her side.         Fond du Lac Psychiatry is the kind of setting the original idealists envisioned. They did not foresee the buprenorphine mega-clinics that resemble and frequently double as painkiller pill mills sometimes with armed guards to protect their cash.         They did not foresee a buprenorphine empire like the one Dr. Thomas E. Radecki 67 built in northwestern Pennsylvania.         According to the evidence presented to a grand jury this summer Dr. Radecki operated four clinics under the business name Doctors and Lawyers for a Drug-Free Youth serving 1000 people many of whom did not need or use buprenorphine and resold it in their neighborhoods. To override the patient limit he employed other doctors part time. He sold the drug directly to patients which is legal and was the countryÂ€Â™s largest individual buyer of buprenorphine in the first half of last year according to investigators. The previous year he netted $280000 in profits from the tablets alone they said.         In August the Pennsylvania attorney general announced Dr. RadeckiÂ€Â™s arrest on charges of improper prescribing and trading addiction drugs for sex. His lawyer John Froese said Dr. Radecki Â€Âœdenies that he ever prescribed any medicine that was not helpful to his patientsÂ€Âù or had sexual relationships with his buprenorphine patients.         Dr. Radecki lost his Illinois license for just such a relationship and his Pennsylvania license was made probationary in 2007. Nonetheless the federal government subsequently authorized him to prescribe buprenorphine and then expand his patient load.         Â€ÂœVery few if anyÂ€Âù doctors are denied permission unless they are Â€Âœunder investigation or something pops upÂ€Âù said Rusty Payne a D.E.A. spokesman.         The Times analyzed the disciplinary records of the doctors on the federal governmentÂ€Â™s online listing of buprenorphine providers which is not comprehensive because doctors can opt out and calculated state-by-state disciplinary rates.         In 30 of the 31 states that provided their overall disciplinary rates for comparison buprenorphine doctors are far more likely to have been sanctioned than doctors over all. In Florida and Kentucky they are four times as likely to have been sanctioned. In New York they are six times as likely; in Arizona seven times; in Minnesota nine times; and in Louisiana 10 times.         Rates are even higher for the subset certified to treat the maximum patient load The Times found in analyzing records from a sampling of states.         In Ohio nearly 17 percent have disciplinary records compared with 1.6 percent of all doctors. They include individuals sanctioned for:  Some were reprimanded or placed on probation before becoming Suboxone doctors; others stripped of their licenses recently had their offices shuttered.         This adds to the volatility of the treatment culture.         A 30-year-old Michigan woman said she was invited into treatment by a doctor who frequented the strip club where she was a bartender and who paid for her medication for several months. When he was placed on probation for Â€Âœviolation of duty/negligenceÂ€Âù unrelated to her she switched to a second doctor who also got in trouble. After that the woman bought her buprenorphine on the street for a year Â€Â” saving $5500 in medical and counseling fees she noted Â€Â” until she found an addiction specialist with an opening.         In some areas like New York City there is almost a glut of buprenorphine prescribers. In others specialists routinely turn away addicts begging for help.         Non-specialists pick up the slack.         Reckitt Benckiser recruited Â€Âœany doctor willingÂ€Âù said one former company drug representative who asked not to be identified to protect her career. Those in her territory ranged from Â€Âœextremely passionateÂ€Âù to intensely commercial she said: Â€ÂœOne charged a $50 co-pay and another $500 for an initial visit. I had a few physicians using the medication themselves. One guy was so enthusiastic I signed him up as a treatment advocate but then it turned out he relapsed and lost his license.Â€Âù         Just because doctors have disciplinary histories does not mean that they are unscrupulous. Some of the most knowledgeable compassionate addiction doctors are former addicts themselves with medical board actions on their records that sometimes limit their career options.         Dr. Junig 53 is an anesthesiologist with a doctorate in neurochemistry who retrained as a psychiatrist after his own recovery from addiction. He did not intend to become a buprenorphine doctor.         Â€ÂœTo be honest I was just trying to build a practiceÂ€Âù he said.         Nor did he intend to become a buprenorphine blogger or the host of an online conversation about the drug through his website  In 2011 the Wisconsin medical board reprimanded him for using Â€Âœtele-psychiatryÂ€Âù to treat five out-of-state addicts he had seen only over Skype.         Over time Dr. Junig said he moved Â€Âœfrom skeptic to true believer to skeptic.Â€Âù Others similarly modulated their enthusiasm as they gained a nuanced appreciation of the difficulties of managing a complex patient population and a medication that had become a rampant street drug.         Some patients stopped and started their medication so they could still use other opiates or mixed it dangerously with drugs like Xanax. Appointments were missed prescriptions Â€Âœlost.Â€Âù Patients cheated dropped out and relapsed sometimes fatally.         Joseph McMahon IV a gregarious troubled New Yorker was prescribed a couple of thousand Suboxone pills over nearly three years. Still he overdosed on other drugs at least five times and at 25 died of one final overdose in December 2011 turning his father a retired New York City fire lieutenant into a bereft chronicler of Suboxone abuse.         Â€ÂœMy son swore Suboxone was working for himÂ€Âù Joseph McMahon III said. Â€ÂœBut if IÂ€Â™m an alcoholic and you switch my Budweiser for a Bud Lite sure IÂ€Â™m doing great. They call Suboxone Â€Â˜heroin in a pill.Â€Â™ It makes tons of money for the pharmaceutical industry which has us totally bamboozled and for these doctors.Â€Âù         For Dr. Junig early positive experiences with older patients have been offset by rocky ones with a new generation of heroin and Â€Âœpoly-drugÂ€Âù abusers.         Last spring he prepared to confront a 26-year-old patient who had landed in an emergency room with an arm infected from injecting cocaine. The man had tried to hide his cocaine use by presenting a specimen of Â€Âœold urineÂ€Âù to Dr. Junig who said Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m an inch from kicking him out but I think heÂ€Â™ll die if I do.Â€Âù         The patient a mechanic with a young daughter said he had Â€Âœslipped upÂ€Âù during a period of homelessness. Â€ÂœIt was just cocaineÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœI donÂ€Â™t even really like cocaine. I wanted to tell you so bad man. But if I lose the Suboxone IÂ€Â™ll go back to the heroin and the pills and then IÂ€Â™ll be in real trouble.Â€Âù         Dr. Junig told the mechanic he would be summoned for surprise testing.         Â€ÂœWhat worries me most are the needlesÂ€Âù the doctor said. Â€ÂœBut people die from cocaine you know. What you were doing Â€Â” thereÂ€Â™s a genuine risk. If you get busted for cocaine you could end up in a situation where social services are involved. People lose their kids.Â€Âù         In late 2009 a discovery made in a Walgreens in Michigan lit up the forums where recovering addicts chat: Â€ÂœGeneric bupe!Â€Âù         The F.D.A. had just approved generic Subutex buprenorphine without the abuse deterrent despite Reckitt BenckiserÂ€Â™s effort to prevent it. It was according to that post about one-third the cost of brand-name Suboxone.         For the previous six years Reckitt Benckiser with the governmentÂ€Â™s support had successfully discouraged Subutex except in special circumstances. Doctors and insurers told that Suboxone was safer had favored it.         But then Suboxone itself ended up being diverted misused and abused by injection indicating that the safeguard was not foolproof although Reckitt says it stands by it. So when uninsured patients clamored for the cheaper generic some doctors including Dr. Kolodny started accommodating them.         Â€ÂœAt first I did believe the marketing that there was a booby trap in thereÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœBut my impression is that it doesnÂ€Â™t work as well as promised as an abuse deterrent.Â€Âù         The most recent data signal an escalating problem with buprenorphine.         Last year forensic laboratories identified 10804 drug seizures as buprenorphine up eightfold from 2006.         In 2011 emergency room visits for the nonmedical use of buprenorphine were estimated at 21483 nearly five times what they were in 2006. Also in 2011 poison centers recorded 3625 cases of toxic buprenorphine exposure nearly five times as high as the previous year.         More young children were hospitalized because of accidental ingestion of buprenorphine than for any other medication in 2010 and 2011 a federal study found. Another study financed by Reckitt of 2380 buprenorphine overdoses in young children found that 587 had to be hospitalized in intensive care units and that four died.         John Burke the president of the  Â€ÂœI wouldnÂ€Â™t say buprenorphine is not a serious problem; itÂ€Â™s a product for addicts so the propensity for diversion is probably much higher than with the other prescription drugsÂ€Âù he said.

Growing up together in Tehran they had found a sound: part punk part garage rock part their own invention.         The Yellow Dogs as the four Iranian musicians were known played in the shadows until 2009 when they appeared in a film about IranÂ€Â™s underground music scene that garnered international attention. The next year they left for America finding their way to East Williamsburg Brooklyn where their tidy house became a hub for fellow musicians and Iranians.         Hailed as countercultural heroes in Iran they were a few musicians among many in Brooklyn working day and night to stay afloat playing in basements and lofts until they scored better gigs. And then suddenly in the early hours of Monday morning two of them and another musician were dead shot by another Iranian musician who then killed himself.         While the precise motive was unclear it seemed that money distrust and discord sown amid a tight fraternity of Iranian rock artists were to blame.         If the Yellow Dogs had begun to find success in Brooklyn Â€Â” they were playing at venues like the Music Hall of Williamsburg and Brooklyn Bowl Â€Â” the gunman Ali Akbar Mohammadi Rafie had joined his fellow Iranians in Brooklyn only to struggle. Though he had left Iran as part of another band the Free Keys who stayed at the Yellow DogsÂ€Â™ house when they arrived in New York in 2011 his relations with both bands had frayed.         While they continued to live in Brooklyn he had moved to Ridgewood Queens less than two miles away. There were accusations that he had stolen money from the Free Keys who forced him to leave the band last year said John J. McCarthy the Police DepartmentÂ€Â™s chief spokesman. He was in the United States on a temporary worker visa.         Mr. Rafie tried to rejoin the group only to be rebuffed Mr. McCarthy said. Â€ÂœHeÂ€Â™s upset that heÂ€Â™s not in the bandÂ€Âù he said.         The outlines provided by the police of the gunmanÂ€Â™s march through the East Williamsburg townhouse are chilling.         Mr. Rafie climbed to the Yellow DogsÂ€Â™ house at 318 Maujer Street across adjacent roofs Mr. McCarthy said. On one investigators found an empty guitar case which they believe was used to transport the assault rifle he used in his attack.         He found his way to a third-floor landing of the home. There he fired once through a window into a living room striking and killing Ali Eskandarian 35 an Iranian-American singer songwriter and writer who had been living in the apartment above the Yellow Dogs.         Mr. Rafie then climbed inside found Arash Farazmand 28 the Yellow DogsÂ€Â™ drummer in his bedroom and opened fire fatally shooting him. His brother Soroush Farazmand 27 the bandÂ€Â™s guitarist was in his second-floor bedroom on his bed and pecking away at his laptop. Mr. Rafie burst in and shot him in the chest killing him.         Shots appeared to have also been fired down a hallway and into a second-floor room striking Sasan Sadeghpourosko 22 another resident in the shoulder and elbow. On the third floor were a man and a woman members of the Coast Guard who had rented a room for Veterans Day events and Pooya Hosseini another Iranian musician from the Free Keys.         Mr. Rafie kicked in the door and he and Mr. Hosseini a former bandmate struggled over the rifle. Several shots went off. Unhurt Mr. Hosseini fled and Mr. Rafie headed to the roof where he shot himself in the head.         Mr. Sadeghpourosko a street artist was treated at Elmhurst Hospital Center and released. His brother who was also in the room was not injured.         The other members of the Yellow Dogs Koory Mirz the bassist and Siavash Karampour the lead singer known as Obash were not there at the time.         Before fleeing for the United States in 2010 the four bandmates belonged to TehranÂ€Â™s Â€Âœsmall but crazyÂ€Âù underground club scene according to a State Department 54,1E+14,1,Article,News,Accord Reached With Iran to Halt Nuclear Program,World,637,5.826,5.587,GENEVA Â€Â” The United States and five other world powers announced a landmark accord Sunday morning that would temporarily freeze  It was the first time in nearly a decade American officials said that an international agreement had been reached to halt much of IranÂ€Â™s nuclear program and roll some elements of it back.         The aim of the accord which is to last six months is to give international negotiators time to pursue a more comprehensive pact that would ratchet back much of IranÂ€Â™s nuclear program and ensure that it could be used only for peaceful purposes.         Shortly after the agreement was signed at 3 a.m. in the Palace of Nations in Geneva President Obama speaking from the State Dining Room in the White House hailed it as the most Â€Âœsignificant and tangibleÂ€Âù progress of a diplomatic campaign that began when he took office.         Â€ÂœToday that diplomacy opened up a new path toward a world that is more secureÂ€Âù he said Â€Âœa future in which we can verify that IranÂ€Â™s nuclear program is peaceful and that it cannot build a nuclear weapon.Â€Âù         In Geneva the Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said he hoped the agreement would lead to a Â€ÂœrestorationÂ€Âù of trust between  Secretary of State  Iran which has long resisted international monitoring efforts and built clandestine nuclear facilities agreed to stop enriching uranium beyond 5 percent a level that would be sufficient for energy production but that would require further enrichment for bomb-making. To make good on that pledge Iran will dismantle links between networks of centrifuges.         Its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20 percent a short hop from weapons-grade fuel would be diluted or converted into oxide so that it could not be readily used for military purposes. Iran agreed that it would not install any new centrifuges start up any that are not already operating or build new enrichment facilities.         The agreement however does not require Iran to stop enriching uranium to a low level of 3.5 percent or to dismantle any of its existing centrifuges.         The accord was a disappointment for Israel which had urged the United States to pursue a stronger agreement that would lead to a complete end to IranÂ€Â™s enrichment program. But Iran made it clear that continuing enrichment was a prerequisite for any agreement.         The United States did not accept IranÂ€Â™s claim that it had a Â€Âœright to enrichÂ€Âù under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. But American officials signaled last week that they were open to a compromise in which the two sides would essentially agree to disagree on how the proliferation treaty should be interpreted while Tehran continued to enrich.         In return for the initial agreement the United States agreed to provide $6 billion to $7 billion in sanctions relief. Of this roughly $4.2 billion would be oil revenue that has been frozen in foreign banks.         This limited sanctions relief can be accomplished by executive order allowing the Obama administration to make the deal without having to appeal to Congress where there is strong criticism of any agreement that does not fully dismantle IranÂ€Â™s nuclear program.         The fact that the accord would only pause the Iranian program was seized on by critics who said it would reward Iran for institutionalizing the status quo.         Mr. Obama addressed those concerns in his speech insisting that the easing of sanctions could be reversed if Iran failed to reach a final agreement or reneged on the terms of this one.         Â€ÂœNothing will be agreed to unless everything is agreed toÂ€Âù he said.         He also noted the qualms of Israel Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf allies of the United States saying they Â€Âœhad good reason to be skeptical of IranÂ€Â™s intentions.Â€Âù But he said he had a Â€Âœprofound responsibilityÂ€Âù to test the possibilities of a diplomatic solution.         In Geneva Mr. Kerry said of the agreement: Â€ÂœIt will make our partners in the region safer. It will make our ally Israel safer.Â€Âù        182,1E+14,0,Article,News,Cardinals Beat Rams 30-10 to End NFC West Skid,Sports,778,5.252,5.437,"GLENDALE Ariz. Â€Â” Carson Palmer didn't throw a pass in practice all last week then completed practically every one he tried Sunday.         So much for that sore right elbow.         Palmer completed 27 of 32 12 of them to Larry Fitzgerald and the Cardinals ended an eight-game losing streak against NFC West foes by beating the St. Louis Rams 30-10.         It was the second-highest completion percentage (84.4) in franchise history. Only Kurt Warner's NFL record of 92.3 percent (24 of 26) against Jacksonville in 2009 was better.         Palmer said he had no idea what his statistics were just that things were working at a nice clip.         ""When the plays were coming in I knew exactly where to go with the ball"" he said.         Palmer hurt his throwing elbow in last week's loss at Philadelphia. From Monday on trainer Tom Reed decided there would be no passing in practice.         ""I didn't throw one ball and I was definitely worried about that"" Palmer said ""but that was the plan.""         It worked to near perfection.         Palmer threw for 269 yards and a touchdown with no interceptions as the Cardinals (8-5) won for the fifth time in six games. He was sacked once.         ""I can't say enough about where he is right now"" Arizona coach Bruce Arians said. ""The level he's playing is extremely high.""         Arizona's Karlos Dansby returned an interception 23 yards for a touchdown and John Abraham tackled Kellen Clemens for a safety.         Tavon Austin's 56-yard run set up the only touchdown for the Rams (5-8) a 1-yard run by Zac Stacy. Austin injured his left ankle on the play and didn't return. The loss mathematically eliminated the Rams from postseason contention.         The Cardinals lost rookie safety Tyrann Mathieu in the third quarter. Arians said it ""appears to be an ACL"" injury to his left knee.         Arizona had not beaten an NFC West opponent since downing Seattle in the 2012 opener. The Cardinals lost three in a row this season including 27-24 at St. Louis in the opener. Arians hammered that home last week.         ""I can't use the words he used"" Dansby said. ""My mom would get at me if I do that but he let it be known that we were at the bottom of the totem pole and we've got to climb our way out.""         Fitzgerald's 12 catches went for 96 yards including a 7-yarder for a touchdown. It was his most receptions since he matched his career high with 13 against Seattle on Oct. 18 2009.         Dansby had his second touchdown return of an interception in three games. He returned one 22 yards in Arizona's 40-11 rout of Indianapolis.         Mathieu the ""Honey Badger"" having a terrific rookie season was hurt after returning the free kick that followed the safety in the third quarter. He jogged toward the Arizona bench but his knee buckled and he collapsed then he was carted off the field.         The Arizona safety came after a Cardinals punt was downed at the Rams 1. On third down from the 5 Clemens retreated to the end zone and was hit by Abraham who had three sacks to give him 11 this season.         Other than Austin's big run St. Louis managed just 44 yards on the ground in 18 attempts. Rams coach Jeff Fisher said he was well aware how strong Arizona's defensive front was.         ""I thought we would do a better job than we did but we couldn't run the football today"" he said.         In the first half Palmer completed 16 of 17 for 169 yards and a touchdown. He would have had another TD had Jim Dray not fumbled at the half-yard line. Palmer completed his first 10 passes.         Arizona took the opening kickoff and went 80 yards in eight plays Rashard Mendenhall scoring on a 3-yard run. The Rams responded with Greg Zuerlein's 44-yard field goal.         On St. Louis' second play from scrimmage in the third period Calais Campbell pressured Clemens. Dansby stepped in front of intended receiver Jared Cook picked off the pass and ran untouched 23 yards to make it 21-3.         Notes: Abraham moved past Lawrence Taylor and Leslie O'Neal into ninth on the NFL career sacks list with 133. ... Dansby has four interception returns for scores for the Cardinals in two stints with the team. Only Aeneas Williams (six) and Larry Wilson (five) have more in franchise history. ... Arizona has outscored its last two opponents at home 70-21 and is 6-1 at home. ... The Rams were penalized 11 times for 90 yards. ...

But unlike earlier this year when fears of the stimulus withdrawal had caused jitters in the markets the investors are focusing more on the improvements in the economy.

Blanketed with giddy images drawing street artists from around the world  But early Tuesday under the cover of night painters quietly blanketed much of the walls of 5Pointz with whitewash erasing the work of hundreds and seemingly putting the final nail in the long battle between the buildingÂ€Â™s owners who plan to erect luxury apartments and the artists who fought to save it.         Â€ÂœThis is the biggest rag and disrespect in the history of graffitiÂ€Âù said a teary-eyed Marie Cecile Flaguel a spokeswoman for the group behind 5Pointz which sprang like a rainbow from the gray sidewalks near Jackson Avenue in Long Island City. Â€ÂœHeÂ€Â™s painted over the work of at least 1500 artists.Â€Âù         The owner of the buildings Jerry Wolkoff however said painting over the artwork was the humane thing to do. A recent order by a federal judge allows him to move forward with his plans to demolish the buildings by yearÂ€Â™s end and he said watching the art-covered walls be pulled down piece by piece would be Â€Âœtorture.Â€Âù         He also wanted to avoid a confrontation adding that there would be a 60-foot-high wall near the new towers where graffiti painters can work again.         Â€ÂœI am telling you I did not like what they did Â€Â” I loved what they didÂ€Âù said Mr. Wolkoff who bought the buildings in 1971 and plans to build high-rise towers in their stead. Â€ÂœI cried this morning I swear to you.Â€Âù         Yet many supporters of 5Pointz which became so well established that tourists flocked to it by the busload saw the clandestine erasing as a cruel vindictive move.         Â€ÂœThe fact that they destroyed the art before they razed the building itÂ€Â™s a really big slap in the faceÂ€Âù said Eric Felisbret an expert on street art and the author of Â€ÂœGraffiti New York.Â€Âù Â€ÂœSo many people put so much passion and energy into it.Â€Âù         Though there are other spots in New York City where graffiti artists could legally work Mr. Felisbret said Â€ÂœThereÂ€Â™s nothing that was as large and that big of a draw internationallyÂ€Âù as 5Pointz.         Forty years ago after buying the buildings which were mostly abandoned at the time Mr. Wolkoff leased the space to a company that made record player accessories then eight-track tapes and then CD covers before moving out in the early 1990s.         Casting about for new tenants Mr. Wolkoff rented studios to artists for a few hundred dollars a month. Around that time he was also approached by a man who removed graffiti from buildings around the city and wanted to know if the painters could use Mr. WolkoffÂ€Â™s walls as canvases. Liking their work Mr. Wolkoff gave them more and more space. In 2002 a graffiti artist named Meres One took the endeavor over becoming its curator and christening it 5Pointz.         Five stories high the buildings occupied most of a city block a playful wacky visual counterpoint to the solemn low-slung MoMA PS 1 site across the street. The canary yellow walls were covered with constantly changing artwork Â€Â” Brobdingnagian bubble letters colorful cartoons and meticulously wrought images created by painters from France Italy Japan and beyond. Stepping into 5PointzÂ€Â™s interior courtyard was like plunging into a lurid fever dream.         Though street art is meant to be temporary 5Pointz became known as a graffiti museum. And the medium itself once considered a symbol of urban unraveling became a sought after gallery-worthy commodity with work from street artists like Banksy commanding millions of dollars. Which is one of the reasons the whitewashing of 5PointzÂ€Â™s walls was greeted with such vociferous dismay. Â€ÂœWhat?!

Losing at home to San Antonio last month by 31 points was understandable if not acceptable. But what could be said about absorbing the third-worst loss in franchise history to a team in full rebuilding mode after hiring Stevens formerly of Butler to reflect the storied CelticsÂ€Â™ downsizing to N.B.A. midmajor status?         Â€ÂœI wish I could explain itÂ€Âù was the best Woodson could say about the crash and burn of the formerly trending notion that his 5-14 team had reawakened from its early-season coma. A frustrated and bewildered  But as much temptation as there is to make this about the perceptibly swell job that Stevens has done in getting the Celtics to play with a collective and collegiate purpose while guiding them to the top of the Atlantic Division Â€Â” with twice as many victories as the Knicks Â€Â” letÂ€Â™s hold off on that story line.         LetÂ€Â™s defer to Stevens who said Â€ÂœEverything we did will get overexaggerated and everything they did will get overexaggerated.Â€Âù         In the spirit of StevensÂ€Â™s call for a pragmatic caution we can wait for Friday nightÂ€Â™s rematch in Boston before making a more definitive assessment of what to make of the KnicksÂ€Â™ coming out for a noon tip and trailing Jeff Green Avery Bradley and friends by 25-3 before the game was nine minutes old.         When it was over when the Celtics had outrebounded the jump-shooting-crazed home team by 46-26 and outscored them inside by 42-22 Tommy Heinsohn a Retired Number Celtic and a legendarily provincial broadcaster strolled into the Boston locker room and asked Â€ÂœWas that good or was that good?Â€Âù         Sitting near the entrance point guard Rajon Rondo who is recovering from knee surgery looked up from his smartphone and smirked.         In the news Â€Â” if you could call it that Â€Â” was a recent report emanating from an old prep school coach of AnthonyÂ€Â™s suggesting that New YorkÂ€Â™s leading man has been trying to talk Rondo into signing with the Knicks when his contract with the Celtics expires after next season. If Anthony is the KnicksÂ€Â™ chief recruiter when heÂ€Â™s already on record as planning to opt out of his own contract next summer to explore free agency itÂ€Â™s no wonder the franchise is in such a state of confusion.         Fortunately Rondo declined to dribble the crystal ball invoking his right as an injured player not to speak with reporters. But his presence at the Garden was also a reminder that he is planning a return and healthy is an All-Star who certainly would have some effect on a divisional race that could be a season-long bumper-cars concession.         By next summer if the Celtics have decided they canÂ€Â™t risk losing Rondo on the open market without getting anything in return he could also become a formidable trade chip. If you havenÂ€Â™t heard Danny Ainge BostonÂ€Â™s president for basketball operations seems to know what heÂ€Â™s doing after punctuating the Doc Rivers/Kevin Garnett/Paul Pierce era last summer.         The pawning off of his geriatric warriors Pierce and Garnett on the Nets helped stock the Celtics with nine first-round picks during the next five years. They already have some young talent Â€Â” their second-year forward-center Jared Sullinger made 9 of 13 shots and outscored the KnicksÂ€Â™ Andrea Bargnani 21-2.         Conversely Iman Shumpert by reputation the KnicksÂ€Â™ best young player began his day by shooting an air ball dribbling the ball off his foot and futilely chasing assorted Celtics as fluid body and ball movement created lanes to the basket and open-perimeter looks that resulted in BostonÂ€Â™s making 14 of 25 3-point attempts.         Shumpert finished with no points and shot 0 for 6 from the field. It didnÂ€Â™t help him Tim Hardaway Jr. (making his first pro start) or J. R. Smith that the Celtics never had to double-team Anthony after Stevens had said Â€ÂœHeÂ€Â™s one of a handful of players in the league where you go into the game knowing that youÂ€Â™re probably going to have to put two guys on him at some point.Â€Âù         Afterward Stevens admitted Â€ÂœYou donÂ€Â™t want to do that unless you have to and it never really presented itself.Â€Âù         In other words the ball movement shown by the Knicks during their longest winning streak of the season Â€Â” two Â€Â” disappeared because take your pick: Anthony reverted to old habits or everyone else was awful or the KnicksÂ€Â™ offense often breaks down when confronted with determined perimeter resistance.         However ugly this game was the more pertinent and frightening post-mortem for Knicks fans would be to contemplate the Celtics rising to the same competitive plane during Year 1 of their rebuild. Because they do have a plan and the resources to get much better while the Knicks well put it this way: They couldnÂ€Â™t even understand or explain what happened to them Sunday.        28,1E+14,1,Article,News,"With Glut of Lonely Men, China Has an Approved Outlet for Unrequited Lust",World,643,5.941,5.802,GUANGZHOU China Â€Â” Slack-jawed and perspiring Chen Weizhou gazed at a pair of life-size female dolls clad just barely in lingerie and lace stockings.

In June a government official was sentenced to 13 years in prison for corruption after a video surfaced showing him in bed with an 18-year-old woman. His fall came three months after photos depicting a coterie of six naked people including a party official and his wife exploded on the Internet.         In an attempt to give the sex festival a veneer of respectability government-run medical organizations sponsored booths in a side room which were unsurprisingly desolate. The main draw was lust.         Thousands of visitors nearly all middle-aged men wielding cameras poured through the aisles in search of any visible flesh. Â€ÂœGuys have been taking my picture all dayÂ€Âù said a bikini-clad model Liang Lin 23 who was hugging her bare midriff defensively as a throng of men jostled desperately to get a better shot.         Not far away a male crowd waited for a diminutive Japanese pornography star named Rei Mizuna to appear. When she finally emerged from a dressing room to hand out racy autographed photos her frenzied fans surged forward with such zeal they shattered a glass display case.         Those unrequited desires have helped spawn a booming domestic sex toy industry. Â€ÂœA stuffed man doesnÂ€Â™t know what itÂ€Â™s like to be hungryÂ€Âù explained a salesman at one booth filled with inflatable dolls. Just then an older gentleman approached and tried to bargain over an $8 figure with black tresses and a vacant stare.        92,1E+14,0,Article,News,The Takeout Item Left on Bloombergâ€™s Plate,N.Y. / Region,1030,5.539,5.453,He has battled the  While the administration has been pressing the City Council to ban packaging like foam cups and foam takeout food containers from stores and restaurants  In his state of the city address in February Mayor Bloomberg said that foam food containers which are made from expanded polystyrene are Â€Âœvirtually impossible to recycle.Â€Âù Environmental groups have long complained that because the foam does not biodegrade it fills up landfills and cities including Portland Ore. San Francisco and Seattle have already banned them.         The proposed ban which has been amended to give foam makers a year to prove that soiled containers can be recycled is likely to come up for a vote before the end of the year. While the ban would affect only the city the stakes are much higher because many of Mr. BloombergÂ€Â™s health and environmental policies have gone on to be adopted by other cities and states.         Since the mayorÂ€Â™s speech Dart and the American Chemistry Council a trade group have organized small-business owners and lobbied the City Council to make sure a ban does not happen.         Dart has spent $120000 lobbying the City Council and the Bloomberg administration according to city lobbying disclosures. The American Chemistry Council has formed the  Â€ÂœClean foamÂ€Âù the packaging that comes wrapped around appliances such as televisions and computers for example is easier to recycle and has a higher market value experts say.         In dispute is whether Â€Âœdirty foamÂ€Âù food containers soiled with oil grease condiments and leftovers can be recycled. And whether there is a recycling market out there willing to buy it.         Dart says yes. The city says no.         Â€ÂœThe city has a lot to gainÂ€Âù Michael Westerfield director of recycling at Dart told members of the City CouncilÂ€Â™s Sanitation and Solid Waste Management Committee at a hearing last Monday. On the table in front of him were several foam items including a cup a food container an ice chest and packaging material. If the city began recycling the food containers Mr. Westerfield said it could also recycle the other foam products. He then sitting next to foam recyclers and buyers shook a jar of recycled foam pellets at committee members as proof. Â€ÂœThe environment wins because all this stuff sitting on the table with me gets recycledÂ€Âù Mr. Westerfield said.         Mr. Westerfield has cited Los Angeles as an example of a city that recycles foam food containers. But officials there said they tried doing so but stopped because Â€Âœthe end product was coming out contaminatedÂ€Âù said Michael Lee that cityÂ€Â™s project manager for curbside recycling. Los Angeles does recycle clean foam like packing materials but Â€Âœanything contaminated with food waste oil grease we donÂ€Â™t accept itÂ€Âù Mr. Lee said.         The Bloomberg administration has said that besides filling up landfills foam containers gum up the cityÂ€Â™s recycling efforts because many people mistakenly toss them in with their bags of recyclables which then have to be picked through. If the Council allowed a tryout of foam recycling dirty containers Â€Â” like those smeared with food Â€Â” would have to be separated from other recyclables said Caswell F. Holloway the deputy mayor of operations. The added sanitation routes necessary for a separate foam collection would put 1000 more trucks on the street Mr. Holloway said and cost city taxpayers $70 million a year. And in the end he said there is no real market for recycled dirty foam.         Â€ÂœI donÂ€Â™t think that would be practicalÂ€Âù Mr. Holloway told committee members. The ban he said is Â€Âœthe most cost-efficient rational and sensible way to deal with this.Â€Âù         Mr. Westerfield contends that such recycling would not be a problem for New York City. He said the cityÂ€Â™s recycling trucks could pick up foam with metal glass and plastic and at the Sims recycling center in Brooklyn (where Dart has offered to pay for a $500000 sorting machine) the foam would be baled and carried by rail to a plant in Indianapolis where it would be washed dried and sold. Mr. Westerfield also said that Dart would guarantee the city a price of $160 a ton for the recycled foam for five years.         Along with foam makers restaurant and bodega owners have complained that banning foam food containers would force them to use more costly alternatives like paper or plastic which they say do not keep food hot as long as foam. About a half dozen of them wearing matching Restaurant Action Alliance T-shirts testified in a nearly seven-hour hearing last Monday as did Mr. Holloway Mr. Westerfield from Dart employees of polystyrene manufacturers environmentalists teachers and foam recyclers.         The mayorÂ€Â™s original proposal called for a ban on plastic-foam food containers but days before the hearing council members amended it to give Dart until Jan. 1 2015 to prove to the city that foam food service containers could be recycled in a viable way. If Dart failed the ban would take effect July 1 2015.         The bill also gives establishments that gross less than $500000 a year and nonprofit organizations a chance to apply for a waiver from the law and says that only warnings and no fines could be given in the first year. But even with the changes Dart does not support the bill.        112,1E+14,1,Article,Op-Ed,Funny Girl,Opinion,826,5.188,5.838,HOLLYWOOD Â€Â” AS Hollywood bowed down to Hillary Clinton who swept through on a state visit with Chelsea on Friday there seemed to be only one person here with any reservations.

ChinaÂ€Â™s exports of goods rose 12.7 percent in November compared with a year earlier while imports increased 5.3 percent resulting in a trade surplus for the month of $33.8 billion according to data from the General Administration of Customs.         The reported export growth outpaced expectations of a 7.1 percent increase while the increase in imports was less than the 7.2 percent economists had forecast according to the average estimates from a survey of economists by Thomson Reuters.         Analysts said that although the yearly comparison figures were partly bolstered by companiesÂ€Â™ overinvoicing Â€Â” an anomaly of Chinese trade data Â€Â” the underlying export trends were encouraging.         Â€ÂœThe year-on-year growth data overstates the actual export momentumÂ€Âù Louis Kuijs the chief China economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong wrote Sunday in a research note. Â€ÂœNonetheless there are signs that the global activity and trade cycle is gaining momentum driven by the recovery in high-income countries and ChinaÂ€Â™s exporters are benefiting from that.Â€Âù         Improving demand in the West for Chinese goods led to greater-than-expected growth in shipments to major trading partners. ChinaÂ€Â™s exports to the United States rose 17.3 percent last month while shipments to the European Union rose 18.5 percent customs figures show.         As a result ChinaÂ€Â™s trade surplus is soaring to levels not seen in years Â€Â” a development that could draw scrutiny from Western trading partners.         Liu Li-Gang the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group wrote Sunday in a research note that ChinaÂ€Â™s trade surplus was likely to exceed $240 billion this year the highest level since 2008.         This Mr. Liu wrote is Â€Âœcontrary to the fact that renminbi appreciation has significantly eroded trade competitiveness.Â€Âù A stronger currency makes the goods that Chinese manufacturers export relatively more expensive to foreigners.         ChinaÂ€Â™s currency has risen more than 16 percent against the dollar in the last five years to about 6.08 renminbi per dollar from around 7.3 per dollar at the start of 2008.         The stronger currency coupled with rising wages at home and weak demand from overseas have made profitability more difficult for Chinese manufacturers and trading firms in recent years. For example shares in Li & Fung the Hong Kong merchandiser that is one of the  Still appreciation of the currency has slowed substantially in recent months which could be seen as contributing to ChinaÂ€Â™s growing trade surpluses. The renminbi has strengthened only about 0.7 percent against the dollar since May.         Analysts were quick to caution that ChinaÂ€Â™s monthly trade figures could not be taken entirely at face value.         Chinese officials have been working in recent months to compile more accurate trade figures after having reported widely aberrant monthly export and import data early this year and late last year Â€Â” irregularities that analysts have said were caused by companies seeking to evade taxes known as Â€Âœround-trippingÂ€Âù or to disguise capital inflows to China by falsifying the invoiced value of the goods they were shipping abroad.         Â€ÂœThe data in January-November suggest that China could achieve the 8 percent trade growth target for the whole yearÂ€Âù Mr. Liu wrote in his note. Â€ÂœHowever we cannot be overly optimistic as the overinvoicing and round-tripping clearly inflated export growth in the first half of the year.Â€Âù        157,1E+14,0,Article,News,China's Haier Electronics Hit 14 Year High on Alibaba Logistics Deal,Business Day,360,6.04,5.886,HONG KONG Â€Â” Chinese appliance maker Haier Electronics Group Co Ltd agreed to team with e-commerce giant Alibaba Group to further develop its logistics business in a move that sent Haier Electronic's stock to a 14-year high.

Orlando appeared poised to give the Rockets a tough test scoring nine straight points to take a 9-2 lead. But the burst was brief.         The Rockets hurt the Magic from the 3-point line making seven of 11 to erase that run by Orlando in the first quarter. Houston finished 10-for-33 from 3-point range against 8-for-29 for Orlando.

When the anthropologist Sarah B. Hrdy  Science has come a long way since then as Dr. Hrdy notes in her introduction to a recent issue of  The existence of female competition may seem obvious to anyone who has been in a high-school cafeteria or a singles bar but analyzing it has been difficult because it tends be more subtle and indirect (and a lot less violent) than the male variety. Now that researchers have been looking more closely they say that this Â€Âœintrasexual competitionÂ€Âù is the most important factor explaining the pressures that young women feel to meet standards of sexual conduct and physical appearance.         The old doubts about female competitiveness derived partly from an evolutionary analysis of the reproductive odds in ancient  But even in those societies women were not passive trophies for victorious males. They had their own incentives to compete with one another for more desirable partners and more resources for their children. And now that most people live in monogamous societies most women face the same odds as men. In fact they face tougher odds in some places like the many college campuses with more women than men.         To see how female students react to a rival researchers brought pairs of them into a laboratory at McMaster University for what was ostensibly a discussion about female friendships. But the real experiment began when another young woman entered the room asking where to find one of the researchers.         This woman had been chosen by the researchers  In jeans she  They stared at her looked her up and down rolled their eyes and sometimes showed outright anger. One asked her in disgust Â€ÂœWhat the [expletive] is that?Â€Âù         Most of the aggression though happened after she left the room. Then the students laughed about her and impugned her motives. One student suggested that she dressed that way in order to have sex with a professor. Another said that her breasts Â€Âœwere about to pop out.Â€Âù         The results of the experiment jibe with evidence that this Â€Âœmean girlÂ€Âù form of indirect aggression is used more by adolescents and young women than by older women who have less incentive to handicap rivals once they marry. Other studies have shown that the more attractive an adolescent girl or woman is the more likely she is to become  Â€ÂœWomen are indeed very capable of aggressing against others especially women they perceive as rivalsÂ€Âù said Dr. Vaillancourt now a psychologist at the University of Ottawa. Â€ÂœThe research also shows that suppression of female sexuality is by women not necessarily by men.Â€Âù         Stigmatizing female promiscuity Â€Â” a.k.a. slut-shaming Â€Â” has often been blamed on men who have a Darwinian incentive to discourage their spouses from straying. But they also have a Darwinian incentive to encourage other women to be promiscuous. Dr. Vaillancourt said the experiment and other research suggest  Â€ÂœSex is coveted by menÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœAccordingly women limit access as a way of maintaining advantage in the negotiation of this resource. Women who make sex too readily available compromise the power-holding position of the group which is why many women are particularly intolerant of women who are or seem to be promiscuous.Â€Âù         Indirect aggression can take a psychological toll on women who are ostracized or feel pressured to meet impossible standards like the vogue of thin bodies in many modern societies. Studies have shown that womenÂ€Â™s ideal body shape is to be thinner than average Â€Â” and thinner than what men consider the ideal shape to be. This pressure is frequently blamed on the ultrathin female role models featured in magazines and on television but Christopher J. Ferguson and other researchers say that itÂ€Â™s mainly  Â€ÂœTo a large degree the media reflects trends that are going on in society not creates themÂ€Âù said  But he found that women were more likely to feel worse when they compared themselves with peers in their own social circles or even if they were in a room with a thin stranger like the assistant to Dr. Ferguson who ran  Â€ÂœSexual competition among females seems to increase due to circumstances that tend to be particularly common in affluent societiesÂ€Âù Dr. Ferguson said.         In traditional villages people married at an early age to someone nearby but young men and women in modern societies are free to postpone marriage as they search long and far for better options. The result is more competition because there are so many more rivals Â€Â” and thereÂ€Â™s no longer any scientific doubt that both sexes are in to win it.        98,1E+14,1,Article,News,Right Wingâ€™s Surge in Europe Has the Establishment Rattled,World,622,5.922,5.371,HVIDOVRE Denmark Â€Â” As right-wing populists surge across Europe rattling established political parties with their hostility toward immigration austerity and the European Union  A member of DenmarkÂ€Â™s Parliament and he hopes mayor of this commuter-belt town west of Copenhagen Mr. Dencker is furious that some day care centers have removed meatballs a staple of traditional Danish cuisine from their cafeterias in deference to Islamic dietary rules.

In other countries Â€Â” Austria Britain Bulgaria the Czech Republic Finland and the Netherlands Â€Â” disruptive upstart groups are on a roll.         This phenomenon alarms not just national leaders but also officials in Brussels who fear that European Parliament elections next May could substantially tip the balance of power toward nationalists and forces intent on halting or reversing integration within the European Union.         Â€ÂœHistory reminds us that high unemployment and wrong policies like austerity are an extremely poisonous cocktailÂ€Âù said Poul Nyrup Rasmussen a former Danish prime minister and a Social Democrat. Â€ÂœPopulists are always there. In good times it is not easy for them to get votes but in these bad times all their arguments the easy solutions of populism and nationalism are getting new ears and votes.Â€Âù         In some ways this is EuropeÂ€Â™s Tea Party moment Â€Â” a grass-roots insurgency fired by resentment against a political class that many Europeans see as out of touch. The main difference however is that EuropeÂ€Â™s populists want to strengthen not shrink government and see the welfare state as an integral part of their national identities.         The trend in Europe does not signal the return of fascist demons from the 1930s except in Greece where the neo-Nazi party  But the soaring fortunes of groups like the Danish PeopleÂ€Â™s Party which some popularity polls now rank ahead of the Social Democrats point to a fundamental political shift toward nativist forces fed by a curious mix of right-wing identity politics and left-wing anxieties about the future of the welfare state.         Â€ÂœThis is the new normalÂ€Âù said Flemming Rose the foreign editor at the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten. Â€ÂœIt is a nightmare for traditional political elites and also for Brussels.Â€Âù         The platform of FranceÂ€Â™s National Front promotes traditional right-wing causes like law and order and tight controls on immigration but reads in parts like a leftist manifesto. It accuses Â€Âœbig bossesÂ€Âù of promoting open borders so they can import cheap labor to drive down wages.

I guess thatÂ€Â™s why they call it Â€ÂœmotherÂ€Â™s wit.Â€Âù         When my three children were younger and the strain of taking care of them seemed as though it would overwhelm me my mother would tell me what an elderly babysitter once told her when she too felt overwhelmed: Â€ÂœBaby one day theyÂ€Â™ll be able to get themselves a cup of water.Â€Âù         It was a simple way of saying that children grow up and become more self-reliant and eventually they set out on their own to chart their own course. You wonÂ€Â™t always have to wait on them hand and foot.         She told me to remember that the more people a child has who truly loves him or her the happier that child will be. So I work hard to maintain and expand their circles of love.         She taught me that parenting was a lot like giving a hug: ItÂ€Â™s all about love and pressure and there is no one way to do it.         She taught me that sometimes you have to make time for yourself so that you will have energy to give to your children. Allow them to have a pizza night every now and then. An occasional treat wonÂ€Â™t hurt them but working yourself to a frazzle will surely hurt you. Rest.         She taught me that you must allow yourself time to find stillness and so you can be moved by it. Sometimes we are so busy that we forget why weÂ€Â™re busy. We have so many things on our list of priorities that we lose sight of whatÂ€Â™s really important.         And she taught me that my children are not truly mine. They donÂ€Â™t belong to me; theyÂ€Â™ve simply been entrusted to me. They are a gift life gave to me but one that I must one day give back to life. They must grow up and go away and that is as it should be.         But as the time with my children in my home draws to a close Â€Â” my oldest is away at college and my twins are 16-year-old high school juniors Â€Â” IÂ€Â™m beginning to feel the pains in my chest that all parents feel when their children move away.         I thought that this would be a celebratory time a time when I would relish the idea of getting back to me of working late without worry and taking last-minute weekend jaunts.         But I donÂ€Â™t. Letting go is hard for me to do. I must let go but my heart feels hollow. I canÂ€Â™t imagine me without them.         Lately there are times that I find myself just staring at my children that kind of look that says Â€ÂœI see you really see you and I love you with an all-consuming love the kind of love that envelops you and sustains me.Â€Âù ItÂ€Â™s the kind of look that invariably draws from my children a Â€ÂœWhat? What are you looking at?Â€Âù They speak the words through the slightest smile a barely registered one the kind of smile a teenager manages when they know that they are loved but feel that they are too old for hugs or tears.         Life gave them to me. IÂ€Â™m preparing myself as best I can to give them back to life.        14,1E+14,1,Article,News,The Sex Toys in the Attic,Booming,1023,5.136,5.577,IÂ€Â™ve been thinking about an extremely beautiful sex toy an old boyfriend got me Â€Â” I think it is on my mind because he is having heart surgery this week. This is how it is at a certain age; when you hear about an old boyfriend itÂ€Â™s not because he got married or got a great job it is because theyÂ€Â™re threading tubes into his chest and doing an ablation on his heart.         This toy which was silver and shaped like a stylized banana was so complicated I never used it. Also you had to charge it for a few hours. It wasnÂ€Â™t one of those things that charged with a discreet little light either; it blasted O-shaped strobe signals across a darkened room that could have been used to direct incoming flights at a small airport ideally one catering to businessmen whose wives had lost interest in sex years ago. Well thatÂ€Â™s what they all say isnÂ€Â™t it?         As I have a personal code that says you do not use a sex toy given to you by one man with another (yes I do have a Puritan streak) and disliking it anyway I had stashed this thing in a big closet which is like deep space things go there and disappear forever. The other day I heard Sandra Bullock in there hollering.         But now with the old beauÂ€Â™s surgery looming the toy Â€Â” rather its disposal Â€Â” was on my mind. This was a problem. It was not one of those unused household items you can donate to Housing Works; they donÂ€Â™t even take sheets. IÂ€Â™m an environmentally conscious person but I couldnÂ€Â™t see taking it to old electronics day at Union Square. I could put it into the appropriate recycling bin on my floor but then the neighbors might figure it out: ItÂ€Â™s her. All day all night I hear buzzing coming out of that apartment. No wonder sheÂ€Â™s always smiling. I might try to dispose of it with the kitchen garbage hiding it with coffee grounds and dead things from the back of the refrigerator as I do old tax reports but then IÂ€Â™d be in violation of the recycling law.         I know I know Â€Â” I should have been one of those women who held out for diamonds.         But disposing of sex paraphernalia Â€Â” actually all those embarrassing items you have stashed around the house Â€Â” is something every boomer should be concerned about. The days are dwindling down to a precious few and some of you have a nasty cough. Do you want the people clearing out your house particularly your children to find those feathery metallic rubbery polymer blend items you ordered one drunken night a few months after youÂ€Â™d been forced to take early retirement? Do you want them to know their big tough construction worker dad liked to dress up in heels and a boa and sing Â€ÂœLa La LaÂ€Âù from Â€ÂœNo StringsÂ€Âù one of Richard RodgersÂ€Â™s weaker efforts?         You may be thinking Â€ÂœWhat do I care what my friends or children find in the house? I will be beyond embarrassment I will be dead.Â€Âù But you are wrong. Doctors now know that the human sense of embarrassment can last up to two weeks after the heart stops beating. Consider this statement from a boomer named Stanley: Â€ÂœI was lying on the operating table then I had a feeling of leaving my body and looking down at myself and all I could think was Â€Â˜Is my gut really that big?Â€Â™ Â€Âù Look it up on the web.         I know no one likes to think about death. But just as the responsible person designates someone to make medical decisions in case he or she is incapacitated we should all have designated letÂ€Â™s call them Eradicators to come over and clean the house after we expire. Remember Marilyn Monroe. Not that I can prove anything just saying. Your Eradicator should be given house keys a list of items to be destroyed and their hiding places Â€Â” you donÂ€Â™t want to be in intensive care screaming Â€ÂœBack of the sock drawer!Â€Âù TheyÂ€Â™ll just increase your meds.         The truly considerate person will dispose of potentially humiliating or harmful items the moment he gets really sick like a married man I knew who gave his love letters from the other woman to a male friend before he went into the hospital. Then he got better and got the love letters back. Then he died which was a big mistake on his part though I hear it made for an interesting moment at the memorial when the widow spotted the other woman. Think of this as a cautionary tale. Horrible things can happen when you leave romantic mementos around the house.         There is no excuse however for careless or improper disposal such as my friend Herb and I were witness to many years ago in Greenwich Village when we spied a sex toy in the street Â€Â” not on the sidewalk in the street. IÂ€Â™d tell you what it was but I am trying to stay within newspaper guidelines: O.K. think adult seesaw.         Herb and I gaped long and hard at this thing first debating the anatomical possibilities (and you wonder what friends have to talk about after 40 years) then as in Â€ÂœLaw & OrderÂ€Âù trying to recreate the scene:         Had there been a loversÂ€Â™ quarrel during which this humongous shillelagh had been tossed out of a cab? If that was the case why did the couple have the thing in the cab in the first place Â€Â” stealing a kiss in the back seat is one thing but that? Had it slipped out of someoneÂ€Â™s shopping bag and then even in the Village was he or she too embarrassed to pick it up?         Awful right? And imagine how much worse it would have been if it had been spotted when I was walking with a child.         Â€ÂœWhatÂ€Â™s that thing in the street Auntie Joyce?Â€Âù         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s a grown-up thing sweetie. People buy them when they love each other very much. Or maybe not enough. One day when youÂ€Â™re grown up a man will fall in love with you. When that happens bring up diamonds.Â€Âù        70,1E+14,0,Article,News,Where Freedom of the Press Is Muffled,Business Day,1267,5.722,5.641,In  Â€ÂœInnovation thrives where people breathe freely speak freely are able to challenge orthodoxy where newspapers can report the truth without fear of consequencesÂ€Âù he said in an address to American businesspeople living and working there.

Keith Vaz a Labour Party member of the committee cut to the opposite of the chase in the middle of the session: Â€ÂœI love this country. Do you love this country?Â€Âù         Mr. Rusbridger paused less as a matter of consideration than dismay that his credentials as a citizen were of primary concern.         Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m slightly surprised to be asked the questionÂ€Âù Mr. Rusbridger said Â€Âœbut yes we are patriots and one of the things we are patriotic about is the nature of democracy the nature of a free press and the fact that one can in this country discuss and report these things.Â€Âù He later added Â€ÂœOne of the things I love about this country is that we have that freedom to write and report and to think and we have some privacy.Â€Âù         In his testimony Mr. Rusbridger pointed out that newspapers in the United States including The Washington Post and The Times had reached the same conclusion about the leaks Â€Â” that what they revealed was of vital global significance. Given that The Guardian had shared some of the Snowden material with The Times Mark Reckless another committee member asked whether The Guardian should be prosecuted for that. Â€ÂœI think it depends on your view of a free pressÂ€Âù Mr. Rusbridger responded.         Mr. Rusbridger made his own view clear: Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s self-evident. If the president of the United States calls a review of everything to do with intelligence and that information only came into the public domain through newspapers then it is self-evident is it not that newspapers had done something which oversight failed to do.Â€Âù         At the same time the British government has used the so-called  Theoretically the structure of our government is supposed to keep us safe from government abuse but the rise of an enhanced security state after the attacks of Sept. 11 2001 has created a kind of short circuit in that diagram of accountability. That is where journalism comes in where China gets it wrong where Britain has lost its footing. Transparency however painful in the moment allows democracy business and the citizenry to thrive in the long run a point that Mr. Biden made in his speech and that Mr. Rusbridger made in his testimony.         Â€ÂœThere are countries and they are not generally democracies where the press are not free to write about these things and where the security services do tell editors what to write and where politicians do censor newspapersÂ€Âù Mr. Rusbridger said. Â€ÂœThatÂ€Â™s not the country we live in in Britain.Â€Âù         By now most people know that The Guardian and The Washington Post published articles in June that set off a global debate over the implications of government surveillance and put citizens everywhere on notice that their private communications are subject to inspection by the National Security Agency. Since the leaks first surfaced there have been many new disclosures exposing fresh insults to privacy. Last week The Washington Post 66,1E+14,0,Article,News,Sake of Argument Vanishes in a Sensible B.C.S. Finale,Sports,1051,5.504,5.707,In its final season college footballÂ€Â™s beleaguered postseason system known as the  Fans pundits coaches players Â€Â” they could all but put it on the schedule. Dec. 7: conference championship games for some teams; final regular-season matchups for others. Dec. 8: Argue about rip into and generally belittle the B.C.S. a target easily and fairly among the most maligned in sports.         ItÂ€Â™s funny then how everything played out. How Auburn won a shootout with Missouri to vanquish its second top-five foe in the last two weeks. How Ohio State stumbled for the first time in two years. How Florida State bludgeoned another overmatched opponent.         Where chaos was expected there was peace.         As those three games barreled toward their conclusions Saturday it became clear that this seasonÂ€Â™s national championship would be created without controversy. The same could be said for the most part for all of this seasonÂ€Â™s B.C.S. selections. The same could be said for many years of the B.C.S. standings despite all the ridicule lobbed at the selection process.         So Florida State will meet Auburn in January in Pasadena Calif. with the national championship at stake. This is the game almost everybody wanted Â€Â” everybody that is outside Ohio the home of the Buckeyes. Just as the Seminoles tangled with a Southeastern Conference team (Tennessee) for the inaugural B.C.S. title in the 1998 season they will do so again for the final one.         Â€ÂœWhat a final season for the B.C.S.Â€Âù said a giddy Bill Hancock the organizationÂ€Â™s executive director on a conference call late Sunday.         He added Â€ÂœThere was some nostalgia around here today.Â€Âù         Hancock naturally focused on the times the B.C.S.Â€Â™s convoluted formula worked out. He cited one of his favorite statistics: that in the 56 years before the B.C.S. the top two teams in the country squared off in a bowl game eight times. In 16 years of the B.C.S. the top two teams in the organizationÂ€Â™s standings met at the end of each season and the Associated Press top 25 poll agreed on 13 occasions Hancock said.         Â€ÂœWeÂ€Â™ve gotten it right way more times than weÂ€Â™ve created controversyÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœI find it interesting that people tend to focus on the times weÂ€Â™ve had debate.Â€Âù         Regardless change is coming; next year college football will introduce a four-team playoff system. In future years that system is very likely to be expanded at least to eight teams. And yet while the postseason itself will change for good in about a month the final pairing also felt familiar.         The state of Alabama will have yet another representative in the championship bout for the fifth straight year. The SEC the conference that spawned the winners of the previous seven national titles (including Auburn for the 2010 season) will be gunning for an eighth straight.         If destiny factors at all into the results of sporting events if you believe in lucky bounces and momentum and whatever cannot easily be explained then both teams can lay claim to the D-word in their own way.         For Auburn there was the late touchdown pass against Georgia that deflected off a defenderÂ€Â™s hands. There was the field goal that Alabama missed at the end of the Iron Bowl that AuburnÂ€Â™s Chris Davis raced from his own end zone into college football lore. Then there was SaturdayÂ€Â™s SEC title game against Missouri secured by Auburn with 59 points.         For Florida State destiny was dominance not thrilling victories in the closing seconds.         The Seminoles crushed Duke on Saturday in the Atlantic Coast Conference title game much as they crushed every team their schedule placed in front of them. They outscored teams by an average of 42.3 points and won 12 games by at least 27 and another by 14.         In their locker room afterward talk had already turned toward Auburn and toward the SEC the recent undisputed king of college football conferences. Jimbo Fisher the Florida State coach with SEC roots expanded on his time as the quarterbacks coach at Auburn and the 1993 season when the Tigers finished undefeated.        78,1E+14,0,Article,Obituary (Obit),"Fred F. Scherer, Diorama Painter Who Mastered Even the Illusion of Air, Dies at 98",N.Y. / Region,803,5.598,5.919,In the memory of every schoolchild who has been marched through the  Fred F. Scherer who died at 98 on Nov. 25 in Townshend Vt. painted many of those landscapes.         Their purpose curving along the back walls of the dioramas was to cast a spell over the foreground of stuffed bears and eagles fake trees and grass Â€Â” to make everything hold together like a slice of wilderness encased in glass. And from 1934 to 1972 Mr. Scherer painted or collaborated in painting several dozen of those scenes.         He specialized in avian wildlife but was also known for his bison antelope deer and black-and-white colobus monkeys Â€Â” all that despite having had no formal art training when he became an apprentice at 19 to a scenery maker on the museumÂ€Â™s diorama staff.         His working life as a kind of trompe lÂ€Â™oeil specialist overlapped the height of diorama art in America when lifelike re-creations of white rhinoceroses on the savanna or elk herds in the foothills of the Rockies could still evince a jaw-dropping response from a pre-television museumgoer.         Mr. Scherer produced the bulk of his work from the 1940s to the 1960s when diorama art fell out of fashion among curators said Stephen C. Quinn a museum artist and the author of Â€ÂœWindows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural HistoryÂ€Âù (2006).         When Mr. Scherer graduated to painting he was mentored by James Perry Wilson a resident landscape artist who became well known for his gallery paintings.         Â€ÂœIn the heyday the diorama was a real experience for most people the original virtual reality experienceÂ€Âù Mr. Quinn said.         The goal of those who conceived the dioramas he said was quasi-religious. Gazing at the displays he said city dwellers who might never see a flock of cormorants nesting on cliffs overlooking the ocean an eagle at rest on a mountain ledge above the tree line or a red-throated loon breakfasting on the shore of a glass-still lake at first light Â€Â” all scenes Mr. Scherer painted Â€Â” could nevertheless experience Â€Âœa communion with nature.Â€Âù         Probably Mr. SchererÂ€Â™s best known work is the antelope-dotted pastel-colored plain he created in 1942 with Mr. Wilson for the diorama Â€ÂœAmerican Bison and Pronghorn AntelopeÂ€Âù considered one of the museumÂ€Â™s best.         Diorama painting demands a unique combination of skills Mr. Quinn said. The hue and texture of two-dimensional wildlife in the background have to fit seamlessly with the three-dimensional taxidermy and synthetic vegetation rocks and trees in the foreground. Linear perspectives have to be adjusted for the curve of the back wall.         And more imperceptibly there has to be a lot of depth and substance to the airspace of the picture Â€Â” an illusion of odors bugs and many miles of air currents in the 20 to 30 feet between the back wall and the spectatorÂ€Â™s glass. Mr. Scherer was a master of all those illusions especially air Mr. Quinn said.         In an interview with The Brattleboro Reformer in Vermont Mr. Scherer gave a summary of his technique: Â€ÂœI would juxtapose warm and cool colors to give it more airlike qualitiesÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s painted that way to vibrate like air in the distance does.Â€Âù         Frederick Frank Scherer was born in Queens on March 1 1915 the eighth of nine children of William and Mary Ellen Scherer. (The ninth was his twin Robert who died several years ago.) His father worked as a printer.         Mr. Scherer had four children from a previous marriage: his daughters Deidre Scherer who confirmed the death and Janice-Ellen Scherer-Dufner and his sons William and Gregory. They survive him along with his wife Cicely Aikman Scherer; another daughter Kim Scherer; a stepson Paul Breslin and 14 grandchildren.         Though he drew from a young age Mr. Scherer had no plans for a career in art until a neighbor who was a carpenter at the Museum of Natural History told him that his bosses were looking for artists Deidre Scherer said. For the job interview he brought along a polar bear model he made just for the occasion. He got the job.         Growing up Ms. Scherer said she and her siblings sometimes visited their father at the museum when he was at work on a diorama in the Â€ÂœAnd you could walk right into this other worldÂ€Âù she said Â€Âœlike magic.Â€Âù        101,1E+14,0,Article,News,Flea Theater Gets a Place to Call Home,Theater,786,5.381,5.859,In the post-Sept. 11 devastation when Lower Manhattan was effectively shut down and New Yorkers stayed home the Flea thought its days as an Off Off Broadway theater were over.         The converted TriBeCa factory where shows were staged was off limits so performances had to be canceled. Its founders Â€Â” including the artistic director  Yet the Flea persevered and even managed to thrive. And on Thursday the theater started construction on its first permanent home an $18.5 million project at 20 Thomas Street in TriBeCa that will feature three performance spaces along with offices and costume and scene shops.         The cost includes the renovation of a 1791 building which the Flea bought for $5.3 million in 2010 with contributions and a loan that it paid back within a year. The city provided $5 million the state $3.75 million and private donors gave $8.25 million.         Wearing a hard hat at the groundbreaking ceremony Kate Levin the cityÂ€Â™s cultural affairs commissioner pronounced the project Â€Âœgroovy doovyÂ€Âù Â€Â” a phrase she attributed to Mr. Simpson.         He and Ms. Weaver made an undisclosed six-figure donation to the project and the smallest of its spaces at 44 seats will be called the Siggy in Ms. WeaverÂ€Â™s honor. (Â€ÂœThe little goblin spaceÂ€Âù she called it in an interview.) The largest auditorium seating 120 will be named the Sam after the theater agent Sam Cohn.

Â€ÂœThe Flea gave me the opportunity to experiment which I hadnÂ€Â™t had in a long timeÂ€Âù he added. Â€ÂœI had a whole new life down there Â€Â” and still do.Â€Âù         The Flea began planning for change in 2006 realizing it had outgrown the 74- and 40-seat theaters at its White Street home where the rent had become too expensive Â€Â” $17000 from the original $3000.         By then a once-scrappy endeavor had professionalized.         Mr. Simpson and Ms. Weaver Â€Â” who met at the Williamstown Theater Festival in 1982 and married two years later Â€Â” founded the theater with two friends. They had no board no fund-raisers no strategic plan.         After Sept. 11 the Flea created a board of directors that now numbers 20 and hired Carol Ostrow as producing director. She had had a similar job at the much larger Classic Stage Company and knew Mr. Simpson from Yale Drama School.         Yet the young acting troupe known as  Â€ÂœI always feel honored to work with the BatsÂ€Âù Ms. Weaver said. Â€ÂœThey go for it those guys.Â€Âù         Recent Bats productions include Sean GraneyÂ€Â™s  Mr. Simpson said he had made a concerted effort to build a diverse company of actors; more than half of the 130 Bats are nonwhite. Â€ÂœIt isnÂ€Â™t something that takes care of itself unless you really search for it activelyÂ€Âù he said.         This progressive spirit is integral to the Flea. Every member of every production is expected to pitch in Â€Â” from washing costumes to replacing toilet paper in the restrooms. About half of the audience is under 35. There is no set number of shows each season. Performances are given only five days a week to allow the actors Â€Âœto have a lifeÂ€Âù Mr. Simpson said; rehearsals are scheduled around their day jobs.         The FleaÂ€Â™s founders plan to maintain this sense of nimbleness in their new home which they hope to open in 2015. The complex designed by ARO (Architecture Research Office) will not be some bright and shiny version of the Flea but more of a continuation. The stacking chairs from the existing theater are coming along Â€Â” with a few more added. The operating budget will increase only slightly to $1.45 million from $1.2 million; the full-time staff to 10 from 8.         The new home a former hospital is wide enough to allow for more than one stage entrance.

Now her conflict with Gov. Mike Pence a conservative former congressman has become one of the most public and combative political fights to face his new administration.         Ms. Ritz has accused the governor of creating a new education agency to undermine her office. Mr. Pence says that was not his aim. But the tension months in the making has boiled over at monthly State Board of Education meetings where Ms. Ritz and board members who are appointed by the governor continue to wrestle for control over the stateÂ€Â™s education policies.         In recent weeks Ms. Ritz the state superintendent of public instruction has sued the board walked out of a meeting to prevent a vote and accused Mr. Pence of orchestrating a subversive Â€Âœpower grabÂ€Âù against the Department of Education.         Â€ÂœI feel he wants to have one agency for education and thatÂ€Â™s going to be the agencyÂ€Âù she said in a recent interview about the governorÂ€Â™s new agency the  The center with fewer than 20 staff members was created by Mr. PenceÂ€Â™s executive order with the broad mission of better aligning the stateÂ€Â™s K-12 higher education and work force development strategies according to Claire Fiddian-Green a co-director of the center and a special assistant to the governor. The center also provides staffing for the Board of Education which previously relied on Ms. RitzÂ€Â™s 228 employees at the Department of Education for legal counsel and administrative support.         Critics have called the agency unneeded and its purpose unclear a layer of bureaucracy added by a governor who typically favors small government. But board members said the move was necessary accusing the superintendent of dragging her feet on issues that she campaigned against like a new performance grading system for schools.         Â€ÂœIf youÂ€Â™re opposed to something youÂ€Â™re not going to administer it with vigilance and enthusiasmÂ€Âù said Daniel J. Elsener a board member who was reappointed by Mr. Pence in June and has complained about Ms. Ritz to the governorÂ€Â™s staff.         Ms. Ritz a political newcomer and former school librarian was elected in November 2012 with the help of teachers outraged with the incumbent superintendent Tony Bennett who pushed to expand voucher programs and test-based accountability for public schools. Mr. Bennett  Mr. Pence a favorite among social and fiscal conservatives was also elected in 2012 and has made improving the link between education and the job market part of his plan for the state. Late last week he announced a proposal to expand IndianaÂ€Â™s school voucher program already among the broadest in the nation which Ms. Ritz  The first sign of a divorce between the Department of Education and the board came in May when Mr. Pence signed a larger spending bill that separated the two bodies. When he created C.E.C.I. in August Ms. Ritz said she learned about the initiative on the day of the announcement despite having met with the governor just days before.         Â€ÂœThe governor is trying to act like heÂ€Â™s out of the frayÂ€Âù said Brian Howey the editor of Howey Politics Indiana a newsletter. Â€ÂœBut at the same time his appointees are doing all this maneuvering.Â€Âù Mr. Howey also said Democrats may use the feud to fuel supporters in some 2014 legislative elections.         Defending himself last month in an  Mr. Pence also expressed Â€Âœregret that the Department of Education and the superintendent have misunderstood my sincere desire to work with them on behalf of all the children of Indiana.Â€Âù         Still an  Ms. Ritz and Mr. Pence met in private last month agreeing to let the  In Indiana governors appoint all 10 members of the Board of Education which has final say on K-12 policy. But the state is one of 12 that do not have an appointed superintendent according to the national association.

Last month the confrontation grew when board members sought to vote on a resolution that would have given their staff at C.E.C.I. a larger role in evaluating academic standards that will be adopted next year. Ms. Ritz who said it was her departmentÂ€Â™s job to evaluate the standards declared the resolution Â€ÂœimproperÂ€Âù saying it violated state statute and ended the meeting abruptly.

But what kind of disaster was it? Was it a failure of management messing up the initial implementation of a fundamentally sound policy? Or was it a demonstration that the Affordable Care Act is inherently unworkable?         We know what each side of the partisan divide wants you to believe. The Obama administration is telling the public that everything will eventually be fixed and urging Congressional Democrats to keep their nerve. Republicans on the other hand are declaring the program an irredeemable failure which must be scrapped and replaced with ... well they donÂ€Â™t really want to replace it with anything.         At a time like this you really want a controlled experiment. What would happen if we unveiled a program that looked like Obamacare in a place that looked like America but with competent project management that produced a working website?         Well your wish is granted. Ladies and gentlemen I give you California.         Now California isnÂ€Â™t the only place where Obamacare is looking pretty good. A number of states that are running their own online health exchanges instead of relying on HealthCare.gov are doing well. KentuckyÂ€Â™s Kynect is a huge success; so is Access Health CT in Connecticut.  California is however an especially useful test case. First of all itÂ€Â™s huge: if a system can work for 38 million people it can work for America as a whole. Also itÂ€Â™s hard to argue that California has had any special advantages other than that of having a government that actually wants to help the uninsured. When Massachusetts put Romneycare into effect it already had a relatively low number of uninsured residents. California however came into health reform with 22 percent of its nonelderly population Finally the California authorities have been especially forthcoming with  For one thing enrollment is surging. At this point more than 10000 applications are being completed per day putting the state well on track to meet its overall targets for 2014 coverage. Just imagine by the way how different press coverage would be right now if Obama officials had produced a comparable success and around 100000 people a day were signing up nationwide.         Equally important is the information on who is enrolling. To work as planned health reform has to produce a balanced risk pool Â€Â” that is it must sign up young healthy Americans as well as their older less healthy compatriots. And so far so good: in October 22.5 percent of California enrollees were between the ages of 18 and 34 slightly above that groupÂ€Â™s share of the population.         What we have in California then is a proof of concept. Yes Obamacare is workable Â€Â” in fact done right it works just fine.         The bad news of course is that most Americans arenÂ€Â™t lucky enough to live in states in which Obamacare has in fact been done right. TheyÂ€Â™re stuck either with HealthCare.gov or with one of the state exchanges like OregonÂ€Â™s that have similar or worse problems. Will they ever get to experience successful health reform?         The answer is probably yes. There wonÂ€Â™t be a moment when the clouds suddenly lift but the exchanges are gradually getting better Â€Â” a point inadvertently illustrated a few days ago by John Boehner the speaker of the House. Mr. Boehner staged a publicity stunt in which he  And maybe the transaction would have proceeded faster if Mr. BoehnerÂ€Â™s office hadnÂ€Â™t according to the D.C. exchange put its agent Â€Â” who was calling to help finish the enrollment Â€Â”  There will also probably be growing use of workarounds Â€Â” for example encouraging people to go directly to insurers. This will temporarily defeat one of the purposes of the exchanges which was to make price comparisons easy but it will be good enough as a short-term patch. And one shouldnÂ€Â™t forget that the insurance industry has a big financial stake in the success of Obamacare and will soon be pitching in with big efforts to sign people up.         Again ObamacareÂ€Â™s rollout was a disaster. But in California we can see what health reform will look like beyond the glitches. And itÂ€Â™s going to work.        67,1E+14,1,Article,News,"At $142.4 Million, Triptych Is the Most Expensive Artwork Ever Sold at an Auction",Arts,963,5.547,5.81,It took seven superrich bidders to propel a 1969 Francis Bacon triptych to $142.4 million at ChristieÂ€Â™s on Tuesday night making it the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction. William Acquavella the New York dealer is thought to have bought the painting on behalf of an unidentified client from one of ChristieÂ€Â™s skyboxes overlooking the auction.         The price for the painting which depicts Lucian Freud BaconÂ€Â™s friend and rival perched on a wooden chair was more than the $85 million ChristieÂ€Â™s had estimated. It also toppled the previous record set in May 2012 when Edvard MunchÂ€Â™s fabled pastel of Â€ÂœThe ScreamÂ€Âù sold at SothebyÂ€Â™s for $119.9 million and broke the previous record for the artist at auction set at the peak of the market in May 2008 when SothebyÂ€Â™s sold a triptych from 1976 to the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich for $86.2 million.         When the bidding for Â€ÂœThree Studies of Lucian FreudÂ€Âù finally stopped after more than 10 fraught minutes the overflowing crowd in the salesroom burst into applause. Two disappointed bidders could be seen leaving the room. Â€ÂœI went to $101 million but it hardly matteredÂ€Âù said Larry Gagosian the super-dealer who was trying to buy the painting on behalf of a client. Another contender was Hong Gyu Shin the director of the Shin Gallery on Grand Street in Manhattan who said he was bidding for himself.         Â€ÂœI was expecting it to go for around $87 millionÂ€Âù Mr. Shin said. Although he explained that he collects mostly Japanese woodblock prints and old master paintings he found the triptych by the Irish-born painter who died in 1992 irresistible. Â€ÂœI loved that painting and I couldnÂ€Â™t control myselfÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœMaybe someday IÂ€Â™ll have another chance.Â€Âù         For more than a month now ChristieÂ€Â™s has been billing the sale as a landmark event with a greater number of paintings and sculptures estimated to sell for over $20 million than it has ever had before. The hard sell apparently worked. Nearly 10000 visitors flocked to its galleries to preview the auction. The sale totaled $691.5 million far above ChristieÂ€Â™s $670.4 million high estimate becoming the most expensive auction ever. It outstripped the $495 million total set at ChristieÂ€Â™s in May.         Of the 69 works on offer only six failed to sell. All told 10 world record prices were achieved for artists who besides Bacon included Christopher Wool Ad Reinhardt Donald Judd and Willem de Kooning.         The sale was also a place to see and be seen. ChristieÂ€Â™s Rockefeller Center salesroom was standing room only with collectors including Michael Ovitz the Los Angeles talent agent; Aby Rosen the New York real estate developer; Martin Margulies from Miami; Donald B. Marron the New York financier; and Daniel S. Loeb the activist investor and hedge fund manager.         The Bacon triptych was not the only highflier. A 10-foot-tall mirror-polished stainless steel sculpture that resembled a childÂ€Â™s party favor Jeff KoonsÂ€Â™s Â€ÂœBalloon Dog (Orange)Â€Âù sold to another telephone bidder for $58.4 million above its high $55 million estimate becoming the most expensive work by a living artist sold at auction. The pooch was being sold by Peter M. Brant the newsprint magnate who auctioned the canine to raise money to endow his Greenwich Conn. foundation. In the 1990s Mr. Koons had created the sculpture in an edition of five each in a different color. Four celebrated collectors own the others: Steven A. Cohen the hedge-fund billionaire has a yellow one; Eli Broad the Los Angeles financier owns a blue one; FranÃƒÂ§ois Pinault the French luxury goods magnate and owner of ChristieÂ€Â™s has the magenta version; and Dakis Joannou the Greek industrialist has his in red. ChristieÂ€Â™s had estimated Mr. BrantÂ€Â™s sculpture would fetch $35 million to $55 million.         (Final prices include the buyerÂ€Â™s premium: 25 percent of the first $100000; 20 percent of the next $100000 to $2 million; and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)         Another strong price was set for a classic image in contemporary art history Â€Â” Andy WarholÂ€Â™s Â€ÂœCoca Cola [3]Â€Âù one of only four paintings of a single Coca-Cola bottle that the artist made in 1961 and 1962. Jose Mugrabi the New York dealer bought the painting from S. I. Newhouse Jr. in 1986 and he was said to be selling it on Tuesday night. That painting made $57.2 million. It had been estimated to sell for $40 million to $60 million.         Three bidders went for RothkoÂ€Â™s Â€ÂœNo. 11 (Untitled)Â€Âù one of the artistÂ€Â™s abstract canvases this one in an orange palette and created in 1957. It was being sold by the estate of Bruce J. Wasserstein the financier who died in 2009. Christophe van de Weghe a Manhattan dealer bought the painting for $46 million above its high $35 million estimate. Mr. van de Weghe also bought Â€ÂœApocalypse NowÂ€Âù a seminal painting by Mr. Wool whose work is currently the subject of a major retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum. Bidding on behalf of a client he paid $26.4 million for the painting. Created in 1988 the white canvas is filled with the words Â€ÂœSell the House Sell the Car Sell the KidsÂ€Âù a line from the Francis Ford Coppola movie of the same title. The painting belonged to David Ganek the former New York hedge fund manager and Guggenheim board member. Mr. Ganek has since resigned from the board.         After the sale Jussi PylkkÃƒÂ_nen chairman of ChristieÂ€Â™s Europe and the eveningÂ€Â™s auctioneer noted how international the bidding was. Besides a healthy showing of American bidders there were also a lot of potential buyers from Asia and Europe trying to get into the action. Â€ÂœThere were more players from the New World than ever beforeÂ€Âù he said Â€Âœand more people spending over $20 million.         Â€ÂœButÂ€Âù he warned in order to have such a successful sale Â€Âœyou have to have the material.Â€Âù        152,1E+14,0,Article,News,Column: Road to Super Bowl Still Through Seattle,Sports,796,5.029,5.683,"It was the kind of a game deserving of the burgeoning rivalry a chippy affair very much in doubt until Frank Gore ripped off a run that saved some self-respect if not the season for the San Francisco 49ers.         Allowing the Seattle Seahawks to embarrass them once this season was bad enough. Allowing them to celebrate winning the NFC West title in one of the final games at creaky old Candlestick Park just might have pushed Jim Harbaugh and his charges over the edge.         The 49ers have struggled against playoff-bound teams all season yet somehow found a way to pull out this one. Scoring three points in the second half isn't usually a recipe for winning teams but on Sunday the 19-17 victory was just enough to keep San Francisco solidly in the playoff hunt.         It made for smiles all around even from the perennially cranky Harbaugh. But even the best win of the year for the 49ers didn't change one inescapable fact:         The road to a second straight  ""If we keep doing our thing and they keep doing their thing no question"" Gore said about the prospects of a January visit to Seattle.         So far this season the Seahawks aren't just unbeaten at home. They look unbeatable at home including a 29-3 win in September where Colin Kaepernick was so bewildered by the noise and Seattle's defense that he threw three interceptions and lost a fumble.         It wasn't much prettier last December at CenturyLink Field when the Seahawks won 42-13 against a team that was headed to the Super Bowl. By contrast Seattle or any other team in the West hasn't won in San Francisco since 2008 a streak that continued Sunday when Gore rumbled for 51 yards to set up a field goal with 26 seconds left to win the game.         None of that seemed to matter much to the 49ers after pulling off a game that they desperately needed to win if they were going to have any hopes of regaining at least some bragging rights in a division they won the last two seasons. Seattle will almost surely break that run this season but at 9-4 and playing about as well as they have all year the 49ers are in good position to join them in the playoffs.         ""We're playing for our lives"" receiver Anquan Boldin said. ""We're playing playoff football right now. It's win or go home.""         Not quite but it's getting close. And losing at home to Seattle might have been a killer blow psychologically if not mathematically to the 49ers.         ""I don't know if it was their Super Bowl but they played a great game"" Seahawks defensive end Red Bryant said.         They also talked a great game. There's no love lost between the teams and it showed with players jabbering at each other after plays and referees quick to step between. Both quarterbacks played respectably but neither got to 200 yards passing and in the second half defense dominated on both teams.         Gore said before the game that the 49ers had to run the ball better to win and took things into his own hands with 110 yards on the ground including the big run that rescued San Francisco just when it looked as if Seattle would hold on to win.         ""We didn't project it to be this way"" Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman said. ""We expected to blow them out but they got the benefit of a few calls tonight throughout the game and that helps you especially on third down. We will see them again and it will be a different result.""         Sherman likes to talk of course and has done his part to add to the animosity between the two teams. He doesn't get along with Harbaugh his former coach at Stanford and he isn't afraid to stir things up either on or off the field.         But he plays for a team that can back up his words. The Seahawks took apart a good New Orleans team at home Monday night then traveled to their division rivals and almost pulled off a win at a place where opposing teams in the West just don't win.         They're 11-2 with games against the Giants Cardinals and Rams left and they seem perfectly set up for a deep run in the playoffs. They'll almost certainly have a first-round bye and home-field advantage in the loudest stadium in the NFL Â€Â” and perhaps the world Â€Â” where they have yet to lose all season.         Despite the loss the road to the Super Bowl still goes through Seattle. And the Seahawks remain in the driver's seat.         ___        "115,1E+14,1,Article,News,A Lost Boy Grows Up,Magazine,742,5.313,5.389,Jacob Deng Mach stood 25 yards from a row of torso-shaped targets his hands numb and twitchy in the March morning chill. It had been seven months since he entered AtlantaÂ€Â™s police academy and things were not going so well. Despite three days of practice he had failed on each of his first four tries to pass the firearms qualifying test and his scores were largely trending in the wrong direction.         Jacob knew that if he did not pass the test twice he would have to start over and repeat the entire grueling curriculum. If he then failed the firearms test again he would be dismissed from the academy altogether quashing perhaps his best shot at an unlikely ascension from war-ravaged  Jacob who is 33 had been shot at plenty of times as a boy. But he had never handled a gun before joining the academy and he was proving largely immune to instruction. All elbows and knees he lacked the fluid coordination of more athletic recruits and sometimes struggled to unholster his weapon or to get shots off in time. He confused sequences of commands paused inexplicably before reloading even fired occasionally at the wrong targets.         The instructor positioned behind him a former Marine named Jason Overbaugh grew so exasperated that he literally threw up his hands. Â€ÂœMach you cannot follow simple instructions sonÂ€Âù Overbaugh told him. Â€ÂœI canÂ€Â™t say it any other different way. ThatÂ€Â™s why youÂ€Â™re screwing this up.Â€Âù         A more seasoned academy hand Officer Meredith Crowder sensed that Overbaugh and Jacob needed a break from each other and suggested she give it a try. With her set jaw and spiky hair Crowder could be as hard-nosed as any academy instructor. But she had developed an easy rapport with Jacob over the months and she figured a familiar touch might help. She started by rubbing his back and then spoke to him in a soothing voice.         Â€ÂœNow you were chased by lions and tigers right?Â€Âù she began in her West Georgia twang.         Jacob grinned. The part about the lions was right enough and he was too preoccupied to explain that there are no tigers in Africa. Â€ÂœYes maÂ€Â™amÂ€Âù he said.         Â€ÂœSoÂ€Âù the instructor cocked her head Â€Âœwhat is the big deal with this?Â€Âù         Jacob realized that Officer Crowder had a point. He certainly had overcome more. There was the death of his father a rebel soldier in the Sudanese civil war; the bombardment of his village by government tanks and planes; the barefoot trek at age 7 along with thousands of other tiny refugees to a camp in Ethiopia; the loss of comrades to lions in the bush and crocodiles in the Gilo River; the starvation so severe that he ate leaves and watched friends drink their own urine.         He lost track of his mother for four years after new strife forced the boys to flee on foot back to southern Sudan. At 12 he had to escape the shooting again this time hiking to the Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya where he managed for 10 years on one meal a day. In 2001 after the United States granted refugee status to nearly 4000 people who had been christened the Lost Boys of Sudan Jacob was deposited in a drab apartment in Clarkston Ga. just outside Atlanta. He arrived at age 21 with one change of clothes and a three-month guarantee of government support. There he confronted an alien world of flush toilets and microwave ovens of impenetrable job applications and accents barely recognizable as English.         It did not take long for Jacob to realize that the streets were not in fact paved with gold. Â€ÂœAll I knew was that America was the greatest thing in the worldÂ€Âù he recalled. Â€ÂœNobody knew how people struggle in America.Â€Âù         This new life would require new thinking. There was no such thing as ambition back in the village where each generation of boys tended their familiesÂ€Â™ cattle and crops just as the last did. But in Georgia Jacob felt he had little choice but to buy fully into the American dream. Traversing AtlantaÂ€Â™s sprawl by bus and train and foot he worked the evening shift at a Publix unpacking produce and then the night shift at a Hilton stocking minibars at $7.50 an hour. He often found no more than four hours for sleep and snatched naps when he could. Once regrettably it was while he was stopped at a red light behind a bus and his foot slipped off the brake.        136,1E+14,0,Article,Obituary (Obit),"Jean-Claude Beton, Who Gave Orangina Its Signature Bottle, Dies at 88",Business Day,495,5.813,5.648,Jean-Claude Beton who transformed  His death was announced by Mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin of Marseille where Mr. Beton moved the headquarters of the company from Algeria in the early 1960s.         Mr. BetonÂ€Â™s father LÃƒÂ©on a Frenchman living in Algeria bought the formula for what was then called Naranjina in 1935 from a Spanish pharmacist who came up with its blend of citrus juices carbonated water sugar and other ingredients. Jean-Claude Beton who took over the company in 1947 insisted that the drink a sensible but sophisticated precursor to artisanal soft drinks like Izze and Jones Soda remain largely the same: a fresh uncola with European appeal.         In 1951 Mr. Beton introduced OranginaÂ€Â™s 8-ounce glass bottle shaped and textured to simulate an orange. Even in an era of supersizing the small bottle has remained OranginaÂ€Â™s signature.         Â€ÂœIt was madness to have these bottles madeÂ€Âù Mr. Breton said in  The pulpy cloud inside has also endured.         Â€ÂœAn advertising guy told me there was a weakness and weÂ€Â™re going to make a strength out of this weakness by saying Â€Â˜The bottle needs to be shakenÂ€Â™Ã‚Â Â€Âù he said. Â€ÂœTelevision offered an opportunity to shake things.Â€Âù         Mr. Beton who moved the company to Marseille as Algeria was establishing its independence from France supported imaginative marketing techniques including the orange-peel sunshade that was part of OranginaÂ€Â™s early logo; television commercials showing bartenders comically shaking the bottle; and grand public displays like the 75-foot bottle of Orangina erected outside the Porte Maillot MÃƒÂ©tro station in Paris in 1986 the sodaÂ€Â™s 50th anniversary.         Orangina was introduced to the United States in 1978 originally under the name Orelia. Beginning in the 1980s it moved through a series of owners and partnerships as it expanded around the world. In the late Â€Â™90s French regulators and the company fought off takeover bids by Coca-Cola. It is now part of Suntory of Japan.         Over the years Orangina has added new containers including cans and plastic bottles. For many years it contained at least 25 percent orange juice but the company now says it contains Â€Âœno less thanÂ€Âù 12 percent juice with most of it coming from oranges.         Mr. Beton was born on Jan. 14 1925 in Algeria. After he sold his ownership in Orangina in the early Â€Â™80s he bought a winery ChÃƒÂ¢teau Grand Ormeaux in the Bordeaux region of France.         Information on survivors was not immediately available.         Â€ÂœOrangina is the champagne of soft drinksÂ€Âù Mr. Breton said in 2009. Â€ÂœIt doesnÂ€Â™t contain added colorants. It was and still is slightly sparkling. It had a little bulby bottle.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m very keen on itÂ€Âù he said of the bottle because Â€Âœit has a waist like a wasp and the bottom of a princess.Â€Âù        36,1E+14,1,Article,News,Mandelaâ€™s Death Leaves South Africa Without Its Moral Center,World,695,5.544,5.464,JOHANNESBURG Â€Â” Nelson Mandela South AfricaÂ€Â™s first black president and an enduring icon of the struggle against racial oppression died on Thursday the government announced leaving the nation without its moral center at a time of growing dissatisfaction with the countryÂ€Â™s leaders.         Â€ÂœOur nation has lost its greatest sonÂ€Âù President Jacob Zuma said in a televised address late Thursday night adding that Mr. Mandela had died at 8:50 p.m. local time. Â€ÂœHis tireless struggle for freedom earned him the respect of the world. His humility his compassion and his humanity earned him their love.Â€Âù         Mr. Zuma called Mr. MandelaÂ€Â™s death Â€Âœthe moment of our deepest sorrowÂ€Âù and said that South AfricaÂ€Â™s thoughts were now with the former presidentÂ€Â™s family. Â€ÂœThey have sacrificed much and endured much so that our people could be freeÂ€Âù he said.         Mr. Mandela spent 27 years in prison after being convicted of treason by the white minority government only to forge a peaceful end to white rule by negotiating with his captors after his release in 1990. He led the African National Congress long a banned liberation movement to a resounding electoral victory in 1994 the first fully democratic election in the countryÂ€Â™s history.         Mr. Mandela who was 95 served just one term as South AfricaÂ€Â™s president and had not been seen in public since 2010 when the nation hosted the soccer World Cup. But his decades in prison and his insistence on forgiveness over vengeance made him a potent symbol of the struggle to end this countryÂ€Â™s brutally codified system of racial domination and of the power of peaceful resolution in even the most intractable conflicts.         Years after he retreated from public life his name still resonated as an emblem of his effort to transcend decades of racial division and create what South Africans called a Rainbow Nation.         Â€ÂœHis commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him set an example that all humanity should aspire toÂ€Âù a grim President Obama said Thursday evening describing Mr. Mandela as an Â€Âœinfluential courageous and profoundly goodÂ€Âù man who inspired millions Â€Â” including himself Â€Â” to a spirit of reconciliation.         Mr. Mandela and Mr. Obama both served as the first black leaders of their nations and both men won the Nobel Peace Prize. But the American president has shied away from comparisons often noting that his own sacrifices would never compare to the ones that Mr. Mandela endured.         Mr. Obama said that the world would Â€Âœnot likely see the likes of Nelson Mandela againÂ€Âù and he noted that the former South African president had once said that he was Â€Âœnot a saint unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.Â€Âù         Mr. Zuma did not announce the specific cause of Mr. MandelaÂ€Â™s death but he had battling pneumonia and other lung ailments for the past six months and had been in and out of the hospital. Though his death was announced close to midnight when most in this nation of early risers are asleep a small crowd quickly gathered outside the house where he once lived in Soweto on Vilekazi Street.         Â€ÂœNelson Mandela there is no one like youÂ€Âù they sang stamping their feet in unison to a praise song usually sung in joy. But in the midnight darkness sadness tinged the melody.

During a one-day trip to meet with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran President Hamid Karzai not only got a chance to reach out to a neighbor but also to tweak the Western allies he has been at loggerheads with in recent weeks.         While Mr. Karzai and his staff have repeatedly said the intent is eventually to sign the bilateral security pact with the United States allowing an American troop presence beyond the 2014 withdrawal deadline Mr. Karzai has also added conditions before he signs it. Both American and Afghan officials see the chances of a completed deal by yearÂ€Â™s end as basically dead despite a recent vote by an assembly of Afghan leadership figures instructing Mr. Karzai to sign it.         Now with the deadlock continuing Mr. Karzai has publicly focused on bolstering regional ties. In addition to the Iran trip he recently met with Prime Minister Nawaz Shari of Pakistan and in coming days is to travel to India.         And while he has not explicitly been seeking an endorsement of refusal to sign the American security deal he still received one on Sunday. President Rouhani who is in the midst of delicate nuclear negotiations with Western nations explicitly said he viewed the continuing presence of foreign forces in the region as a danger.         Â€ÂœWe are concerned about the tensions arising from the presence of foreign forces in the region and believe that all foreign forces should exit the region and AfghanistanÂ€Â™s security should be ceded to the people of that countryÂ€Âù Mr. Rouhani said.         Mr. RouhaniÂ€Â™s statement was a bit of a departure from the official Iranian line on Afghan deals with the United States. In general Iranian officials while expressing discomfort with the American troop presence next door have stated publicly and repeatedly that Afghanistan is a sovereign country able to sign pacts with any other nation.         In describing the mutual deal that Iran and Afghanistan will now explore Mr. KarzaiÂ€Â™s spokesman Aimal Faizi described it as a Â€Âœpact of friendship and cooperationÂ€Âù much like understandings that Afghanistan has signed with India France and Italy.         While such pacts are to some extent symbolic they provide the basis for more extensive involvement. For instance India is providing intensive training for Afghan military personnel in counterinsurgency techniques is training members of the Afghan civil service and has made room for several thousand Afghan students in its universities.         Â€ÂœThis pact will include political security cooperation and economic developmentÂ€Âù Mr. Faizi said.         Since trade with Iran is still constrained by international sanctions because of the countryÂ€Â™s nuclear program it is unclear what kind of economic cooperation would be possible. And while the United States gave limited short-term sanction relief to Iran as The two presidents as well as the Iranian foreign minister also discussed problems faced by Afghans in Iran including peremptory deportations limits on visas and difficulties obtaining residence permits. Officials said the Iranian leadership agreed to work closely with the Afghan Foreign Ministry to improve the situation.         According to a recent Human Rights Watch report there at least two million undocumented Afghans in Iran beyond the 800000 officially registered. Most are there seeking better economic circumstances though they often face arbitrary abuse.         With such issues in common Mr. KarzaiÂ€Â™s outreach to Mr. Rouhani seemed at least in part a recognition that the United States and European countries are far away and that Afghanistan for better or worse has to deal its powerful neighbors.         Â€ÂœOur relations with Iran will not effect our relations with the United StatesÂ€Âù Mr. Faizi said. Â€ÂœWe need to enhance our relationships with our neighbors because these are the countries we have our future with.Â€Âù        125,1E+14,0,Article,News,Afghan Effort to Get Justice for Women Seems to Stall,World,766,5.986,5.347,KABUL Afghanistan Â€Â” Despite years of intensive effort by Afghan and international rights advocates progress in obtaining justice for abused women in Afghanistan appeared to have stalled according to a report released Sunday by the United Nations.          At the same time there are intensifying fears that the continuing withdrawal of international money and staff members ahead of the 2014 Western troop pullout deadline will leave women particularly vulnerable after a decade of international attention made little headway in curbing some deeply entrenched and abusive Afghan traditions.         Â€ÂœWith the drawdown in international assistance and support there is a real risk that any advances in womenÂ€Â™s rights will erode and thereÂ€Â™s already disturbing signs of thatÂ€Âù said Georgette Gagnon the head of the United NationÂ€Â™s human rights division here who led the team that put together the report.         As an example Ms. Gagnon said the lack of an ability to bring abusers to justice was likely to increase Â€Âœthe risk of more child marriages more forced marriages and violence against women with impunity.Â€Âù         The backsliding has already begun in fact. Over the past year there have been repeated efforts in Parliament to reduce womenÂ€Â™s rights.         One new restriction in particular is likely to hurt: Parliament prohibited the use of relativesÂ€Â™ testimony in criminal cases greatly limiting the ability to prosecute domestic violence cases as they often hinge on family members as witnesses.         There was also an effort to codify the Elimination of Violence Against Women law which was approved as a decree by President Hamid Karzai in 2009 but has not been passed by Parliament.         The law criminalizes domestic violence and other harmful practices including beatings child marriages forced marriages the practice of giving away a woman or girl to settle a dispute and forced self-immolation.         But the effort to pass the law through Parliament last summer nearly unraveled it altogether as conservatives seized the opportunity to declare many of its provisions Â€Âœun-IslamicÂ€Âù including the prohibition on child marriages forced marriages and unrestricted rights to education and womenÂ€Â™s shelters. The Parliament speaker stopped the debate and sent it back to committee.         Parliament was successful however in reducing the quota of seats for female members of Parliament to 20 percent down from 25 percent and eliminated any quota at the district level. The quotas for women used to pertain to all levels of government.         Hasina Safi the executive director of the  Analysts took one bit of solace from the study: The increase in the number of complaints appeared to signal at least some rising awareness among women of their rights and a greater willingness to come forward and seek justice.         However tempering that was the reality that many more complaints were received by the Ministry of WomenÂ€Â™s Affairs and the  In the narrower context of the law and the prosecution of abuse the United Nations report found that in the past year most cases were settled by mediation which human rights advocates said meant women were often sent back into the family circumstances in which they were abused.         Based on examination of cases in 16 provinces (the United Nations said AfghanistanÂ€Â™s other 18 provinces did not provide enough information) few prosecutors were even using the Elimination of Violence law as a basis for indictments. The law was reported to have been used in only 17 percent of cases 109 out of 650 registered episodes in those provinces this year.         Worse despite the rise in reports under the Elimination of Violence law the overall number of criminal indictments filed by prosecutors under all the applicable criminal laws actually decreased this year. Some prosecutors prefer to use other criminal laws than the Elimination of Violence law in cases of abuse.        31,1E+14,0,Article,Brief,Thunder Trounce Pacers,Sports,141,5.149,6.068,Kevin Durant had 36 points and 10 rebounds as the Oklahoma City Thunder turned a matchup of two of the N.B.A.Â€Â™s best teams into a blowout with a 118-94 win over the visiting  Â–Â  LeBron James had 24 points 9 assists and 7 rebounds as the Miami Heat breezed to a 110-95 victory over the Detroit Pistons avenging a home loss to the Pistons less than a week ago.

Ms. Modiano had her breasts removed at 47 to prevent the disease and said that the day she found out her older daughter tested negative was one of the happiest of her life.         Now she wants her younger daughter Hadas 24 to be tested so she can start a family early if she is positive and then have a double mastectomy too. Ms. ModianoÂ€Â™s elder daughter Suzi Gattegno 29 disagrees.         Â€ÂœYouÂ€Â™re keeping her from living her lifeÂ€Âù Ms. Gattegno told her mother. Â€ÂœYou want to marry her off early.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœIf sheÂ€Â™s a carrier she should marry earlyÂ€Âù her mother countered.         Â€ÂœShe doesnÂ€Â™t even have a boyfriendÂ€Âù the daughter said. Â€ÂœYou need to stop pressuring her.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœI want to protect her!Â€Âù Ms. Modiano replied.         Such family debates are playing out across Israel these days. The country has one of the highest rates of breast cancer in the world  The so-called Jewish breast cancer genes have preoccupied women here for years but after the actress  Jews of Ashkenazi or central and eastern European backgrounds who  A number of influential geneticists and cancer doctors from various medical centers here say that the Israeli Health Ministry should pay for free voluntary genetic testing of all Ashkenazi women over the age of 25. About a million women would be covered at a cost of less than $100 per test. Jews of Iraqi descent whose families also often carry a harmful mutation might also be screened.         The goal of a proposed universal screening program would be to identify an estimated 30000 Israeli women who have the mutations. So far with sporadic testing about 6000 of them have been found many only after a cancer diagnosis said Dr. Ephrat Levy-Lahad the coordinator of Â€ÂœThatÂ€Â™s our target populationÂ€Âù said Dr. Oded Olsha a breast surgeon at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem. Â€ÂœIf we can find them we can save their lives.Â€Âù         Women who tested positive for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes which suppress tumors would be strongly encouraged to complete child bearing by their late 30s so they could have their ovaries removed by age 40. Risk-reducing mastectomies would also be offered.         The profoundly controversial idea of broad-based screening has already set off  The choice is not a simple one. Removing the breasts and ovaries sharply reduces the risk of cancer but mastectomies are disfiguring and women often experience scarring and numbness after breast reconstruction. Loss of the ovaries plunges women into menopause potentially leading to hot flashes a reduced sex drive and heightened risks of heart disease and bone loss.         But already demand for genetic testing is very high here Â€Â” there are yearlong waiting lists Â€Â” and national health insurance generally covers it as long as a woman is referred by her doctor or a genetic counselor.         While poor countries struggle to provide even basic cancer care to women wealthier societies like Israel and the United States are increasingly using sophisticated technologies to identify those at greatest risk in an effort to thwart the disease before it gets started. Several  The cancer divide here in Israel is more ethnic than economic. Will only Ashkenazi Jews be routinely tested? Though they are much more likely to carry one of the common harmful mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes Israel is a melting pot of both Arab citizens and Jews from all over the world and only half of the countryÂ€Â™s six million Jews are of Ashkenazi ancestry.         Under the proposal being put forward by some Israeli geneticists it is likely that Israeli Arab citizens and Jews of Sephardic ancestry Â€Â” whose families originate in North Africa and the Middle East Â€Â” would not routinely be included among those screened for BRCA mutations a point of contention in a country where a social and ethnic rift already divides Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews.         Families of Iraqi origin like Ms. ModianoÂ€Â™s may be covered because of their higher genetic risks. She always knew there was cancer in her fatherÂ€Â™s family. Three of his sisters died of breast cancer at young ages.         But she was tested for cancer-causing mutations only three years ago after finding out her relatives were being screened. The result stunned her.         Â€ÂœI thought about what it meant for me and then I thought Â€Â˜What about my daughters?Â€Â™Ã‚Â Â€Âù Ms. Modiano said recently shuddering slightly. Â€ÂœI was petrified. I still am.Â€Âù         Within three months Ms. Modiano had a risk-reducing double mastectomy and an operation to remove her ovaries. But the decisions facing her daughters both in their 20s were far more complicated. Neither was married and each had a 50 percent chance of carrying the mutation.         Ms. Gattegno who was in nursing school at the time decided to be tested.         Â€ÂœI told my boyfriend that if I turned out to be a carrier I would quit school for a while and weÂ€Â™d have kids right awayÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœAnd then IÂ€Â™d have a prophylactic mastectomy.Â€Âù         At the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem Dr. Levy-Lahad who started one of the first genetic testing programs in Israel is among the main champions of universal screening for Ashkenazi women. She has worked closely with the American scientist who identified the BRCA1 gene Mary-Claire King.         Â€ÂœIf youÂ€Â™re only testing women after theyÂ€Â™ve been affected youÂ€Â™ve lost the gameÂ€Âù Dr. Levy-Lahad said. Â€ÂœGenetic testing is about prevention.Â€Âù         She pointed to the risks. One in 40 Ashkenazi women carry a harmful genetic mutation compared to less than one in 100 women generally.         Women with these mutations are four to five times more likely to develop aggressive breast cancers according to the National Cancer Institute. The disease often comes at an early age and in both breasts said Dr. Gad Rennert the director of IsraelÂ€Â™s National Cancer Control Center.         The potential for preventing ovarian cancer a rarer but more lethal disease is even greater. The common harmful mutations found in Ashkenazis are implicated in  Practical and ethical questions abound. Should men Â€Â” who are just as likely to pass the mutations to their children and who are themselves  Identifying people as carriers can change their perceptions of themselves and the way they envision their futures said Dr. Gail P. Jarvik the head of the division of medical genetics at University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle.         Even though the testing would be voluntary women could feel pressured to participate said Barbara A. Koenig a professor of medical anthropology and bioethics at the University of California San Francisco. Â€ÂœWhen you institute mass screening youÂ€Â™re making a collective decision that this is a good thing.Â€Âù         There are also lingering scientific questions. While much is known about the three common Ashkenazi BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations the risk they confer varies. Some families may have other genetic factors that modify their risk which explains why some carriers never develop cancer while others die in their 20s.         Women identified as mutation carriers are showered with resources for early detection and prevention. These womenÂ€Â™s risk for developing breast cancer ranges from 45 to 65 percent or higher depending on family history and their risk for ovarian cancer can be as high as 39 percent.         Routine mammography screening for most Israeli women starts at 50 but carriers are eligible for frequent clinical breast exams and expensive magnetic resonance imaging of the breast all covered by national health insurance. They are also eligible for regular blood tests and vaginal ultrasounds to screen for ovarian cancer.         Many Israeli women who have the harmful mutations complain that male doctors display sexist attitudes about the importance of breasts and are loath to do mastectomies on healthy women.         Dr. Moshe Inbar an outspoken oncologist in Tel Aviv who opposes preventive mastectomies has said that a woman cannot have an orgasm after her breasts are removed an assertion not supported by evidence.         Â€ÂœWould you like to live without your breasts?Â€Âù Dr. Inbar the director of the oncology division at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center asked. Â€ÂœI try to dissuade women from doing this. Surgery is not something that should be done on patient demand; it should be done when indicated.Â€Âù         While more than a third of American women carrying the harmful genetic mutations choose preventive mastectomies only 4 percent of Israeli women do according to a  By contrast well over half the carriers in all countries but Poland had their ovaries removed a procedure that also reduces breast cancer risk.         But there are signs that attitudes are beginning to change here as women take to the Internet to research their options challenge the medical profession and shop for doctors.         Tamar Horesh 35 a computer programmer from central Israel has vivid memories of her motherÂ€Â™s painful death from ovarian cancer at 51.         When Ms. Horesh tested positive for a BRCA1 mutation she said her husband supported her decision to surgically remove her ovaries and breasts. They had three young children to raise.         Finding a doctor to do it was another matter.         Â€ÂœThe first doctor I went to said I was insane and he said Â€Â˜If you have brain cancer are you going to chop off your head?Â€Â™Ã‚Â Â€Âù said Ms. Horesh. Â€ÂœThe second doctor said that he noticed I had a small chest and he thought I just wanted an excuse to have my breasts enlarged.Â€Âù         A third doctor told her what many women hear Â€ÂœCome back when you have cancerÂ€Âù and Â€ÂœNobody dies of breast cancer nowadays.Â€Âù         In fact some 900 Israeli women die of breast cancer each year according to the  Ms. Horesh eventually got referrals from  Ms. CohenÂ€Â™s mother died of cancer at 49 and then her sister who had four young children died at 36. Â€ÂœI felt like I was going to be next in lineÂ€Âù said Ms. Cohen a divorced mother of three who was determined to stay alive for her children.         Hadas Modiano a university student in Jerusalem is waiting a couple of years before she seriously considers being tested as her mother insists. But her motherÂ€Â™s example has given her strength.         Â€ÂœI think IÂ€Â™m not as scared as I might have been because I saw what my mother went throughÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœIt was hard but she has managed and overcome.Â€Âù         But for many women the choices are harrowing. A Tel Aviv lawyer 43 who asked that her name not be used to protect her privacy was devastated when she found out at 26 that she had one of the bad mutations.         The lawyer who was only 4 when her mother died of breast cancer said she was among the first to line up for the genetic test when it became available in Israel in the 1990s.         Â€ÂœYou may think youÂ€Â™re prepared for this information but you arenÂ€Â™tÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœMy blood went cold when I found out.Â€Âù Afterward she said she realized Â€ÂœThe only solutions are so radical Â€Â” amputating parts of your body.Â€Âù         When she first met the man who became her husband she told him that she could never marry or have children. He convinced her otherwise. She goes for frequent scans and checkups but postponed having a mastectomy so she could breast-feed their children.         She chose to become pregnant through in vitro fertilization so female embryos that did not carry harmful mutations could be selected in the lab.         Â€ÂœFinally there was something positive to do with the informationÂ€Âù she said.         Preventive surgeries are not always successful. Tali Shalev had what was supposed to be a preventive double mastectomy but pathologists found a cancerous lesion in the removed breast tissue. Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m an example of someone who did everything possibleÂ€Âù said Ms. Shalev 40 who has three children.         The dilemmas of genetic testing are compounded in the ultra-Orthodox community where the emphasis on modesty often dampens open discussion.         Still Tziporah 38 a Canadian-born Orthodox mother of seven who now lives in Israel talks openly about her experience because she wants to reach other religious women. Tziporah who goes by her nickname Tzippy asked that her last name not be used to protect the privacy of her extended family members who also may carry the gene. Her mother died of breast cancer at 42 when she was 5 and when Tzippy was pregnant with her last child a few years ago she tested positive for a BRCA1 mutation.         She sought advice from several rabbis about whether she should go forward with risk-reducing surgeries. They reassured her that preserving life is one of the supreme values of Judaism.         So three years ago after her youngest child was born she had her breasts and ovaries removed. The operations were grueling but she said she wanted to make sure her children would not suffer the same loss she had. And she said she felt she had a mission to encourage other women to be tested.         Â€ÂœYou know why God did this to me?Â€Âù she said. Â€ÂœBecause IÂ€Â™ve got a really big mouth.Â€Âù         So she is spreading the word within the Orthodox community that genetic screening can save lives.         Â€ÂœWomen donÂ€Â™t have to be dying on their kidsÂ€Âù she said.        32,1E+14,1,Article,News,Protesters in Kiev Topple Lenin Statue as Rallies Grow,World,630,5.979,5.245,KIEV Ukraine Â€Â” Public protests thundered into a full-throttle civil uprising in Ukraine on Sunday as hundreds of thousands of protesters answered President Viktor F.

Â€ÂœToday they fall on their knees in front of the president of Russia and surrender us to the customs unionÂ€Âù said Oleg Tyagnibok the leader of the nationalist Svoboda Party. Â€ÂœWe demand to make public what these secret negotiations were about. They bring us back to the time of Stalinism. Is this 1937?Â€Âù         Later as the Lenin statue was pulled down and men took turns splintering it to bits with a sledgehammer protesters twice sang the national anthem removing their caps and covering their hearts with their hands. One of the hammerers wore his hair in a mohawk; another was a priest in black vestments. Onlookers shielded their faces from the flying granite chips as they cheered them on yelling: Â€ÂœGood job guys.Â€Âù         A spokesman for Prime Minister Mykola Azarov called the statueÂ€Â™s destruction Â€Âœbarbaric.Â€Âù        102,1E+14,0,Article,Op-Ed,North Korean Fallout,Opinion,8,6.571,4.965,Kim Jong-un takes steps to shorten government meetings.        27,1E+14,0,Article,Brief,U.C.L.A.

Â€Â” Fresh from handing out the largest free-agent contract in his tenure as the  There was a long table with about a dozen chairs around it two boards stationed to the side and a screen on the far wall. Here was where the MetsÂ€Â™ brass would convene for the next few days where they would discuss potential deals and debate adding a shortstop a starting pitcher or a reliever.         The Mets still have needs three or four of them Alderson indicated as he spoke with reporters for more than 20 minutes Sunday without revealing much. Before the meetings had even started it seemed he was already tempering expectations but that has been a Mets theme for several years.         Asked how much money Alderson had left to spend having split about $22.5 million of next yearÂ€Â™s payroll between Chris Young and Curtis Granderson Alderson would not give an exact number but said simply Â€ÂœWe still have some room.Â€Âù         He added Â€ÂœI donÂ€Â™t want to set up expectations one way or another.Â€Âù         He indicated that payroll could be about $85 million next season which would allow him to maybe make one other significant move. He also reiterated that Ruben Tejada his young enigmatic shortstop may start opening day.         Â€ÂœDepending how things materialize we may live with certain weaknessesÂ€Âù Alderson said. Â€ÂœFor example we could come out of these meetings with Tejada as our regular shortstop. Worse things could happen to us certainly.Â€Âù         If that becomes the case Alderson would be expected to have filled some of the MetsÂ€Â™ other needs. He said he could add a veteran starter to replace Matt Harvey next season but he also said that two young prospects Â€Â” presumably Noah Syndergaard and Rafael Montero Â€Â” could be in the rotation by midseason.         He said he could add a late-inning reliever but also said the bullpen would improve as younger players developed Â€Â” presumably someone like Vic Black.         Alderson said he could trade either Ike Davis or Lucas Duda but also said a deal may not be made this week despite continuing discussions with other teams.         If Alderson replaces Tejada it will probably happen via trade rather than free agency. Stephen Drew appears to be the only free-agent shortstop who would provide an obvious upgrade and he could command a contract worth more than $10 million per year.         Â€ÂœI donÂ€Â™t want this to be viewed as a week in which we try to replace Ruben TejadaÂ€Âù Alderson said. Â€ÂœIf we have to go into the season with Ruben Tejada as our shortstop we need to make sure weÂ€Â™re happy with that given what else weÂ€Â™ve done with the team. I think thatÂ€Â™s very possible.Â€Âù        185,1E+14,0,Article,News,Winter Meetings Start With Hall of Fame Vote,Sports,943,5.337,5.604,"LAKE BUENA VISTA Fla. Â€Â” The baseball winter meetings are starting with a look back.         Joe Torre Tony La Russa and Bobby Cox were among the candidates considered Sunday by the Hall of Fame's expansion era committee. The trio of retired managers was joined on the 12-man ballot by a pair of much-debated figures who died in recent years: New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and pioneering players' union head Marvin Miller.         Among the nine managers with three or more World Series titles Torre and La Russa are the only ones not in Cooperstown. The vote announcement is scheduled for Monday morning at the meetings site near Orlando.         ""He's going to go to the Hall of Fame"" La Russa's former closer in Oakland Dennis Eckersley predicted last year.         Torre and Cox retired as managers after the 2010 season and La Russa after leading St. Louis to the 2011 championship. Torre won four World Series titles with the Yankees La Russa three with Oakland and the Cardinals and Cox one with Atlanta. La Russa is third among managers with 2728 wins; Cox had 2504 and Torre 2326.         On the ballot for the sixth time Miller received 11 of 16 votes when the expansion-era committee last met three years ago one shy of the required 75 percent. Steinbrenner made his ballot debut in 2010 and received fewer than eight votes the Hall said without specifying.         By the time the vote is announced the lobby in the Dolphin hotel near Walt Disney World should be filled with agents and team officials arriving for the four-day session.         When the meetings were held here three years ago the ballroom where deals are announced wasn't even set up when agent Scott Boras and Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo walked in to discuss a just-completed $126 million seven-year contract for outfielder Jayson Werth.         The eve this year wasn't as dramatic. But 42 of 168 major leaguers who became free agents after the World Series already had agreements heading into the meetings with at least seven more deals in the process of being finalized.         Since Boston finished off St. Louis for its third title in 10 seasons Prince Fielder Ian Kinsler Doug Fister Jim Johnson David Freese and Heath Bell have been traded in a busy swaps market.         ""It's not the best free-agent market"" Texas general manager Jon Daniels said ""and so I think that teams realize they weren't going to be able to fill all of their needs or wouldn't necessarily want to fill all of their needs on the open market and that led to a lot more accelerated trade conversation and we're seeing that play out.""         Robinson Cano Jacoby Ellsbury Joe Nathan Jhonny Peralta Tim Hudson and Curtis Granderson are some of the top free agents who have already changed teams.         ""We're disappointed. He's been a great player a great Yankee"" New York general manager Brian Cashman said of Cano during an event Sunday in Stamford Conn. ""I know they're dotting I's and crossing T's in Seattle but they're getting a great player.""         Outfielders Shin-Soo Choo and Nelson Cruz are among the free agents still available joined by designated hitter Kendrys Morales shortstop Stephen Drew and pitchers Bronson Arroyo Bartolo Colon Matt Garza Roy Halladay Ubaldo Jimenez Fernando Rodney and Ervin Santana.         ""It's a bit like an  Cano has the largest package a yet-to-be-finalized deal said to be worth $240 million over 10 years for the All-Star second baseman.         ""Nothing should be surprising anymore. Therefore I wasn't surprised Â€Â” after a moment"" New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said. ""That kind of money has been spent before. The thing about baseball (that) is funny is that all 30 teams are on a continuum and nobody is in the same point psychologically competitively and financially at any point in time.         ""So there's always somebody who's digging in their heels they're not going to do this and they're not going to do that they're going to get the first pick every year for three years what have you"" he said. ""And there's somebody on the other end that's going crazy. It doesn't do any good to lament that. That's reality. You just have to deal with it.""         After missing the playoffs for only the second time in 19 seasons the Yankees have been big spenders despite the loss of Cano. New York has committed $307 million to add Ellsbury Brian McCann Carlos Beltran and Kelly Johnson and to retain Hiroki Kuroda and Brendan Ryan.         ""We have enough voids that we don't have to prioritize any one"" Cashman said.         It appears the Yankees have little chance of getting under the $189 million luxury tax threshold for next season. When Beltran's deal is finalized the Yankees will have 13 signed players for a tax total of $172233810. That leaves them about $5 million for the rest of their 40-man roster given that the payroll for tax purposes includes between $11 million and $12 million for benefits.         New York would gain some flexibility if Alex Rodriguez's 211-game suspension is upheld and it doesn't have to pay his $25 million salary.         ___         AP Baseball Writer Janie McCauley and AP Sports Writers Stephen Hawkins and Howie Rumberg contributed to this report.

Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s stunningÂ€Âù said the cardiologist Dr. Steven Nissen chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. Â€ÂœWe need a pause to further evaluate this approach before it is implemented on a widespread basis.Â€Âù         The controversy set off turmoil at the annual meeting of the  Dr. Sidney Smith the executive chairman of the guideline committee said the associations would examine the flaws found in the calculator and determine if changes were needed. Â€ÂœWe need to see if the concerns raised are substantiveÂ€Âù he said in a telephone interview on Sunday. Â€ÂœDo there need to be changes?Â€Âù         The problems were identified by two Harvard Medical School professors whose findings will be published Tuesday in a commentary in The Lancet a major medical journal. The professors Dr. Paul M. Ridker and Dr. Nancy Cook had pointed out the problems a year earlier when the National Institutes of HealthÂ€Â™s National Heart Lung and Blood Institute which originally was developing the guidelines sent a draft to each professor independently to review. Both reported back that the calculator was not working among the populations it was tested on by the guideline makers.         That was unfortunate because the committee thought the researchers had been given the professorsÂ€Â™ responses said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones co-chairman of the guidelines task force and chairman of the department of  Drs. Ridker and Cook saw the final guidelines and risk calculator on Tuesday at 4 p.m. when a news embargo was lifted and saw that the problems remained.         On Saturday night members of the association and the college of cardiology held a hastily called closed-door meeting with Dr. Ridker who directs the Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Brigham and WomenÂ€Â™s Hospital in Boston. He showed them his data and pointed out the problem. On Sunday officials from the organizations struggled with how to respond.         Other experts said there has not been a real appreciation of the difficulties with this and other risk calculators. Â€ÂœI donÂ€Â™t think people have a good idea of what needs to be doneÂ€Âù said Dr. Michael Blaha director of clinical research at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University who was not associated with forming the new guidelines.         Dr. Blaha said the problem might have stemmed from the fact that the calculator uses as reference points data collected more than a decade ago when more people smoked and had strokes and heart attacks earlier in life. For example the guideline makers used data from studies in the 1990s to determine how various risk factors like cholesterol levels and  But people have changed in the past few decades Dr. Blaha said. Among other things there is no longer such a big gap between womenÂ€Â™s risks and those of men at a given age. And people get heart attacks and strokes at older ages.         Â€ÂœThe cohorts were from a different eraÂ€Âù Dr. Blaha said.         This week after they saw the guidelines and the calculator Dr. Ridker and Dr. Cook evaluated it using three large studies that involved thousands of people and continued for at least a decade. They knew the subjectsÂ€Â™ characteristics at the start Â€Â” their ages whether they smoked their cholesterol levels their blood pressures. Then they asked how many had heart attacks or strokes in the next 10 years and how many would the risk calculator predict.         The answer was that the calculator overpredicted risk by 75 to 150 percent depending on the population. A man whose risk was 4 percent for example might show up as having an 8 percent risk. With a 4 percent risk he would not warrant treatment Â€Â” the guidelines that say treatment is advised for those with at least a 7.5 percent risk and that treatment can be considered for those whose risk is 5 percent.        14,1E+14,0,Article,News,A Disciplined Contrarian Who Decorates Bodies,Fashion & Style,927,5.744,5.813,LONDON Â€Â” Carla Szabo is a born-and-bred urbanite. A native of Oradea in western Romania she attended university in Bucharest and has lived ever since in the capital which at first sight can resemble a concrete maze.         Yet much of her work focuses on nature. In her current collection Â€ÂœArticulaÂ€Âù spheres of walnut linked with beads of fossilized carbon are fashioned into structures resembling the joints of insects and crustaceans.         Â€ÂœI like the world of animals. Clearly I feel familiar with itÂ€Âù Ms. Szabo a designer and entrepreneur said recently by telephone from Bucharest. Â€ÂœEver since my childhood IÂ€Â™ve been interested by the earth and all of its creatures.Â€Âù         When she was invited to accessorize a friendÂ€Â™s fashion collection a decade ago she came up with small buttons shaped like insects butterflies and snails. Shown at one of the cityÂ€Â™s earliest craft fairs those were the first objects that helped steer her career in interior design toward conceptual jewelry.         Ms. Szabo calls her works Â€Âœobjects of body decorationÂ€Âù rather than jewelry a term that to her is already loaded with meaning. Her objects are not limited to jewelry in its usual sense: they can decorate the body a table or even a wall. Â€ÂœI conceived them for the pleasure of illustrating a concept. ThatÂ€Â™s itÂ€Âù she said.         Her work is subtle and puts the wearer before the jewelry. One pendant design in the Â€ÂœArticulaÂ€Âù collection hides or reveals its diamond at the ownerÂ€Â™s choice.         But Bucharest has little time or space for such niceties. After enduring decades of shortages under Nicolae CeausescuÂ€Â™s isolationist regime Romanians embraced consumerism almost instantly after 1989. The collapse of Communism brought liberty democracy capitalism Â€Â” and the mass-produced goods that people had been longing for.         Shiny malls have mushroomed with the same offerings that can be found in shop windows across Europe. Fashion brands are dominant squeezing independent home-grown design into an intermittent quasi-underground existence showing up at occasional fairs and tiny showrooms dispersed about the city.         Still Ms. Szabo says the independent design market has gained some ground during the past decade. She has enjoyed growing promotion for her work and some support including from the state. Two of her collections were shown at  While many young artists have left for more promising opportunities abroad Ms. Szabo has stayed put and says she has no plans to leave.         Â€ÂœIn my mind there is no alternativeÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœI find it a nice thing to build in the desert.Â€Âù         A natural contrarian Ms. Szabo finds subjects for her pieces in unlikely places.         A shelter for abused horses on the outskirts of Bucharest for example inspired her 2012 collection Â€ÂœI AM.Â€Âù         The collection juxtaposed heavy and spectacular necklaces with delicate bracelets and rings. Horses in gold or silver-plated brass jumped an invisible obstacle on earrings and pendants. One of the centerpieces showed a horseÂ€Â™s profile carved in colored resin on gold-plated brass mounted on a braid of horsehair ending in two long tassels that reached down to the waist.         Fine almost translucent pieces in the collection spoke to the sense of interior beauty and the discovery of self she said Â€Â” another theme that is central to her work.         A part of the support structure that helps to keep Romanian design alive is Â€Âœ The fair recently celebrated its 10th edition in five years. But Dan Piersinaru its creator and organizer was barely elated.         Â€ÂœThere is no design market in Romania in the real sense of the termÂ€Âù he wrote in an email. Â€ÂœWhat is happening now is the beginning with all its challenges and beautiful energy.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœConsumer culture rises and falls depending on what is on offerÂ€Âù he added. Â€ÂœIf you provide quality and ethical things the culture goes in that direction. If you provide something weak and fake people get used to it quickly and easily.Â€Âù         Mr. Piersinaru who has known Ms. Szabo and her work for years says he is still surprised by her constant search for new techniques and solutions.         Â€ÂœShe has been one of the first designers here to have perhaps instinctively a strategy and an imageÂ€Âù he said.         The daughter of an architect Ms. Szabo grew up among technical drawings and has a disciplined approach to design. Her workshop in an old townhouse that she shares with a fellow designer has a flawless display of tools and materials.         Â€ÂœTalent without discipline is like a good cheese in dog skinÂ€Âù she said using a graphic popular expression.         Producing two collections a year that display a relentless drive for innovation Ms. Szabo is one of a handful of pioneering independent designers in Romania. It is a sometimes lonely business without a broad market base and she has had to be enterprising to survive.         To finance her small workshop and showroom she creates mass promotional objects for companies and uses the profit from that parallel business to finance her jewelry collections.         Â€ÂœIf you ask me what IÂ€Â™ve wanted to do until now in my life IÂ€Â™d say to express myself as a person as a feelingÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœI simply wanted to make beautiful things this is all IÂ€Â™ve wanted. And IÂ€Â™ve done it.Â€Âù         Today she is working on a new concept that should require less financing. Unlike her past collections the next one will be The pieces will be customizable around Â€Âœan invisible or barely visible object that underlines your personalityÂ€Âù she said.        191,1E+14,0,Article,News,Mobiles to Drive Faster Global Advertising Growth: Publicis Unit,Technology,279,6.197,5.75,"LONDON Â€Â” Growth in global advertising spending will accelerate to 5.8 percent a year by 2015 driven by demand for marketing via mobile devices and a broad-based economic recovery a market research group forecast on Monday.         ZenithOptimedia said spending on advertising was expected to rise by 3.6 percent this year an upward revision from its September forecast of 3.5 percent.         Advertising spending will then increase by 5.3 percent in 2014 and by 5.8 percent in 2015 and 2016 said Zenith the forecasting unit of Publicis Groupe the world's third-biggest advertising company by sales.         Zenith compiled its Advertising Expenditure Forecasts by aggregating data from leading media owners and advertising agencies in 80 countries.         ""Mobile technology is creating new opportunities for marketers to connect with consumers"" said Steve King Chief Executive of Zenith.         ""Combined with the continued rise of young dynamic markets this will spur healthy and sustained growth in global adspend over the next three years.""         Zenith predicts mobile technology will contribute 36 percent of the extra ad spend between 2013 and 2016.         Next year's Winter Olympics soccer World Cup and U.S. mid-term elections will also boost ad spending it said.         A separate report published by GroupM part of WPP the world's largest advertising company revised its worldwide advertising spending growth forecast for 2014 downward to 4.6 percent giving a total of $531 billion from growth of 5.1 percent predicted earlier this year.         It blamed economic gridlock in the United States and persistent financial crisis in the eurozone for the revision.         GroupM predicted that 2013 worldwide advertising spending will hit $508 billion a 3.3 percent increase over 2012 spending.

The exhibition Â€ÂœMade in LondonÂ€Âù runs through April 27 and features pieces by Jordan Askill Imogen Belfield Rachel Boston Duffy Husam el Odeh Noemi Klein and Frances Wadsworth-Jones.         Directed by the museumÂ€Â™s senior fashion curator Beatrice Behlen it is co-curated by Agata Belcen fashion editor at AnOther magazine.         Contemporary art goes way out beyond the evocation of aesthetic pleasure and London as a city does the same. Among the jewelry pieces on show are blinding knuckle-dusters and bits of reworked scrap that do not necessarily dazzle but do reflect the darker sometimes intimidating side of the city.         Â€ÂœAgata and I had very similar ideas on the kind of pieces we wanted for the exhibitionÂ€Âù Ms. Behlen said. Â€ÂœWe were not looking for pretty jewelry but jewelry that represented London. So a bit dark a bit edgy Â€Â” I donÂ€Â™t really like that word but I canÂ€Â™t think of another that shows exactly what I mean.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœLondon can be a hard place; you have to be quite toughÂ€Âù she continued. Â€ÂœThe pieces can be quite spiky and menacing.Â€Âù         All the jewelers work in east London an area that has become a pool of creativity over the past decade.         Â€ÂœWe wanted to focus on people who were in the earlier part of their careerÂ€Âù Ms. Behlen said. Â€ÂœOnce we had decided on a few individuals it become easier to pick the rest as connecting ideas and themes began to emerge.Â€Âù         Across the London skyline modern structures like The Shard are mixed with architectural relics like St. Pauls Cathedral.         The German born jeweler Husam el Odeh has steered away from traditional designs with his Three-way Gold Ring and his Cutlery Crown made of entwined forks and spoons which stand a few feet away from the amulets of Duffy a jeweler who makes talismanic pieces of metal and stones.         Brash graffiti covering once-abandoned warehouses in the Hackney Wick district are not so much signs of vandalism as they are subversive adornments channeling a new creative life that has invaded the buildings in art shows music nights galleries and studios. In a similar vein a Â€Âœbird droppingsÂ€Âù brooch by the London-born Frances Wadsworth-Jones subverts ideas of defilement. Â€ÂœOften my pieces are about double takesÂ€Âù she said.         Â€ÂœSomething looks normal at first but then you come closer and itÂ€Â™s able to have a double life because it is so smallÂ€Âù Ms. Wadsworth-Jones said. Â€ÂœI want to make objects that people think about because IÂ€Â™ve surprised them.Â€Âù         Each jeweler tends to work alone and according to Ms. Behlen none of them saw the work of the others until the exhibition brought them together.         Â€ÂœWhen the jewelers showed their pieces to each other it was interesting to see how many of the themes in the jewelry overlappedÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m really amazed in some ways how well everything fitted together.Â€Âù         Perhaps surprisingly one of those recurring themes was nature not something immediately associated with urban spaces.         Â€ÂœNature isnÂ€Â™t the initial thing you think of when you hear Â€Â˜LondonÂ€Â™Â€Âù Ms. Behlen said. Â€ÂœBut I think the work in this exhibition also represents new life being brought into the city which is shown through nature.Â€Âù         The work of Noemi Klein draws inspiration from the imagery of life death nature and structure. Â€ÂœI wasnÂ€Â™t aware of what anyone else was doingÂ€Âù Ms. Klein said. Â€ÂœI have thought that in recent jewelry work in general there has been a bit of overlap. I wanted to go back to what inspires the pieces as opposed to the pieces themselves. I wanted to go back to their original form.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœFor example there is this ring in one of my pieces that is like a birds footÂ€Âù she added. Â€ÂœSo I obtained a taxidermy bird to show the original foot next to the one I created.Â€Âù         Underwater creatures inspire other pieces by Ms. Klein: crustacean legs for example or a fishÂ€Â™s spine.         Â€ÂœNature has both chaos and orderÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœFor the exhibition I was free from the practical constraints of making wearable objects and it was like making mini sculptures. It was then nice to give objects an actual home.         Â€ÂœMy approach involves a lot of coincidence collecting bits of art and imagery. It is both a haphazard and technical process Â€Â” there is a lot of casting and carving a bit like a collage.Â€Âù         Like nature the process of making jewelry is constantly evolving and requires the metamorphosis of materials shapes and structures. The exhibition itself is as much about the journey of creation as it is about the final jewelry products.         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s quite different from other exhibitions and looks like more of a work space than a museumÂ€Âù Ms. Behlen said.         Husam el Odeh has recreated part of his London studio as a setting for his pieces to show the creative process and physical craft of his work. Â€ÂœI find it hard to imagine working anywhere elseÂ€Âù Mr. Odeh said. Â€ÂœI try out that thought every now and then to see if IÂ€Â™m ready Â€Â” but I donÂ€Â™t think I am.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœI started as a jeweler in London and a lot of the chaos and juxtaposition Â€Â” and how London is Â€Â” has flowed into my workÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s very substantially rooted in London. I refer to it a lot directly and indirectly.Â€Âù         Duffy is another who focuses on the productive process. Â€ÂœI became a jeweler to be a jeweler not a jewelry designerÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœTo be the jeweler is to be the person that physically makes something.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœThe different areas in jewelry are so skill-specific it would be impossible for me to be able to do everything considering people can spend five years training to be a polisherÂ€Âù he added. Â€ÂœStone settingÂ€Â™s a five-year apprenticeship too. It goes on Â€Â” enamelers engravers mounters chasers. But I try to do as much as I can.Â€Âù        11,1E+14,0,Article,News,"Laurence Graff, â€˜King of Diamonds,â€™ Reveals Some Secrets",Fashion & Style,1002,5.737,5.899,LONDON Â€Â” Laurence Graff the self-styled King of Diamonds was decorated with the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth this year 60 years after he took up jewelry in London as a 15-year-old apprentice.         Â€ÂœEvery day is a surprise every day is a joyÂ€Âù Mr. Graff said in a recent conversation. Â€ÂœI have seen so many amazing gems.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœI had Elizabeth Taylor as a great friend in my houseÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœWith Madame Marcos I used to sit on her bed and show her lovely things; IÂ€Â™ve been with the Brunei royal family right from the beginning; and I have given birth to a perfect stone from a bit of rough.Â€Âù         The jeweler caught at the Frieze art fair in London Â€Â” collecting modern art is his second passion Â€Â” is full of stories about the derring-do of his global business. He has built Graff into an international empire. He now has some 40 stores spanning the continents most recently opening in Seoul Osaka and Dubai.         But one tale this diamond buccaneer rarely reveals is the theater of creativity that plays behind the curtains of his workshop buried in the subterranean entrails of a building in the elegant Mayfair district of London.         Only a chosen few may enter through a door protected by a discreet security system this magical but very private jewelry underworld.         This is probably the largest fine jewelry workshop in Europe according to its manager Mr. GraffÂ€Â™s brother Raymond.         Here on an autumn day one of GraffÂ€Â™s 70 craft jewelers Â€Â” almost all men Â€Â” showed off some of the exquisite pieces slowly taking form in the workshop.         Â€ÂœWeÂ€Â™re very choosy who we take on because they have to have a passion for the brand and a willingness to continually learnÂ€Âù Raymond Graff said.         First came a diamond bracelet designed to fit snugly around the wrist a carved emerald in the center playing off the luminous white gems. Carefully flipped up the green centerpiece displays a different face Â€Â” a watch buried with infinite care and craftsmanship beneath the emerald lid.         More exceptional pieces followed: a diamond butterfly trembling beneath fluttering wings as if alive; flawless gems winking from a flower brooch.         Then came Mr. GraffÂ€Â™s pride and joy: a peacock brooch with a 20.02 carat deep blue pear-shaped diamond as its belly the tail fanning out into a painterly spray of colored and white diamonds.         Upstairs on the top floor of the Graff London headquarters with a view over the cityÂ€Â™s roofs is the design team. To them goes the glory of drawing and painting the peacock the flowers or a dragon pendant Â€Â” a special order from a Chinese client. Each design is elaborated with a stone as its glinting heart. The piece is first sketched and then in the case of colored gems painted by hand with a rainbow choice of colors Â€Â” and then digitally scanned.         Down below in the air-temperature-controlled space where the white walls and laboratory coats suggest a hospital more than a magicianÂ€Â™s den the jewels are fashioned by experienced fingers.         Yet they are not entirely done by hand. High-tech electronic equipment to scan and work out designs complements age-old techniques such as lost-wax casting. The workers carefully chosen from around the world move smoothly from handcraft that can be traced from Renaissance Italy to computerized treatments.         Â€Â˜Â€Â™It allows us to be precise in the way we interpret the designÂ€Âù Raymond Graff said of the digital interventions. Â€ÂœThe human eye picks up inaccuracy but it is difficult to make it perfect.Â€Âù         Meanwhile beside a sink that is far less glamorous that in the neighboring state-of-the-art kitchen a bucket of water is plonked beside strips of calico used for a flossing technique to polish the stones with which Victorian apprentices would have been familiar.         Â€ÂœPerfectionÂ€Âù is a key word for these jewels starting of course with the flawless quality of the stones. In spite of Laurence GraffÂ€Â™s eye for modern art (he sits on the committees of the Guggenheim Museum in New York the Tate Modern in London and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles) the jewels are utterly conventional in their translucent beauty.         There is no feeling of rough urgency nor any of that sense of nature in decay that impregnates the work of RenÃƒÂ© Lalique. A Graff flower instead is luminously impeccable.         Perhaps the secret of success in this tight-knit family of jewelers Â€Â” LaurenceÂ€Â™s son Francois is now chief executive Â€Â” comes from witty plays on these perfect jewels.         For the 60th-anniversary celebrations the team reproduced a fanciful idea from the 1970s when big hair was in fashion.         The re-creation of Â€ÂœHair & JewelÂ€Âù reworked on an up-do from that era decorated snakes of curls with exceptional gems including a 10.47-carat Fancy Vivid Blue flawless briolette diamond and another 6.5-carat in pink.         With the plethora of sparkling stones went the Graff Sweethearts a pair of earrings around 50 carats each cut and polished by Graff from a single diamond the 550-carat Letseng star which yielded 28 chemically pure and exquisite diamonds.         Laurence Graff remembers the 1970 version of the hairdo as being a highly original concept highlighting the idea that jewels were not only for stately matrons to wear: Diamonds could be worn by the new generation whose Â€ÂœyouthquakeÂ€Âù was challenging societyÂ€Â™s rules.         Youth is not limited to the buy side of Mr. GraffÂ€Â™s jewelry firmament. It is there in the workshop as well. There is a relatively large number of young craftsmen many of them apprentices in a profession that demands that they go through at least seven years of training before being let loose on a priceless stone.         Mr. Graff has come a long way since he sat at a bench in Hatton Garden LondonÂ€Â™s jewelry center being told at age 15 by his boss that he was never going to make it. Maybe in the distant future one of the apprentices in his workshop will grow up to challenge the diamond kingÂ€Â™s crown.        111,1E+14,0,Article,News,O.E.C.D. Warns West on Education Gaps,World,713,5.801,5.77,LONDON Â€Â” Like a school principal handing out a clutch of C grades Andreas Schleicher unveiled the results from the latest round of the Program for International Student Assessment tests last week.         For Britain the United States and most of Western Europe the results ranged from Â€ÂœaverageÂ€Âù to Â€Âœpoor.Â€Âù British students for example scored exactly average in mathematics and slightly above average in reading and science. French students were slightly below average in science and slightly above in reading and mathematics. The United States were below average in mathematics and science but slightly above in reading.         For Asian countries the news was much more encouraging with students from Shanghai topping the chart by a considerable margin but with students from Singapore Hong Kong Taiwan and South Korea all closely bunched at the high end.         Mr. Schleicher the head of education at the  Â€ÂœOn a level playing field the British look even worseÂ€Âù he said at a press conference here.         Western countries Mr. Schleicher warned should not to comfort themselves with the myth that Asian high performance is the result of education systems that favor memorization over creativity.         Â€ÂœThe big success in East Asia is not a success in drillingÂ€Âù he said adding that the mathematics  Michael Gove the British education secretary was quick to attribute his countryÂ€Â™s lackluster performance to the previous Labour government which left office in 2010. Noting that this was the first time that Britain had failed to finish in the top 20 countries in any category Mr. Gove said in a statement that unless the country could provide children Â€Âœwith a school system that is one of the best in the world we will not give them the opportunities they need to flourish and succeed.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœThat is why it is so important today that we have a unified national commitment to excellence in all our schools for all our pupilsÂ€Âù he added.         Tristram Hunt the Labour PartyÂ€Â™s spokesman on education however criticized Mr. Gove for allowing some schools to recruit what he said were unqualified teachers pointing out that the highest-performing countries were those which did the most to emphasize the importance of teaching as a profession.         Referring to the Program for International Student Assessment Mr. Hunt said in a statement: Â€ÂœThe PISA report is a big wake-up call. Eastern dominance centers on the importance that these high-performing education systems place on the quality and status of the teaching profession as the central lever for driving up standards.Â€Âù         Though most of the press coverage in Britain focused on its performance John Jerrim a professor at the Institute for Education said he thought that the big news in the results was neither the continuing rise of Asia nor the relatively flat results from the United States and Europe over all but a sharp drop in the scores for Swedish schools.         Â€ÂœSweden has the biggest decline of any country in the worldÂ€Âù Dr. Jerrim said in an interview. Â€ÂœTheyÂ€Â™re down 3.3 percent in mathematics 3.1 percent in science and 2.8 percent in reading and that continues a trend from 2009.Â€Âù         Yet the American and British governments Â€Âœhave followed the Swedish model by opening more and more Â€Â˜free schoolsÂ€Â™ or  His skepticism was echoed by Mr. Schleicher the O.E.C.D. official who said Â€ÂœThe data shows no relation between competition between schools and the overall performance level.Â€Âù         Asked afterward what the highest-performing systems had in common Mr. Schleicher said: Â€ÂœHigh performers pay teachers more. They are also systems with a commitment to universal achievement.Â€Âù         In Shanghai more than half the students tested finished in the top two categories in mathematics he noted and the figure in Singapore was 40 percent.         Only about 13 percent of French students made it into the top two categories in mathematics while in the United States only 8.8 percent did.        124,1E+14,0,Article,News,"For Del Bosque and Spain, Another Championship Phase Begins",Sports,982,5.269,5.603,LONDON Â€Â” Of all the men in the room when the World Cup draw was conducted SpainÂ€Â™s Vicente del Bosque was the one with something to lose.         He would be a fantastic poker player this lugubrious veteran coach. He suppressed a wry smile when it came out on Friday that his team the defending champion would kick off the 2014 tournament against the same opponent the Netherlands it beat through AndrÃƒÂ©s IniestaÂ€Â™s goal in extra time in Johannesburg four years ago.         Â€ÂœI told friends this morning that we would get HollandÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœGetting Chile as well makes it a rather complicated group.Â€Âù         Complicated. You do not hear del Bosque mention a Group of Death. His Dutch adversary Louis van Gaal called this Â€Âœthe worst of the groupsÂ€Âù slightly less dramatic than Jurgen KlinsmannÂ€Â™s lament that the United States was drawn into Â€Âœthe worst of the worst.Â€Âù         Del BosqueÂ€Â™s rhetoric has always been understated. He said nothing quotable nothing remotely recriminatory when  And now five and a half years after he took over the Spanish side after it won Euro 2008 Â€Â” and with just eight losses in 84 games as the national trainer Â€Â” del Bosque is seeking an unprecedented achievement of winning back-to-back World Cups together with back-to-back Euro championships.         Ten coaches have passed through Real Madrid since tired old del Bosque was dismissed. None has bettered his record. He turns 63 years old this Christmas but has just extended his contract with the national team through 2016.         Â€ÂœFootball is my passion my viceÂ€Âù he said in Rio de Janeiro in June. Â€ÂœI have had marvelous moments as a player in great teams and right now I am coaching a team which is in one of its best-ever phases. So I am enjoying it even if I am not showing it that obviously.Â€Âù         He was speaking then of the side that looked weary and was overrun 3-0 by Brazil in the Confederations Cup the rehearsal for 2014. The critics were saying then and are repeating now that Spain and its tiki-taka keep-ball style had run its time.         The core of the team Xavi HernÃƒÂ¡ndez Xabi Alonso Iniesta in midfield and Sergio Ramos Carles Puyol even Gerard PiquÃƒÂ© at the back have run so many miles for club and country won so many cups that 2014 in the heat the humidity and with the vast distances to cover in Brazil could prove a tournament too far.         Del Bosque however knows these players better than anyone else. He didnÂ€Â™t buy into the ageist argument of his president at Madrid and he looks now at Xavi (130 national team games and still running) Alonso (109 caps and just back refreshed after a long injury) Puyol (100 caps and something to prove about fitness).         Yes age creeps up on them. Yes there is sometimes a limit on how many times a champion can run through the wall of effort in a monthlong sapping tournament. But like life itself sports is a balance between youth and experience. If players like these think they have another World Cup in them why would a coach discard the talents and the know-how that has delivered?         When del Bosque says the team is in Â€Âœone of its best-ever phasesÂ€Âù he surely is understating the players once again. But even now even six months from the event the coach knows something else.         The records at youth international tournaments show that the production line of Spanish talents Â€Â” and the methods of nurturing those talents Â€Â” have far from run dry. Another estimable coach heading for the World Cup ItalyÂ€Â™s Cesare Prandelli said over the weekend that Â€Âœwe all will need 23 athletes in these temperatures.Â€Âù         Spain has talent still coming through the system to make that squad competitive. Del Bosque trusts the senior players as long as their form and fitness hold out. He also has emerging players such as Isco the 21-year-old Real Madrid prospect. And with Sergio Busquets Cesc FÃƒÂ bregas Iniesta and David Silva experienced beyond their years the cards he holds could still be a winning hand.         The fact that Spain has a difficult start suits Spain.         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s good for the mentalityÂ€Âù del Bosque suggested on Friday. Â€ÂœWhen you play lesser teams there is a problem with concentration.Â€Âù         The Spanish federation has tested that concentration to the limits. It has taken the world trophy to the far corners of the globe reaping profit wherever it goes and in the process adding to the workload on senior players. One of the eight defeats for example came last month in Johannesburg where Spain returning to the scene of its greatest triumph lost 1-0 to South Africa.         Del Bosque made 10 changes from the side that had won 2-1 in Equatorial Guinea three days previously. For the coach and for the players this was an exhibition game during a week when those players were expected to be at full speed for their clubs by the weekend.         Six months after the Confederations Cup loss to Brazil in the MaracanÃƒÂ£ and six months before the World Cup del Bosque has suggested that the nations might meet again in the 2014 final.         For that to happen Spain probably has to win its group to avoid running into Brazil in the first knockout round. And in the event of Spain and Brazil meeting again del Bosque is lining up a striker that he lacked a year ago. Diego Costa born in Brazil but scoring in La Liga for AtlÃƒÂ©tico Madrid qualified for Spanish citizenship recently and opted to represent Spain rather than Brazil at national level.         If del Bosque has lacked one piece for his jigsaw it has been a decisive finisher like Costa.        12,1E+14,0,Article,News,Reviving Retro Hair Jewels,Fashion & Style,820,5.539,5.861,LONDON Â€Â” Once the domain of EuropeÂ€Â™s tiara-ed aristocrats and Jazz Age flappers with feathers and pixie haircuts hair jewelry has made a comeback in the past year or so often with retro styling that pays more than a few passing compliments to fashion history.         Chanel recently revived the Plume de Chanel a diamond featherlike hair brooch that was first introduced in 1932 by Coco Chanel as part of her Bijoux de Diamants fine jewelry collection that year Â€Â” the only one she ever produced.         The new collection called simply 1932 pays homage to the jewelry designs of a woman who in fashion freed women from corsets and dresses. As she put them into pantsuits and casual clothing she also showed them how to still be glamorous whether in the simple elegance of her enduring little black dress or the delicate yet radical hair accent that was the Plume de Chanel.         Â€ÂœAmong the novelties seen is a diamond-fringed bandeau made to be worn either drooping over the forehead or turned back from the faceÂ€Âù The New York Times wrote on Nov. 20 1932 covering the official unveiling of Bijoux de Diamants.         Coco ChanelÂ€Â™s collection caused a stir partly because she was thought of as a couturier not a jeweler and partly because she showed the collection in her own Place VendÃƒÂ´me salon displayed on lifelike mannequin busts rather than the traditional velvet jewelerÂ€Â™s trays. As a designer she was famous for breaking old rules and opening new territories and she stuck to form when she created brooches to be worn in the hair.         At Graff Diamonds a return to hair jewelry has been a bit less ethereal. This year Laurence Graff the companyÂ€Â™s founder decided to recreate an image introduced more than 40 years ago in an audacious marketing campaign that jolted the fashion world.         In 1970 Mr. Graff teamed with the celebrity hairdresser Harold Leighton to create Â€ÂœHair & JewelÂ€Âù a wonderfully rococo ad that featured Graff diamonds twined into a young modelÂ€Â™s wildly braided hair Â€Â” a sort of glamorous Medusa bedecked in $1 million worth of jewels. It became a media sensation Â€Â” the 1970s version of going viral Â€Â” in magazines around the globe.         Â€ÂœUntil this time images showing fine jewelry were typically modeled in a more conservative styleÂ€Âù Mr. Graff said about the original concept. Â€ÂœThis image broke the mold by using a younger model and created the idea of diamonds being aspirational to younger women.Â€Âù         The 2013 version of Hair & Jewel with the model Dalia Gunther features 22 pieces of jewelry worth nearly half a billion dollars: Â€ÂœFrom the moment I started in the industry I have been in love with diamondsÂ€Âù Mr. Graff said. Â€ÂœThe depth mystery and rarity of such beautiful stones is captivating.Â€Âù         At the same time as loading up Ms. GuntherÂ€Â™s head with heavy-duty rocks Mr. Graff has also released a less extravagant hairpiece in the form of a new single-row Alice Band. Composed of a single strand of 39 delicate diamonds it is a far cry from the exuberant image of the bejeweled model.         Â€ÂœIf you wear a cocktail dress you choose your ring and earrings and necklace but you can choose something for your hair tooÂ€Âù said Anne-Eva Geffroy design director at Graff Diamonds. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s similar to a tiara but more discreet. YouÂ€Â™re basically just wearing the diamond in a different way perhaps with a simple black dress.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœOur clients are still buying the brooches and bracelets and rings this just gives them different optionsÂ€Âù she added.         Cartier became known in the Jazz Age and the 1930s not just for brooches and tiaras but as the ultimate house for hair sticks and pins which had mostly been utilitarian in design until then. One popular item which Cartier still sells is made of pink gold a pink opal onyx a pink sapphire a black sapphire black lacquer and diamonds. Price: about $15000.         Another signature Cartier item that has been re-released in recent years is a brooch of white gold and diamonds that can be worn in the hair. It made quite an impression when it was first introduced in the 1930s together with other Cartier hair ornaments.         Â€ÂœIn the hair unexpected arrangements are possible. By placing the stones in a line the effect of a long brooch comb hair-slide or diadem can be createdÂ€Âù the Paris edition of Vogue wrote at the time. Â€ÂœOther dispositions recall no other jewel and completely turn upside down our idea of ornament.         Â€ÂœHere a flash of lightning is implanted there the diamonds follow the hairline of a graceful brow.Â€Âù         That sentiment resonates some 80 years later as hair jewelry returns to evening wear with its dazzling ability to be both elegant and raffish.         Â€ÂœHair is important. It goes a long way in making us feel glamorousÂ€Âù Ms. Geffroy of Graff said. Â€ÂœAnd what better way for women to show off their hair?Â€Âù        103,1E+14,1,Article,News,Police Say Spy Found in Bag Probably Died by Accident,World,456,5.808,5.24,LONDON Â€Â” The bizarre death of a British intelligence analyst whose body was discovered inside a sports bag in a bathtub was called a probable accident by the London police on Wednesday an inconclusive ending to one of the most puzzling investigations in recent years.         Gareth Williams 31 a Welsh-born mathematician involved in code-breaking work was found dead on Aug. 23 2010 by police officers who entered his London apartment. His naked body was curled in a fetal position inside a sports bag in an otherwise empty bathtub. In a twist worthy of a spy movie the bag was padlocked but the keys to the lock were inside the bag beneath the decomposing body.         Mr. Williams had evidently led a private existence with few close friends. But with its tantalizing glimpse into the secretive world of espionage the Â€Âœspy in a bagÂ€Âù case drew intense interest from the news media which speculated that Mr. Williams might have been killed or might have died as an accidental consequence of an interest in escapology or bondage.         A post-mortem examination failed to identify a cause of death. A coronerÂ€Â™s inquest in 2012 found that  Â€ÂœFrom the inquest we set up our investigation in a different way and this has led to greater clarity on some aspects of the caseÂ€Âù Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt who oversaw the police investigation said in a statement. Â€ÂœNow at the end of our investigation based on the evidence or where we have been unable to find positive evidence we believe that it is a more probable conclusion that there was no other person present when Gareth died.Â€Âù         After three years of investigation Mr. Hewitt said Â€Âœmany questions remain unanswered.Â€Âù         He said there was no evidence that Mr. WilliamsÂ€Â™s apartment on Alderney Street in the Pimlico neighborhood Â€Â” close to the headquarters of the  Though the police did not themselves demonstrate that it was possible for a person to lock himself inside a bag Mr. Hewitt said they saw video of this being done.         Why Mr. Williams would have done so was not entirely clear. The 2012 coronerÂ€Â™s inquest heard evidence that he had visited websites dedicated to bondage and claustrophilia which involves seeking sexual thrills from being shut in enclosed spaces.         Mr. WilliamsÂ€Â™s family said in a statement on Wednesday that they stood by the coronerÂ€Â™s findings Â€Â” that he was probably the victim of an unlawful killing Â€Â” rather than those of the police.         Â€ÂœWe are naturally disappointed that it is still not possible to state with certainty how Gareth died and the fact that the circumstances of his death are still unknown adds to our griefÂ€Âù the family said. Â€ÂœWe consider that on the basis of the facts at present known the coronerÂ€Â™s verdict accurately reflects the circumstances of GarethÂ€Â™s death.Â€Âù        189,1E+14,0,Article,News,Growth to Fuel 2014 Jump in UK Company Cash Calls-Study,Business Day,382,5.591,5.869,"LONDON Â€Â” The number of UK companies that ask shareholders for more money is set to rise by almost a third in 2014 as a brighter economic outlook encourages more firms to expand their operations.         That continues a trend seen this year a study by Capita Asset Services found with the number of so-called 'cash calls' at the highest level since 2010 when most such requests were from banks looking to plug holes in their balance sheets.         A total of 10.2 billion pounds ($16.7 billion) was raised in the first three quarters of 2013 more than twice as much as in 2011 and 2012 combined. The 56 instances of firms raising capital this year is higher than in any year since 2009.         Capita AS said it expected the capital raised in 2014 to rise 29 percent.         ""On present trends around 11.6 billion pounds will be raised by the end of 2013 the highest annual total since 2009. But 2014 should see the amount of capital raised climb by almost a third to 15 billion pounds as companies act on improving demand and target growth"" the report said.         While a recent 6 billion pounds rights issue by Barclays showed some companies were still in the market for ""rescue cash"" more were asking for a positive reason Capita AS added. It cited British Land's 493 million pound share placement in the first quarter to fund growth plans.         While many firms have the necessary cash to expand others may look for fresh funds from investment managers who are expected to have money to invest after FTSE 100 heavyweight Vodafone pays out a planned dividend.         ""While many FTSE 100 firms will fund further investment and expansion from the 166 billion pound cash pile they are sitting on an improved economic outlook combined with Vodafone's record special dividend should bolster activity in 2014"" said Capita Asset Services' Justin Cooper.         Vodafone is due to return $23.9 billion in cash raised through the sale of its stake in Verizon Wireless to its U.S. joint venture partner Verizon Communications to shareholders sometime in early 2014.

But it offers an opportunity for a much bigger breakthrough: rapprochement and eventually even strategic cooperation with Iran.         International alliances morph and shift; relationships freeze and unfreeze. For the last 30 years American-Iranian relations have been stuck in a cycle of suspicion and mistrust to the detriment of both countries. Ã‚Â          America must now begin to think about a gradual realignment of its Middle East policy one that aims to reintegrate Iran into the international fold and over time transform an enemy into an ally.         It wonÂ€Â™t be easy. But in the long term it would be good for the United States Israel and the Iranian people.         There are many benefits. Iran which sits between the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf can check Chinese access to critical energy sources while acting as a buffer against an ever-truculent Russia. It also affects events in Lebanon through its ties with Hezbollah and in Israel and the Palestinian territories through its ties with Hamas. And there wonÂ€Â™t be a solution to SyriaÂ€Â™s civil war without it.         Iran currently opposes the United States in all those conflicts Â€Â” largely because of historical enmity with Washington rather than ideological hostility alone. It uses Hezbollah to further its regional interests and rails against Israel to garner popular Arab support not from a genuine commitment to the cause. And while its support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria is more sincere IranÂ€Â™s past behavior suggests it might be willing to compromise.         In 2003 fearing American military action Iran reached out via the Swiss to American officials. It offered to put everything Â€Â” including its support for Hamas and Hezbollah Â€Â”  And the United States and Iran have several overlapping interests. Bound by mutual antipathy toward the Taliban the two countries cooperated in the 2001 war in Afghanistan. Today both oppose Al Qaeda; Iran can help with intelligence and regional knowledge in that fight.         Iran would clearly benefit from warmer relations. From its 1980-88 war with Iraq to todayÂ€Â™s sanctions it has suffered. The country needs investment in its oil and financial sectors and foreign expertise to develop its economy but those are impossible without fixing its relationship with the United States.         ItÂ€Â™s easy to forget that the two nations were once allies. In the 1970s Iran and Saudi Arabia formed Richard M. NixonÂ€Â™s Â€Âœtwin pillarÂ€Âù strategy to counter Soviet influence in the region. Part of AmericaÂ€Â™s unpopularity in Iran comes from its support of the hated shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi before he was overthrown in the 1979 revolution. But a realignment today based on a new convergence of interests would be a very different proposition.         Becoming a partner of sorts with a member of Â€Âœthe axis of evilÂ€Âù would be extraordinarily hard for America. For a start the Saudis would be horrified.         But Saudi ArabiaÂ€Â™s opposition doesnÂ€Â™t really matter as much these days. The United States built its ties with the Saudis on a need for oil that no longer exists to the same degree; the relationship is artificial and anachronistic.         New fracking technologies have made America the biggest producer of hydrocarbons and non-OPEC exports in the world while Canadian South America and African sources are becoming increasingly plentiful. The Saudis still influence oil markets but they can no longer shock the global economy as they did with the 1973 oil embargo. Unlike Iran Saudi Arabia has little to offer besides oil; it doesnÂ€Â™t have a democratic tradition and its financing of Wahhabi Islam has seriously damaged American interests across the world.         Israel like Saudi Arabia fiercely objects to the nuclear deal. But thatÂ€Â™s shortsighted. DÃƒÂ©tente between Iran and America could be good for Israel in the long run. Both the Jewish state and the Persian Shiite state are outsiders in a predominantly Sunni Arab Middle East. They were allies before 1979. And though Iran supports Hezbollah and Hamas its army has never taken part in the many Arab wars against Israel.         Even after the overthrow of the shah and the subsequent hostage crisis Israel lobbied hard for the new Islamic Republic in Washington. Seeking to retain IranÂ€Â™s friendship amid a sea of hostile Arab states Israel even helped Iran in its war against Iraq.         No matter how many peace treaties are signed with Arab leaders only Iran has proved it can work with Israel. Moreover Iran cannot be contained forever; it is far better for the two countries to come to terms based on shared interests.         Iran is still a human rights violator and a sponsor of terrorism. But 30 years of sanctions and silence havenÂ€Â™t tempered its behavior. Conversely engagement strengthens IranÂ€Â™s moderates. One of Hassan RouhaniÂ€Â™s first acts as president was to release political prisoners. He has hinted that more concessions could follow if relations improve.         The Iranian people are the WestÂ€Â™s biggest asset. During the Cold War communist governments remained hostile to the West but their citizensÂ€Â™ yearning for Western freedoms contributed to the downfall of those regimes.         Iranians yearn too. The country has a strong tradition of constitutionalism stretching back more than 100 years and its citizens are sympathetic to American-style democracy and know their lives would be vastly improved through dÃƒÂ©tente with the West. ThatÂ€Â™s why they voted in large numbers for Mr. Rouhani earlier this year and for the reformer Mir Hossein Mousavi four years ago.         DÃƒÂ©tente wonÂ€Â™t happen overnight. Much of IranÂ€Â™s clerical establishment is instinctively anti-American and the American right remains hostile toward any rapprochement with Iran.         But both Mr. Obama and Mr. Rouhani have proved they can go beyond their respective hard-liners to make a deal. The 21st-century Middle East is a new and dangerous place. To lead the region into a better future Washington must adapt and leave old enmities behind.        26,1E+14,1,Article,News,A Deep-Water Diver From Brooklyn Dies After Trying for a Record,Sports,604,5.485,5.635,LONG ISLAND Bahamas Â€Â” As Nicholas Mevoli lay on his back floating in the azure sea attempting to relax his exhales were audible. The countdown had begun and he prepared to dive into DeanÂ€Â™s Blue Hole hoping to reach 72 meters on a single inhalation with no fins or supplemental oxygen. He began sipping the air attempting to pack as much oxygen in his lungs as possible.         At 12:25 p.m. Sunday surrounded by 15 other athletes and observers as well as five safety divers he turned and submerged face first and looking like a human arrow shooting into the darkness on what would be the last dive of his life.         Officials for Vertical Blue a  Â€ÂœDiving to that depth with no fins thatÂ€Â™s a hard physical diveÂ€Âù said Mike Board the British record-holder. Â€ÂœI was thinking O.K. heÂ€Â™s going to have a hard time getting up.Â€Âù         Still Mevoli shot to the surface under his own power after a dive of 3 minutes 38 seconds. ThatÂ€Â™s when the scene turned nightmarish.         Mevoli ripped off his goggles flashed the O.K. sign and attempted to complete the surface protocol that would make his attempt official by saying Â€ÂœI am O.K.Â€Âù But he wasnÂ€Â™t. His words were garbled his eyes wide and blank. He tipped backward into the ocean and lost consciousness which while alarming is not unheard-of in a sport in which almost all the top athletes have lost consciousness at one time or another though usually for only a few seconds. Mevoli was not so fortunate.         Five safety divers one of them an Australian paramedic and all certified in life support techniques hefted him onto a nearby platform where the event physician Barbara Jeschke of Germany went to work trying to revive him.         Â€ÂœThereÂ€Â™s a problem with his lungÂ€Âù shouted Marco Cosentino of Italy one of the safety divers who meet the competitors at various stages to help bring them to the surface if they are in distress. They turned Mevoli onto his side and blood began pouring from his mouth and pooling on the platform before dissipating into the sea.         At first there was a pulse at times faint at times strong. Within 15 minutes there was none. The team cut off his wetsuit and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation in earnest. Attempts to revive Mevoli which included three shots of adrenaline at the scene continued unsuccessfully for the next 90 minutes.         Mevoli 32 from Williamsburg Brooklyn was a relative newcomer to the sport. When he dived to 100 meters in May he became the first American to break that barrier unassisted. He used a monofin that day and completed the feat in 3:45. It is this type of free diving Â€Â” rather than the variety known as variable weight which uses a sled to take divers deeper than they could ever get on their own Â€Â” that has exploded in popularity in recent years. Internationally free-diving schools are multiplying in destinations as wide-ranging as Hawaii Egypt Indonesia Greece and the Bahamas.         Vertical Blue considered the Wimbledon of free diving is an annual event that attracts the sportÂ€Â™s top athletes. It is held in a unique arena: DeanÂ€Â™s Blue Hole a narrow 200-meter-deep limestone pit the deepest of its kind in the world. It is set in a cove backed by cliffs that spill into a turquoise bay. The bay laps the shore of an egg noodle of an island that is 72 miles long home to 4000 people and under the tourism radar.

He was 40.         Walker's publicist Ame Van Iden confirmed the actor's death Saturday afternoon. A statement on Walker's Facebook page said he was a passenger in a friend's car and that Walker was in the area to attend a charity event for his organization Reach Out Worldwide.         The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said that speed was a factor in the crash.         Deputies found a Porsche Carrera GT engulfed in flames when they responded to a report of a collision in the community of Valencia north of Los Angeles. Two people who were found in the car were pronounced dead at the scene.         The Santa Clarita Valley Signal reported that the Porsche crashed into a light pole and tree and burst into flames. The fundraiser to benefit victims of Typhoon Haiyan took place at a nearby racecar shop. Attendees rushed to put out the flames with fire extinguishers to no avail.         ""All of us at Universal are heartbroken"" Universal Pictures which has released the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise said in a statement. ""Paul was truly one of the most beloved and respected members of our studio family for 14 years and this loss is devastating to us to everyone involved with the 'Fast and Furious' films and to countless fans.""         Walker rode the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise to stardom starring in all but one of the six action blockbusters beginning with the first film in 2001. The blond-haired blue-eyed Los Angeles-native brought California surfer good-looks and an easy warm charm to the popular street-racing series.         The son of a fashion model and a sewer contractor Walker grew up in a working class Mormon household in Glendale Calif. The oldest of five siblings Walker's mother began taking him to auditions as a toddler. He was a child model beginning at the age of 2.         Walker has said the early induction to show business wasn't to start him on a career path but as a way to help provide for the family.         After a string of TV roles as a child in the '80s including small roles on ""Who's the Boss"" and ""Charles in Charge"" Walker made his feature film debut in the 1998 comedy ""Meet the Deedles."" Supporting roles in the films ""Pleasantville"" ''Varsity Blues"" and ""Flags of Our Fathers"" followed.         His performance in the 2000 thriller ""The Skulls"" caught the eye of producer Neal H. Moritz who cast him in ""The Fast and the Furious"" as undercover police officer Brian O'Conner. Adapted from a Vibe magazine article about underground street races the film became an unexpected hit.         In the sequel ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" Walker moved to center stage with Diesel temporarily dropping out. Walker a self-described ""gearhead"" kept his character's sports car from the film.         Walker starred in other films including the crime thriller ""Running Scared"" the Antarctic adventure ""Eight Below"" and the heist film ""Takers."" Though his stardom didn't make as much of an impact outside the ""Fast & Furious"" series Walker continually drew praise from his co-stars and directors as a kind-hearted and eager collaborator.         ""Your humble spirit was felt from the start"" Ludacris Walker's ""Fast & Furious"" co-star said on Twitter. ""Wherever you blessed your presence you always left a mark we were like brothers.""         ""Fast & Furious"" proved unusually enduring. Released in May ""Fast & Furious 6"" was the most lucrative of them all grossing more than $788 million worldwide. The seventh installment began shooting in September with a release planned for July. The film's production was on break with more shooting to be done.         Walker stars in the upcoming  He formed Reach Out Worldwide in 2010 to aid people struck by natural disasters.

"138,1E+14,0,Article,News,"Kobe Returns, but Raptors Beat Lakers 106-94",Sports,876,5.135,5.544,"LOS ANGELES Â€Â” Nearly eight months after Kobe Bryant limped off the Lakers' home court with a torn Achilles tendon and a career in doubt he struggled to keep his composure when he finally stepped back onto the same hardwood.         And though his comeback night didn't quite go to script Bryant couldn't help reflecting on the work necessary to get back on that court Â€Â” and all the months of steady labor ahead to reclaim his game.         Bryant had nine points and eight rebounds in his season debut but Amir Johnson scored a career-high 32 points in the trade-depleted Toronto Raptors' 106-94 victory over Los Angeles on Sunday night.         Bryant began his 18th NBA season by going 2 for 9 with four assists and eight turnovers in 28 minutes. The fourth-leading scorer in NBA history got hurt April 12 and persevered through several months of rehabilitation to return for Los Angeles' 20th game of the new season only to struggle with his shot his timing and his new teammates.         ""My rhythm is completely out of sync"" Bryant said. ""But this is a start and I guess a start is good.""         Nick Young scored 19 points for the Lakers who went 10-9 without Bryant this season forging a winning record without the five-time NBA champion and with little help from fellow injured MVP Steve Nash.         Adoring fans cheered Kobe's every move and forgave every misstep but Bryant couldn't rally the Lakers late despite another huge game by Los Angeles' reserves. Bryant was touched by the fans' reception and his teammates' encouragement although his ruthless competitive nature chafed against his natural emotions before the opening tip.         ""You try to control it as much as you can but you can't help thinking about the hard work"" Bryant said. ""You try to put it to the side as much as possible and do your work. ... It makes you appreciate the game this franchise and this city and all we've been through.""         The Lakers never led and Toronto improbably snapped its five-game losing streak despite playing without forward Rudy Gay who is expected to be traded to Sacramento on Monday as the centerpiece of an apparent seven-player deal.         Kyle Lowry had 23 points and eight assists and DeMar DeRozan added 10 of his 26 points in the final 4:35 of the Raptors' first road win over the Lakers in 11 tries since Dec. 28 2001.         ""(Bryant) was a little rusty and you could tell because a lot of his shots were short"" said DeRozan who grew up in Los Angeles watching Kobe. ""We were going against him his first game back but he's going to get it going again and he'll be back to the old Kobe.""         The Raptors had 11 players available after holding out Gay center Aaron Gray and forward Quincy Acy all set to head to the Kings in exchange for Greivis Vasquez Patrick Patterson John Salmons and Chuck Hayes.         That turned out to be plenty thanks to two Los Angeles natives. Johnson who attended nearby Westchester High School went 14 for 17 and surpassed his previous career high early in the third quarter. Johnson didn't take a shot in the fourth but USC product DeRozan and Lowry held off the Lakers.         ""We knew we were down because half our team got traded so our mindset was just to go out there and play hard and win this game"" Johnson said. ""It was real emotional. It happened to us last year in Atlanta too. We talked to those guys and Rudy was still at the hotel so we called him in and told him how much we all appreciated what they did for this team and the city.""         The building had the buzz of a playoff game before the opening tip with thousands of fans training cameras on Bryant during opening warmups. The building erupted in loud applause at every mention of Kobe who was introduced last in the starting lineup to the thunderous strains of ""The Imperial March"" Â€Â” Darth Vader's theme from ""Star Wars.""         The crowd roared again the first time Bryant touched the ball and he found Robert Sacre underneath the hoop for an assist on Los Angeles' first possession. With his wife Vanessa and two daughters sitting courtside Bryant hit a free throw for his first point in the second quarter followed shortly by an 8-foot double-pump left-handed bank shot for his first field goal.         Bryant added a signature 22-foot face-up jumper later in the period but also showed clear signs of rust and unfamiliarity with his new teammates.         ""We're going to have to carry Kobe a little bit because of course he's not 100 percent not in game shape"" said Xavier Henry who scored 17 points. ""It's going to be fun. It's a long year and he's just getting back.""         NOTES: The officials allowed Toronto C Jonas Valanciunas to make two free throws out of a timeout late in the first quarter but belatedly realized Lowry was supposed to take the shots. They wiped the two points off the board and put Lowry back at the line where he made both shots anyway. ... Terrence Ross banked in a shot from beyond half-court at the first-quarter buzzer to put Toronto up 30-20.

Partly cloudy best describes BryantÂ€Â™s season debut Sunday night witnessed by a rapturous sellout crowd at Staples Center that included the DodgersÂ€Â™ Yasiel Puig and an Elvis impersonator. His first shot attempt was an air ball and he committed three first-half turnovers. With Bryant on the floor the Lakers quickly fell into an 11-point deficit against the six-win Toronto Raptors.         The air stopped circulating in the building at the end of the second quarter when Bryant slipped while trying to launch a last-second shot. Â€ÂœI scared myselfÂ€Âù said Bryant who rose gingerly and left the court limping slightly on his surgically repaired left ankle.         He was back on the court for the start of the third and finished with 9 points 8 turnovers and 4 assists in a 106-94 loss.Ã‚Â          After the game Bryant repeatedly used the word Â€ÂœweirdÂ€Âù to describe his night. Â€ÂœI think the last time I took eight months off I was still in the wombÂ€Âù he said.         Asked how long it took him to feel normal on the floor Bryant said: Â€ÂœI donÂ€Â™t feel normal at all. I couldnÂ€Â™t wait to start watching film and criticize every little thing. That the challenging part.Â€ÂùÃ‚Â Ã‚Â          Coach Mike DÂ€Â™Antoni suggested that the high number of turnovers was a consequence in most instances of trying to make the extra pass. Â€ÂœHim being away eight months you knew that was going to happenÂ€Âù DÂ€Â™Antoni said. Â€ÂœThereÂ€Â™s no way he can come out after eight months off and be in midseason form.Â€Âù         He added:Ã‚Â Â€ÂœHe is human I think. YouÂ€Â™ve got to understand itÂ€Â™s going to take a while.Â€Âù         That Bryant was not all the way back was made abundantly clear in the gameÂ€Â™s seventh minute when he had a path to the basket and one defender he chose not to try to soar over. Instead he pulled up and passed out to Steve Blake who got the ball inside to Wesley Johnson for the dunk that cut the LakersÂ€Â™ deficit to 9.         There are superstars like Ronaldo and Madonna whose fame makes their surnames superfluous and then there is Bryant whose celebrity in star-studded Southern California is such that on 710 A.M. the LakersÂ€Â™ official station the local hosts refer to Bryant simply by the pronoun HIM as in HIM is back!         Nine years have passed since Burgundy first entertained movie fans. For Laker fans it only seems that long since BryantÂ€Â™s last game. He was sidelined April 12 late in a victory against the Golden State Warriors. BryantÂ€Â™s injury was so serious he took to Facebook that night posting a 300-word missive in which he described his frustration as Â€ÂœunbearableÂ€Âù and wondered if his Hall of Fame career was done.         Â€ÂœNow IÂ€Â™m supposed to come back from this and be the same player or better at 35?Â€Âù Bryant wrote then. Â€ÂœHow in the world am I supposed to do that?Â€Âù         With his famous iron will and work ethic is how. As  Or ahem HIM. While Bryant was sidelined the team jelled around SpainÂ€Â™s mild-mannered giant Pau Gasol the journeyman Nick Young and the judicious shooter Jodie Meeks. Using a fast-paced equal opportunity offense with nine players averaging at least 8 points the Lakers cobbled together a 10-9 record entering Sunday.         The teamÂ€Â™s success moving forward with Bryant the fourth-highest scorer in league history hinges on how well the newcomers are able to adjust to him and vice versa. DÂ€Â™Antoni said it would be a work in progress integrating Bryant into the mix.         Â€ÂœThe other guys canÂ€Â™t sit around and watch him playÂ€Âù DÂ€Â™Antoni said before the game. Â€ÂœTheyÂ€Â™re going to have to keep their egos intact. TheyÂ€Â™re going to have to be aggressive. TheyÂ€Â™re going to have to carry the load for a while.Â€Âù         He likened BryantÂ€Â™s return to a boulder that is dropped in a lake. Â€ÂœThereÂ€Â™s going to be some serious ripplesÂ€Âù DÂ€Â™Antoni said.         Bryant displaced Meeks the teamÂ€Â™s third-leading scorer from the starting lineup. Â€ÂœI figured it was comingÂ€Âù said Meeks who suggested BryantÂ€Â™s alpha-dog role might also have to change at least early on in his comeback.         Â€ÂœHeÂ€Â™s a great player but at the same time he hasnÂ€Â™t played in a whileÂ€Âù Meeks said. Â€ÂœWe need him but he also needs us to help him get through his rustiness.Â€Âù         Bryant had three assists before he collected his first point on the second foul shot he attempted. He logged 28 minutes. Including the night he was injured he had played at least 40 minutes in seven consecutive games as he placed the Lakers on his back last season and tried to carry them to the playoffs. DÂ€Â™Antoni said Bryant could expect to log roughly half that many minutes until he gets his playing legs back.         Bryant started at shooting guard but shifted to the point as the situation dictated a concession to the fact that the Lakers are down to one healthy point guard Blake while Steve Nash recovers from nerve damage in his back and Jordan Farmar nurses a strained hamstring.         Â€ÂœHeÂ€Â™s not going to be above the rim for a while which is fineÂ€Âù DÂ€Â™Antoni said. Â€ÂœThereÂ€Â™s some great players who played below the rim and heÂ€Â™ll have to do that for a little bit. HeÂ€Â™ll control the game and his presence will be significant.Â€Âù         Eight months after Bryant mused on  Before the game the Staples Center Jumbotron filled with BryantÂ€Â™s face. Superimposed over his image were the words that formed the latest ad campaign of his sponsor Nike: Â€ÂœKobe Bryant doesnÂ€Â™t have anything left to prove.

The unusual public memorial took the form of a car rally with drivers filing slowly past the spot in Santa Clarita where Walker 40 and Roger Rodas 38 died on November 30.         Rodas the owner of a local auto dealership and racing services company was behind the wheel of a Porsche Carrera GT with Walker in the passenger seat when it crashed into a utility pole and burst into flames.         Walker had been in Santa Clarita about 25 miles north of Los Angeles for a charity event.         The memorial which was organized via social media was scheduled for noon but Captain Mike Parker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said that mourners began arriving as early as 6 a.m. to pay their respects.         Parker said that more than 1000 cars drove past the site of the wreck now marked by flowers and cards and estimated that a total of 5000 people took part in the event. He said some mourners had come from as far away as Texas Arizona and Nevada driving in caravans.         Walker became a symbol of street-racing and car culture in his role as law enforcement officer Brian O'Conner in the ""Fast and Furious"" series.         The actor who played supporting roles in 1998's ""Pleasantville"" and 1999's ""Varsity Blues"" was in five of the six ""Fast and Furious"" films about illegal street racing heists and organized crime.         Walker also starred in the Hurricane Katrina survival drama ""Hours"" which will be released on December 13 and the crime drama ""Brick Mansions"" which is in post-production and will be released next year.

It is not that Europe will never recover but that the era of recession and austerity has persisted for so long that new growth when it comes will be enjoyed by the next generation leaving this one out.         George Skivalos 28 had to move back in with his mother two years ago in Athens. Â€ÂœEven if we get out of the crisis maybe in four years IÂ€Â™ll be 32 and then what?Â€Âù Mr. Skivalos said. Â€ÂœI will have missed the opportunity to be in a company with upward mobility.Â€Âù         Instead many in the troubled south are carving out a simple existence for themselves in a new European reality. They must decide whether to stay home with the protection of family but a dearth of jobs. Or they can travel to EuropeÂ€Â™s north where work is possible to find but where they are likely to be treated as outsiders. There young people say they compete for low-paying temporary jobs but are sometimes excluded from the cocoon of full employment.         For the European Union addressing the issue has become a political as well as an economic challenge at a time of  Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has called youth unemployment Â€Âœ But economists said the program by itself was unlikely to put more than a bandage on a gaping wound. For members of the generation that came of age since the financial storm of 2008 promises of future aid and future growth only highlight questions about when or whether they will be able to make up for the lost years.         Â€ÂœWe hope 2014 will be a year of recoveryÂ€Âù said Stefano Scarpetta the director of employment labor and social affairs at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Â€ÂœBut we are still looking at a very large number of youth who will have endured a long period of extreme difficulty. This will have a long-lasting effect on an entire generation.Â€Âù          Soon after her 23rd birthday four years ago Melissa AbadÃƒÂ_a made a wrenching decision: She would leave her close-knit family in Spain where the grinding fallout from the 2008 financial crisis had made securing a good job impossible and move to the Netherlands where employers were still hiring.         Â€ÂœWhen I got on the plane I was cryingÂ€Âù Ms. AbadÃƒÂ_a a bright ebullient woman recalled. Â€ÂœBut I had to decide: Should I fight for something back home that makes no sense or get out of there and make a life for myself?Â€Âù         Despite five years of training in nursing in her hometown CastellÃƒÂ_n de la Plana in eastern Spain she now works in a windowless stockroom in Amsterdam organizing purses socks and other accessories at a clothing store.         Unable to find work as a nurse the job she was trained for Ms. AbadÃƒÂ_a left Spain and now works in the stockroom of a clothing company in Amsterdam. It is a sign of the plight of her generation that simply having a job and a measure of independence makes her one of the lucky ones Â€Â” never mind homesickness dashed dreams of a very different career and a gradual acceptance that her life will probably never be the one she expected to live.         Â€ÂœOf course I hate the fact that I have to do thisÂ€Âù she said speaking in somber tones. Â€ÂœLeaving your country should be a decision not an obligation.Â€Âù         Finding only unpaid nursing internships and a temporary nightclub job in Spain Ms. AbadÃƒÂ_a scoured the Internet for work in EuropeÂ€Â™s more prosperous north. She quickly found employment as an au pair in Amsterdam.         For the first time she experienced the shock of being an immigrant. Having arrived in Amsterdam as part of an influx of young Spanish Greek Italian and Portuguese men and women all searching for any employment Â€ÂœI now know what itÂ€Â™s like to be seen as someone whoÂ€Â™s coming to steal jobsÂ€Âù she said.         She soon found better-paying work at the clothing shop near the Royal Palace. The store was crowded with at least 10 other young Spaniards who had migrated for employment.         She spent two years bouncing between short-term contracts which employers have sharply increased during the crisis to cut costs and avoid the expensive labor protections granted to permanent employees.         In some countries especially those with the highest youth unemployment rates short-term contracts are nothing more than opportunities for employers to take advantage of the weak labor market.         But when used by employers as intended Â€Â” to give experience to young people who otherwise could not get a start Â€Â” they can lead to steady work. That was the case with Ms. AbadÃƒÂ_a whose employer eventually turned her temporary job into a permanent contract with benefits overseeing the storeÂ€Â™s biggest stockroom.         Ms. AbadÃƒÂ_a closing up the stockroom. ""I can pay my rent save money"" she said. On one level having even that kind of employment is a victory in todayÂ€Â™s Europe. Her salary of Â‚Â¬1200 a month (about $1600) was nearly twice what she could have expected to make in Spain.         Â€ÂœThe day I signed a permanent contract was the best day of my lifeÂ€Âù she said one recent weeknight beaming as she sipped a Coke at a bustling pub.         Â€ÂœIt is almost impossible to get one now in SpainÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœHere they trust me a Spanish girl and give me responsibilities. I can pay my rent save money and be independent. IÂ€Â™m even writing a book.Â€Âù         But because of her work hours she still does not qualify for the NetherlandsÂ€Â™ monthly minimum wage of Â‚Â¬1477 (about $2000) and her new career was a long way from where she had always hoped to end up.         Discussing the path that had brought her to this point Ms. AbadÃƒÂ_a became suddenly pensive. Adjusting to a life far from home in a job beneath her skills has been harder than she imagined.         Â€ÂœI gave up the thought of working as a nurse long agoÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœWith this job IÂ€Â™m so tired sometimes that I canÂ€Â™t move. I donÂ€Â™t know what a weekend is anymore.Â€Âù         Above all Ms. AbadÃƒÂ_a still yearns for Spain. One evening in an apartment near train tracks that she shared with two roommates she gazed at photographs of her parents her brother and her best friends with whom she stays in touch via Skype. Colorful banners trumpeting Â€ÂœEspaÃƒÂ±aÂ€Âù and Â€ÂœCastellÃƒÂ_nÂ€Âù were festooned above her door. Back home her family had left her room untouched since the day she left.         Â€ÂœI miss them so muchÂ€Âù Ms. AbadÃƒÂ_a said. While she had gotten used to Amsterdam Â€Â” its drizzly skies and the directness of the Dutch Â€Â” Â€Âœevery morning I wake up and ask myself why the hell am I still here?""         Last Christmas she slipped into a mild depression alone in her apartment knowing that her family was gathered around the dinner table back home. In her worst moments Ms. AbadÃƒÂ_a said she thinks about getting a one-way ticket home.         Â€ÂœBut when you think properly about it you realize you may see your family but you are not going to find a jobÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœAfter two months maybe you will go back to working in a club in the evenings and after three youÂ€Â™ll realize Â€Â˜I canÂ€Â™t handle it anymore; I need to leave again.'Â€Â_Â€Â_Â€Âù         Ms. AbadÃƒÂ_a center with her roommates. She spends much of her time on the phone keeping in touch with her friends and family in Spain. As she sat in her apartment she discussed her situation with two colleagues from the store both from Spain. All three were angry at what they saw as chronic mismanagement of the Spanish economy by their nationÂ€Â™s leaders. With Spain adhering to austerity policies prescribed by its international creditors and Germany they said conditions had deteriorated so badly that they saw no light at the end of the tunnel.         Â€ÂœRecently I heard criticism that people like us are running awayÂ€Âù Ms. AbadÃƒÂ_a said. Â€ÂœWe didnÂ€Â™t run away. We left because the economic situation and the politicians pushed us.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœIf they donÂ€Â™t fix things they are going to lose a couple generations of smart young peopleÂ€Âù Ms. AbadÃƒÂ_a added as her friends nodded in agreement. Â€ÂœAnd then what will happen to the country thatÂ€Â™s left behind?Â€Âù         That question is weighing on European leaders. An estimated 100000 university graduates have left Spain and hundreds of thousands more from EuropeÂ€Â™s crisis-hit countries have gone to Germany Britain and the Nordic states for jobs in engineering science and medicine. Many others have gone farther afield to Australia Canada and the United States.         The current migration Â€Âœis mostly the skilled part of the populationÂ€Âù said Massimiliano Mascherini a research manager at Eurofound a European Union research agency. Â€ÂœIt is alarming for the countries that young people are leaving and it should be a big source of concern for their governments.Â€Âù         As part of the employment-promotion program discussed Tuesday European Union leaders promised to guarantee job offers and internships to jobless young people and to bolster growth in innovation and research. They also pledged initiatives to help young people find work outside their countries with cross-border vocational training.         But those pledges may be hard to carry out economists say. Â€ÂœThey have raised expectations but they need to deliverÂ€Âù Mr. Scarpetta of the O.E.C.D. said. Â€ÂœIt is a challenge for Europe in terms of credibility.Â€Âù          In Madrid Ms. MÃƒÂ©ndez said she had little faith in promises from government leaders. She moved here six years ago and graduated in the summer with her masterÂ€Â™s in sociology. Â€ÂœI wasnÂ€Â™t expecting a great lifestyle but I hoped to get a good job where I could help societyÂ€Âù Ms. MÃƒÂ©ndez a quiet determined woman said one morning in the apartment where a friend was letting her stay.         But when she graduated Spain was deep into its economic slump and the government had cut funding for the type of social services that she had hoped would make her degree useful.         Like thousands of young people hit by the crisis Ms. MÃƒÂ©ndez soon found herself underemployed grappling with a revolving door of temporary contracts that came with few benefits lower pay than permanent jobs and the risk of being laid off with little recourse.         For many young people in Europe especially those living in the most embattled economies it has become a way of life: a series of so-called junk contracts for low- or no-pay work that often verges on exploitation with long gaps of joblessness in between.         Ms. MÃƒÂ©ndez center at a meeting in Madrid of young people who feel exploited by the job market. Â€ÂœSometimes it feels as if life is not really worth itÂ€Âù she said. Young people caught in that cycle are at the edge of a growing category that economists call NEETs: those who are not in employment education or training. According to Eurofound as many as 14 million young Europeans are out of work and disengaged costing European Union member states an estimated Â‚Â¬153 billion (about $206 billion) a year in welfare benefits and lost production.         Ms. MÃƒÂ©ndez faced that kind of unsettling risk as she sought to secure any paying job. She went to a sandwich chain but wound up working a two-week tryout with no salary. A luxury Spanish hotel chain expected her to do unpaid training for two months and then work another two-month trial period without pay or a guarantee of a permanent job.         Occasionally it was overwhelming. Â€ÂœSometimesÂ€Âù she whispered Â€Âœit feels as if life is not really worth it.Â€Âù         Her inability to forge a career worried Ms. MÃƒÂ©ndez who could not even begin to think of making a home or a family. To gain experience she was making plans to form a cooperative to study social issues like gender equality and sell reports to public institutions. She also volunteered to help abused women and attended meetings of the grass-roots movement Youth Without a Future to assist other young people exploited in temporary jobs.         When she went to her job interview with the supermarket chain at the company headquarters on the outskirts of Madrid she was ushered into a room with 30 other applicants most of them with high-level university degrees. After an hour of being interviewed with the group she exited and sighed.         Not getting the job would mean Â€Âœlosing my independence and the whole life that IÂ€Â™ve tried to build for myself over six yearsÂ€Âù she said.         A few weeks later she received word: She would be hired to stock grocery shelves and run a cash register but only on a three-month contract with variable hours and no guarantee of renewal.         The monthly salary of Â‚Â¬800 (about $1080) would allow her to buy basics and avoid returning to live with her parents but not cover much else.         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s not like my situation has improved greatlyÂ€Âù Ms. MÃƒÂ©ndez said. Â€ÂœI still hope to work as a sociologist. I know that as the days go by this work will start to get me down.Â€Âù         It remains hard for her to envision a brighter future.         Â€ÂœBut I have to be strongÂ€Âù Ms. MÃƒÂ©ndez said. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s the only thing I can do.Â€Âù         In Amsterdam Ms. AbadÃƒÂ_a has been surviving her economic exile by telling herself the same thing.         She rolled up her sleeve and revealed a single word in blue cursive that she had tattooed on her forearm last year: Â€ÂœvalienteÂ€Âù the Spanish term for brave.         Â€ÂœI did this to remember that I must keep dancing until the endÂ€Âù Ms. AbadÃƒÂ_a said. Â€ÂœI was forced to leave my country and everyone I love just so I can have a life. But I need to keep dancing and trying and getting stronger. If I do that someday I can conquer the world.Â€Âù        "39,1E+14,1,Article,News,Philippine Typhoon Death Toll Feared in Thousands,World,738,5.622,5.302,MANILA Â€Â” The powerful typhoon that swept across the Philippines on Friday one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall cut a path of destruction through several central islands leaving the seaside city of Tacloban in ruins and leading to early unconfirmed estimates of as many as 10000 dead.         Wire reports quoted the city administrator of Tacloban suggesting that the death toll could reach 10000 in his city alone. A police official gave an identical estimate citing the governor of the area who had spoken with officials in villages that had been hit according to wire reports.         The government disaster agency said it could confirm only about 150 deaths so far from Typhoon Haiyan although the president said he expected the number to rise significantly. The Red Cross in Manila said earlier on Saturday that its people on the ground were reporting an estimated 1000 deaths on Leyte Island where Tacloban is and about 200 on the neighboring island of Samar.         Â€ÂœThe local Red Cross chapter has seen many bodiesÂ€Âù Gwendolyn Pang the secretary general of the Philippine Red Cross said in a text message. Â€ÂœAn actual body count has to be done to determine the exact number.Â€Âù         The destruction which has taken down phone service in many areas made confirming any of the accounts difficult.         Some meteorologists said the storm called Yolanda in the Philippines hit land with sustained winds above 190 miles per hour while others reported winds of 150 miles per hour. On Friday some in the country thought the Philippines might have been spared high casualties because the storm had moved so quickly but they did not know that it had caused a serious storm surge at least in Tacloban.         Photos and television footage showed fierce winds ripping tin roofs off homes and sending waves crashing into wooden buildings that splintered under the force. Large ships were tossed on shore and vehicles were shown piled up on top of one another. Video footage from Tacloban showed ocean water rushing through the streets of the city which has an estimated population of 220000.         Speaking to Reuters the manager of the cityÂ€Â™s airport which is on a strip of land that juts into the sea estimated that water there rose up to 13 feet. Reuters also quoted a spokesman for the national disaster agency saying many houses in Tacloban were destroyed.         A bicycle taxi driver who lives near the airport told The Associated Press that he and his family had taken refuge in a parked jeep which was swept away in the roiling waters. The man Sandy Torotoro said that as the vehicle floated by many people screamed for help as they were swept away waving their hands above the water.         Â€ÂœBut what can we do?Â€Âù he said. Â€ÂœWe also needed to be helped.Â€Âù         The Social Welfare and Development Department said that the storm affected 4.28 million people in about 270 towns and cities spread across 36 provinces in the central Philippines.         President Benigno S. Aquino III said at a news briefing on Saturday evening in Manila that he expected there to be Â€Âœsubstantially moreÂ€Âù deaths than the government had confirmed. He arrived Sunday in Tacloban according to a member of Parliament.         The government has been flying in military cargo planes carrying food clothing and shelters but blocked roads have made distribution difficult.         A United Nations disaster assessment team visited the area on Saturday.         Â€ÂœThe last time I saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunamiÂ€Âù Sebastian Rhodes Stampa the head of the team said in a statement referring to the 2004 tsunami that devastated parts of Indonesia and other countries. Â€ÂœThis is destruction on a massive scale. There are cars thrown like tumbleweed.Â€Âù         Richard Gordon the chairman of the Philippine Red Cross said in an interview that most of the information about damage and casualties was coming out of Tacloban where the news media and government officials were concentrated and that he feared there would be Â€Âœa lot of dead bodiesÂ€Âù inland as well. He said there were also areas out of contact in northern Cebu and on the island of Panay as well as parts of Palawan and Mindoro.         Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel directed the United States militaryÂ€Â™s Pacific Command to provide airborne and maritime search and rescue teams and other help a Department of Defense statementÃ‚Â on SaturdayÃ‚Â said.         According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council the deadliest storm in Philippine history was Tropical Storm Thelma which killed more than 5000 people.        57,1E+14,0,Article,Editorial,Mr. de Blasioâ€™s Fiscal Challenge,Opinion,624,5.51,5.5,Mayor Michael Bloomberg last month presented his successor Bill de Blasio with a housewarming gift: a  That depends on what you mean by pain and when you decide to endure it. Mr. de Blasio looks to be inheriting a city in good shape not in free fall from some economic crisis or natural or man-made disaster. But the budget challenges he faces are real and immense for the short and long term both for the new initiatives he has promised and the lurking obligations he will have to confront.         There is a reason Mr. BloombergÂ€Â™s notional budget was greeted cautiously if not skeptically by the de Blasio camp and dismissively by the cityÂ€Â™s municipal unions. The unions have been working on expired contracts for years and are demanding about $8 billion in retroactive pay which the Bloomberg budget does not account for. His plan assumes rather that the unions will accept the five-year deal Mr. Bloomberg has offered them before Â€Â” no raises for three years then two years of 1.25 percent raises. There has been intense hostility between the Bloomberg administration and unions representing 300000 city workers and it will be Mr. de BlasioÂ€Â™s mighty challenge Â€Â” as the populist pro-union candidate Â€Â” to negotiate and somehow pay for a way out of the impasse.         Mr. de Blasio has not yet named a budget director but his aides are poring over the budget. They say there are other fiscal concerns like the prospect of deep federal spending cuts forcing the city to spend hundreds of millions more to support the ailing Health and Hospitals Corporation and New York City Housing Authority. There is also uncertainty about federal aid for the recovery from Hurricane Sandy.         Then there is Mr. de BlasioÂ€Â™s ambitious plan to provide universal prekindergarten and after-school programs for middle schoolers at a cost of at least $500 million a year to be paid for by a new tax on rich New Yorkers. He is making this proposal at a time when Gov. Andrew Cuomo is pushing state tax policy in the opposite direction.         A commission Mr. Cuomo appointed with former Gov. George Pataki as co-chairman is considering huge cuts in property taxes. Mr. de Blasio will need the State LegislatureÂ€Â™s approval for his tax increases a hard sell even for a persuasive messenger. If Mr. de Blasio has to find $500 million by other means it will be tougher.         There are of course many ways of reducing spending and raising revenue few of them politically easy. The nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission and the cityÂ€Â™s Independent Budget Office are full of ideas like cutting overtime and lengthening the workweek to 40 hours for many city employees. One of the most consequential would involve reining in health costs by getting members of city unions to pay for a portion of their  Mr. BloombergÂ€Â™s pronouncement of a balanced budget may not square with the fiscal reality Mr. de Blasio faces come January.

First about those truths: Mr. Obama laid out a disturbing Â€Â” and unfortunately all too accurate Â€Â” vision of an America losing touch with its own ideals an erstwhile land of opportunity becoming a class-ridden society. Not only do we have an ever-growing gap between a wealthy minority and the rest of the nation; we also he declared have declining mobility as it becomes harder and harder for the poor and even the middle class to move up the economic ladder. And he linked rising inequality with falling mobility asserting that Horatio Alger stories are becoming rare precisely because the rich and the rest are now so far apart.         This isnÂ€Â™t entirely new terrain for Mr. Obama. What struck me about this speech however was what he had to say about the sources of rising inequality. Much of our political and pundit class remains devoted to the notion that rising inequality to the extent that itÂ€Â™s an issue at all is all about workers lacking the right skills and education. But the president now seems to accept progressive arguments that education is at best one of a number of concerns that AmericaÂ€Â™s growing class inequality largely reflects political choices like the failure to raise the minimum wage along with inflation and productivity.         And because the president was willing to assign much of the blame for rising inequality to bad policy he was also more forthcoming than in the past about ways to change the nationÂ€Â™s trajectory including a rise in the minimum wage restoring laborÂ€Â™s bargaining power and strengthening not weakening the safety net.         And there was this: Â€ÂœWhen it comes to our budget we should not be stuck in a stale debate from two years ago or three years ago. Ã‚Â A relentlessly growing deficit of opportunity is a bigger threat to our future than our rapidly shrinking fiscal deficit.Â€Âù Finally! Our political class has spent years obsessed with a fake problem Â€Â” worrying about debt and deficits that never posed any threat to the nationÂ€Â™s future Â€Â” while showing no interest in unemployment and stagnating wages. Mr. Obama IÂ€Â™m sorry to say bought into that diversion. Now however heÂ€Â™s moving on.         Still does any of this matter? The conventional pundit wisdom of the moment is that Mr. ObamaÂ€Â™s presidency has run aground even that he has become irrelevant. But this is silly. In fact itÂ€Â™s silly in at least three ways.         First much of the current conventional wisdom involves extrapolating from ObamacareÂ€Â™s shambolic start and assuming that things will be like that for the next three years. They wonÂ€Â™t. HealthCare.gov is working much better people are signing up in growing numbers and the whole mess is already receding in the rear-view mirror.         Second Mr. Obama isnÂ€Â™t running for re-election. At this point he needs to be measured not by his poll numbers but by his achievements and his health reform which represents a major strengthening of AmericaÂ€Â™s social safety net is a huge achievement. HeÂ€Â™ll be considered one of our most important presidents as long as he can defend that achievement and fend off attempts to tear down other parts of the safety net like food stamps. And by making a powerful cogent case that we need a stronger safety net to preserve opportunity in an age of soaring inequality heÂ€Â™s setting himself up for exactly such a defense.         Finally ideas matter even if they canÂ€Â™t be turned into legislation overnight. The wrong turn weÂ€Â™ve taken in economic policy Â€Â” our obsession with debt and Â€ÂœentitlementsÂ€Âù when we should have been focused on jobs and opportunity Â€Â” was of course driven in part by the power of wealthy vested interests. But it wasnÂ€Â™t just raw power. The fiscal scolds also benefited from a sort of ideological monopoly: for several years you just werenÂ€Â™t considered serious in Washington unless you worshipped at the altar of Simpson and Bowles.         Now however we have the president of the United States breaking ranks finally sounding like the progressive many of his supporters thought they were backing in 2008. This is going to change the discourse Â€Â” and eventually I believe actual policy.         So donÂ€Â™t believe the cynics. This was an important speech by a president who can still make a very big difference.        96,1E+14,1,Article,News,"For Son of a Nazi-Era Dealer, a Private Life Amid a Tainted Trove of Art",World,581,5.405,5.677,MUNICH Â€Â” As an expert in works of art that the Nazis called Â€ÂœdegenerateÂ€Âù and in the dealers who traded them during World War II Vanessa Voigt often wondered what had become of Cornelius Gurlitt the son of a prominent Nazi-era art dealer and a figure she had come to view as a Â€Âœphantom.Â€Âù         Early last year Ms. Voigt finally came face to face with the elusive man who kept popping up vaguely in her research. German customs officers had just stumbled on some 1280 paintings and drawings Â€Â” masterworks possibly worth more than $1 billion Â€Â” stashed in Mr. GurlittÂ€Â™s Munich apartment and they turned to her to help them understand what was going on.         As the customs officers confiscated the works a distressed Mr. Gurlitt paced restlessly around his previously inviolable domain muttering over and over to himself Â€ÂœNow they are taking everything from meÂ€Âù recalled Ms. Voigt who was present. Â€ÂœHe was mortifiedÂ€Âù she said.         In an interview his first published on Sunday Mr. Gurlitt 80  Speaking to Der Spiegel last week during a trip to an unidentified German town to see a doctor for a heart condition Mr. Gurlitt said he had not watched television since 1963 and had never gone online but did talk to his pictures. He kept his favorites a collection of works on paper in a small suitcase that he would unpack each evening to admire.         Until the raid in February 2012 Mr. Gurlitt had guarded his privacy zealously refusing to open his door even to meter readers from the gas company. He rarely spoke to or even acknowledged his neighbors. He had no friends whom anyone ever saw.         His  Indeed for more than a half-century Mr. GurlittÂ€Â™s only true companions were a vast menagerie of vibrant multicolored images created by Picasso Chagall Gauguin and a host of other modern masters. He inherited the works from his father Hildebrand Gurlitt an exuberant Nazi-era art dealer partly Jewish who at times worked in the service of the Third Reich but also counted artists disliked by the Nazis among his friends.         The collection was so valuable and perhaps its provenance so tainted by the familyÂ€Â™s association with the Nazis that the desire to keep it secure compelled Mr. Gurlitt to live a strange Gollum-like existence behind permanently drawn blinds obscuring not only the works but also the man himself.         Those works rare and irreplaceable became his entire world. He played among them as a child he told Der Spiegel and now grieves their loss. Â€ÂœThere is nothing I have loved more in my life than my picturesÂ€Âù he said.         He added with tears in his eyes that Â€Âœthey have to come back to meÂ€Âù because his family had Â€ÂœsavedÂ€Âù not looted the works. The German authorities are still trying to determine the rightful ownership of the collection and whether Mr. Gurlitt broke any laws.         When asked if he had ever been in love with a fellow human he giggled and said Â€ÂœOh no.Â€Âù         Mr. Gurlitt told Der Spiegel that he knew a lot about the origins of the works but wanted to keep that information to himself like a private love affair. Â€ÂœPeople only see banknotes between these papers with paint unfortunatelyÂ€Âù he said.         Christine Echter for 29 years the caretaker of the building where Mr. Gurlitt lives said Â€ÂœHe wasnÂ€Â™t just weird these last few years; heÂ€Â™s always been that way.Â€Âù She never saw anyone enter Mr. GurlittÂ€Â™s sixth-floor apartment she said except for his sister who lived near Stuttgart and stopped visiting about six years ago.        12,WZLhHcXC62qvj1hhTIdYmA,1,Blogs,Blog Post,"In Hookups, Inequality Still Reigns ",Health,3967,6.5,5.984,"N a t a s h a   G a d i n s k y ,   2 3 ,   s a y s   s h e   d o e s n â€™ t   h a v e   a n y   r e g r e t s   f r o m   h e r   y e a r s   i n   c o l l e g e .

The B.J.P.Â€Â™s victories seemed largely driven by the sour anti-incumbency mood high food prices and anger over corruption. In Delhi the biggest sensation was an unexpectedly strong showing by the year-old party Aam Aadmi or Common Man whose jubilant supporters gathered outside its headquarters on Sunday morning waving brooms to symbolize the cleansing of IndiaÂ€Â™s political class.         The results from the four states Â€Â” Delhi Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh Â€Â” do not offer a perfect template for the coming general elections since they are all states where the B.J.P. has traditionally been strong. But they make it clear that the Congress PartyÂ€Â™s welfare programs and customary promises can no longer compel a younger urbanized electorate and that the party has failed to project an image of leadership at a time when voters crave it.         Â€ÂœIt is a substantial defeat for CongressÂ€Âù the historian Ramachandra Guha said as results were announced on Sunday morning. Â€ÂœCongress itself may learn nothing; they firewall their senior leadership from criticism even internally. But what we are learning is that the charisma of the Gandhi family is basically more or less goneÂ€Âù he said referring to the family that has dominated Indian political life for decades.         The results he added represented the voice of Â€Âœa much younger group of voters who do not remember the contributions or sacrifices real or imagined of  Preliminary counts posted by the Election Commission on Monday morning showed the B.J.P. Â€Â” a pro-business Hindu nationalist party Â€Â” wresting the state of Rajasthan from CongressÂ€Â™s hands in a landslide winning 162 out of the stateÂ€Â™s 200 assembly seats to just 21 for Congress. The Congress Party also performed dismally in Delhi winning only eight of the stateÂ€Â™s 70 assembly seats. The B.J.P. won the largest number 31 but not enough to form a government without joining a coalition. Aam Aadmi the unorthodox new entry defied expectations by securing 28 seats in Delhi.         Congress lost a tight contest in Chhattisgarh winning 39 seats to the B.J.P.Â€Â™s 49. And the B.J.P. easily retained control in Madhya Pradesh winning 165 of the assemblyÂ€Â™s 230 seats and leaving Congress with 58.         This fallÂ€Â™s campaign had a sharp tone largely because of the B.J.P.Â€Â™s aggressive new leader Narendra Modi. At vast rallies Mr. Modi a commanding speaker has cast the contest as a presidential-style face-off between two men Â€Â” himself and Rahul Gandhi the diffident scion of the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty. Mr. Modi the son of a tea-stall operator presents himself as a self-made man sneering at Mr. Gandhi as a cosseted Â€ÂœshehjadaÂ€Âù or prince and frequently alluding to the health problems of his mother Sonia Gandhi who remains a respected party leader.         Mr. Gandhi has at times seemed to struggle to retain the attention of his audiences. Ms. Gandhi and her son made a few grave statements as the depth of SundayÂ€Â™s losses sank in. An unsmiling Ms. Gandhi said the defeat Â€Âœcalls for deep introspectionÂ€Âù including into Â€Âœthe way we took or did not take our message to the people.Â€Âù         Rahul Gandhi said he had plans for a deep transformation of the party and seemed to dip into the language of Aam Aadmi. Â€ÂœWhat we need to do as a party is to move ahead of just talking about good governance and move to a paradigm to a place where we are actually giving serious space to the common manÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœI am going to put all my efforts into transforming the organization of the Congress Party.Â€Âù         An ebullient scene unfolded outside the headquarters of Aam Aadmi which was ridiculed when it announced its formation with barely a year to go before the Delhi election. A crowd gathered beating drums and throwing colored powder into the air.        164,1E+14,0,Article,News,"Brees Sharp, Saints Beat Panthers 31-13",Sports,791,4.982,5.729,"NEW ORLEANS Â€Â” Drew Brees saw his face on giant Superdome video boards then nodded and smiled as a jubilant crowd applauded the star quarterback's latest milestone and the meaningful way in which he hit it.         Brees passed for 313 yards and four touchdowns and New Orleans beat Carolina 31-13 on Sunday night to regain sole possession of first place in the NFC South and snap the Panthers' winning streak at eight games. In the process Brees became the fifth quarterback to eclipse 50000 career yards passing.         ""Love this offense. Love what Sean Payton's put together"" Brees said.         The Panthers' defense had not allowed more than two touchdowns in a game this season until the Saints (10-3) scored three in the second quarter alone when Brees completed 14 of 16 passes for 159 yards.         The Saints also became the only team this season to score more than 24 points against Carolina (9-4) which entered the game No. 1 in scoring defense allowing 13.1 points per game.         Brees' first two scoring strikes went to Marques Colston who made nine catches for 125 yards. Jimmy Graham added two TD catches his second making it 31-6 in the fourth quarter.         ""We just had great balance"" Brees said. ""Marques came up with some huge catches as did Jimmy. The line did a great job ... and the defense did a great job of getting us the ball.""         New Orleans sacked Cam Newton five times and did not allow a touchdown until 5:15 remained. Junior Galette had three of New Orleans' sacks and Cameron Jordan two.         The Panthers had the ball for 11:30 of the first quarter showing an early ability to move the ball in the face of an energized and loud Superdome crowd but only got two field goals out of it after New Orleans came up with clutch third-down stops including one on third-and-goal from the 6.         ""I'm surprised and disappointed. We're a better team than we played today"" Carolina coach Ron Rivera said. ""They have the crowd behind them and they're on turf not natural grass which is a little bit different. It helps them as far as their speed and their timing. The things that they do here they do very well. We'll see how things go when they come to Carolina.""         Last Monday night New Orleans went to Seattle looking to lead the race for the top playoff seeding in the NFC only to fall 34-7 and drop into a tie with Carolina atop their division.         But the Saints looked like legitimate contenders again in their return home where they are 7-0. They became the first team not to lose a turnover to the Panthers all season. Brees completed 30 of 42 passes in becoming the first quarterback to pass for at least 4000 yards in eight straight season and pass for 30 TDs in six straight seasons.         New Orleans now owns a one-game lead over the Panthers with three games to go but travels to Carolina in two weeks.         ""Here we are attempting to make another run at it"" Brees said. ""Obviously some records and some other things milestones along the way that you get to share but I'm just glad to be on the journey with this group of guys.         Brees' best drive began with 2:01 left in the first half and New Orleans at its own 24. He immediately found Lance Moore for 21 yards Colston for 19 yards and Darren Sproles for 20 setting up Graham's 5-yard TD catch to make it 21-6.         Newton was 22 of 34 passing for 160 yards DeAngelo Williams returned from a quad contusion that sidelined him last week gaining 52 yards on 13 carries.         ""It was a great measuring stick for who we are and where we have to go"" Newton said. ""The best thing about this is we have an opportunity to face this team again in two weeks. Those guys just were better than us today. Are they better than us? No.""         The Panthers struggled to move the ball on most drives after the first quarter when Graham Gano hit field goals of 45 and 24 yards.         Brees' other TDs went for 8 yards to Graham and for 6 and 15 yards to Colston who was hardly surprised by the QB's quick return to form.         ""You've just got to see him throughout the week"" Colston said. ""The man works like I've never seen. He deserves every bit of success that he gets.""         Notes: The other four QBs with 50000 yards are: Brett Favre with 71838 Peyton Manning with 64009 Dan Marino with 61361 and John Elway with 51475. ... Panthers RB Jonathan Stewart left the game with a knee injury the severity of which was not immediately disclosed.        "145,1E+14,0,Article,News,Saints Help NFL Set Single-Day Record for TDs,Sports,137,5.509,5.897,NEW ORLEANS Â€Â” The NFL set a single-day record for touchdowns when the New Orleans Saints scored three times in the first half of Sunday night's game against the Carolina Panthers.         Drew Brees found tight end Jimmy Graham for a 5-yard score right before halftime for his third TD pass making it 88 touchdowns on a wild day across the league. The previous record was 87 in Week 17 of the 2012 season on Dec. 30 according to STATS LLC.         A slew of high-scoring afternoon games set the stage for Brees' record breaker.         Peyton Manning threw for four touchdowns in Denver's 51-28 victory over Tennessee and Cincinnati and Indianapolis combined for 10 touchdowns in the Bengals' 42-28 victory. Philadelphia had four TDs in the fourth quarter of a 34-20 victory against Detroit.         ___         AP NFL website: 60,1E+14,0,Article,News,Three Senators Try to Hold Off G.O.P. in South,U.S.,1291,5.771,5.594,NEW ORLEANS Â€Â” Things traditionally get started a little late down here an inclination that runs from mealtimes to political races. But with nearly a year to go before the 2014 election it is already open season on Senator Mary L. Landrieu Democrat of Louisiana.         Â€ÂœWhy didnÂ€Â™t she do her job protect us from Obamacare from the start?Â€Âù asks a new ad from Americans for Prosperity a political nonprofit group founded by the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch. And a post from a conservative blog that refers to her as Â€ÂœMussoLandrieuÂ€Âù with a picture of her face superimposed on the body of Benito Mussolini has been making the rounds on Twitter.         Republicans are so giddy about the prospect of winning her seat that their main problem is too many of them are trying to do so. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s a different world than Louisiana was six years agoÂ€Âù said Bernie Pinsonat a pollster in Baton Rouge. Â€ÂœWe do not have Democrats who win anything in this state today.Â€Âù         As Democrats look across the rest of the South the outlook does not get much better. Ms. Landrieu along with Senators Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina is pretty much all that is left of Southern Democrats in the Senate.         All three are up for re-election next year. And the outcome of their races could determine whether the Southern Democrat once a formidable species in the Senate is headed for extinction.         Â€ÂœDemocrats are fighting against history in most of the SouthÂ€Âù said Thomas F. Schaller a professor of political science at the University of Maryland Baltimore County who wrote a book on Democrats and the South called Â€ÂœWhistling Past Dixie.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœYou can still elect a Democrat to a statewide office in the SouthÂ€Âù he added Â€Âœif you have the right candidate with the right biography in the right cycle. And then hopefully you get some help from the RepublicansÂ€Â™ nominating a bad candidate. But thatÂ€Â™s a lot of ifs.Â€Âù         Next year Democrats will face not only a general hostility to the national party among Southern white voters but also a keen dislike of President ObamaÂ€Â™s Affordable Care Act. Representative Bill Cassidy one of the Republicans opposing Ms. Landrieu has an attack ad that calls her Â€ÂœBarack ObamaÂ€Â™s rubber stamp.Â€Âù She and her two Southern colleagues in the Senate voted for the health plan and have reiterated their support though they have also rushed to criticize the administrationÂ€Â™s handling of the rollout and pushed for modifications. Republicans are trying to exploit the opening insisting that each of the incumbents muttered the decisive Â€ÂœayeÂ€Âù that allowed the law to pass which was approved 60 to 39.         Â€ÂœPryor is the 60th vote Hagan is the 60th vote Landrieu is the 60th voteÂ€Âù said Merle Black a professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. Â€ÂœEverybody is the 60th vote.Â€Âù         The DemocratsÂ€Â™ peril is especially striking given the regionÂ€Â™s history: Their party long dominated the old Confederacy a legacy of the Civil War Reconstruction and later resistance to civil rights and produced powerful Senate figures like Richard Russell of Georgia and James Eastland of Mississippi.         The region has swung from total Democratic to almost total Republican control over the last half-century starting with voter defections from the Democrats in the 1960s emerging Republican congressional delegations in the 1990s and a wave of state legislative takeovers in recent years.         Voting has increasingly become racially polarized. John Barrow of Georgia is the only white Democrat in the House of Representatives from one of the Deep SouthÂ€Â™s five states.         If Republicans defeat Democratic incumbents in Arkansas Louisiana and North Carolina and hold on to the seat of Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia who is retiring they will control every Senate seat in the old Confederacy except in Florida and Virginia which have drifted culturally and politically from the rest of the South.        179,1E+14,0,Article,News,"Slipping, Sliding, Frantic Finishes in Snowy NFL",Sports,875,5.595,5.471,"NEW YORK Â€Â” A wintry wonderland of games featured in National Football League action on Sunday with snow impacting several contests while the Denver Broncos reached the playoffs and the Indianapolis Colts claimed the AFC South title.         Snow buried yard-markings cut visibility and inspired the building of snowmen on the sidelines in four contests played in conditions that set up a slew of sensational scoring plays and a series of breath-taking comebacks.         In more conventional settings the Broncos (11-2) charged past the Tennessee Titans (5-8) 51-28 to clinch a playoff berth and hand the Colts the AFC South division title.         Indianapolis (8-5) claimed their crown despite losing 42-28 to the AFC North-leading Cincinnati Bengals (9-4).         The San Francisco 49ers denied their NFC West rivals the Seattle Seahawks a division-clinching victory by beating the visitors 19-17.         Frank Gore burst through Seattle's line for a 51-yard run to set up a game-winning 22-yard field goal by Phil Dawson with 26 seconds left.         It was Dawson's fourth field goal of the game and improved the 49ers to 9-4 while dropping the Seahawks to 11-2.         The teams' two young quarterbacks dueled to a standoff.         San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick completed 15 of 29 passes for 175 yards with one touchdown with one interception. Seattle signal caller Russell Wilson hit on 15 of 25 passes for 199 yards one TD with one interception.         SLIPPING SLIDING         Early games in the East were hit by snow storms that caused slipping sliding and an avalanche of big plays as offensive players in the open field cut past stumbling defenders.         The most frantic finish came in a 29-26 victory for the reigning Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens (7-6) over the visiting Minnesota Vikings (3-9-1) that allowed the winners to maintain a fragile hold on an AFC wild card berth.         Five touchdowns were scored over the last 125 seconds of the game in ping-pong fashion.         ""Oh my gosh. I don't know if there has ever been a crazier (finish) ever"" Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco told reporters.         Flacco had the last laugh throwing a nine-yard touchdown strike to Marlon Brown with four seconds left to cap a five-play 80-yard drive that took just 41 seconds.         The last-gasp drive came after Vikings quarterback Matt Cassel threw a short pass to receiver Cordarrelle Patterson who raced 79 yards for a go-ahead touchdown with 45 seconds left in the game.         That had followed a 77-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by Baltimore's Jacoby Jones which came on the heels of a 41-yard touchdown burst up the middle by running back Toby Gerhart after league rushing leader Adrian Peterson left the game with an apparent ankle injury.         ""Will we ever see another game like that again?"" said relieved Baltimore coach John Harbaugh.         Keeping pace in the AFC with the Ravens were the Miami Dolphins (7-6) who maintained their sunny disposition by holding on for a 34-28 win over the Steelers in Pittsburgh.         Miami quarterback Ryan Tannehill tossed three touchdown passes in the snow.         The Steelers (5-8) gave the Dolphins a final scare with a desperation effort on the last play of the game.         Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger who passed for 349 yards and three scores connected on a short pass and after a series of laterals fleet-footed Antonio Brown sped up the sideline and into the end zone before officials ruled he had put a toe on the sidelines 13 yards short of paydirt.         'CAN'T SEE'         The heaviest snow fell in Philadelphia where the white stuff piled up above the players' ankles in the Eagles' 34-20 victory over the Detroit Lions in a match-up of division leaders.         At one point the referee announced ""Please clear the goal line. We can't see the goal line.""         Sloppy conditions seemed to suit Philadelphia running back LeSean McCoy who darted through the Lions for a franchise-best 217 yards including touchdown runs of 57 and 40 yards.         Philadelphia (8-5) took a half-game lead over Dallas in the NFC East while the Lions dropped to 7-6 atop the tight NFC North.         In the other snowy game the visiting Kansas City Chiefs routed the Washington Redskins 45-10 to snap a three-game losing streak and improve to 10-3.         In another fantastic finish the New England Patriots overcame the visiting Cleveland Browns 27-26 with two late scores after losing tight end Rob Gronkowski to an apparent knee injury.         Quarterback Tom Brady threw two touchdown passes in 30 seconds including the winner with 31 seconds left after New England (10-3) recovered an onside kick.         In Denver Broncos kicker Matt Prater set an NFL record with a 64-yard field goal and quarterback Peyton Manning led them on a second-half charge to rally past the Titans.         The victory on a frigid day in the Mile High City came in coach John Fox's return to the sideline for a double celebration for the playoff-bound Broncos (11-2). Fox had missed the past month after undergoing heart surgery.         In Cincinnati the AFC North-leading Bengals beat the Colts 42-28 as quarterback Andy Dalton led the way with three TD passes and also ran in for another. The Bengals took their record to 9-4 while the Colts slipped to 8-5 though they later clinched the AFC South crown with Denver's win over Tennessee.

Washington defenseman Nate Schmidt added a goal in the third for the Capitals who beat Nashville at home on Saturday. Schmidt a 22-year-old rookie scored his first NHL goal in that game.         Grabovski's goal came on a penalty shot.         In his fourth NHL game Philipp Grubauer made 30 saves for Washington (16-12-2) to earn his first career win. The Capitals have won four of five.         New York (15-15-1) beaten at home in overtime by New Jersey on Saturday has lost three of five. Henrik Lundqvist made 32 saves and Benoit Pouliot scored the Rangers' lone goal with 1:53 left to spoil Grubauer's shutout bid.         The Rangers are 0-1-1 on their team-record nine-game homestand.         Washington now has a three point lead over New York for second place in the Metropolitan Division.         Chimera opened the scoring 2:28 into the second period. He found a loose puck in a cluster of players around the crease and shoved it in before being knocked down by Justin Falk.         That ended Lundqvist's shutout streak against Washington at 202 minutes 28 seconds dating to Game 6 of last season's first-round playoff series.         Just 25 seconds later Oleksy ripped a slap shot past Lundqvist to give Washington a 2-0 lead.         Grabovski was awarded a penalty shot with 1:34 left in the second after Ryan McDonagh hooked him on a breakaway. Grabovski then beat Lundqvist glove side with a slap shot from between the circles.         Schmidt pushed the lead to 4-0 with 2:57 left.         Much of the game was played on the perimeter as both teams clogged the middle of the ice in their defensive zones. Washington recorded 36 shots and New York finished with 31.         Both teams were 0-for-2 on the power play.         Despite the playoff history between the two teams the game lacked emotion outside of several scrums. Offensive stars Rick Nash of the Rangers and Washington's Alex Ovechkin were given roughing penalties during a late second-period dust-up.         NOTES: New York D Marc Staal sat out after being injured Saturday against New Jersey. Rangers coach Alain Vigneault described the ailment as ""neck issues which are causing him to have some symptoms."" Staal who has a history of concussions hadn't yet been diagnosed with another. ""We're taking every precaution"" Vigneault said. ""We'll probably know more in the next day or two."" Michael Del Zotto replaced Staal in the lineup. ... Grubauer made his second NHL start and second outing of this season. His other start came last season.        "140,1E+14,0,Article,News,Invasive Cockroach Found in NYC Can Take the Cold,U.S.,465,5.513,5.68,"NEW YORK Â€Â” The High Line a park that turned a dilapidated stretch of elevated railway on Manhattan's West Side into one of New York's newest tourist attractions may have brought a different kind of visitor: a cockroach that can withstand harsh winter cold and never seen before in the U.S.         Rutgers University insect biologists Jessica Ware and Dominic Evangelista said the species Periplaneta japonica is well documented in Asia but was never confirmed in the United States until now. The scientists whose findings were published in the Journal of Economic Entomology say it is too soon to predict the impact but that there is probably little cause for concern.         ""Because this species is very similar to cockroach species that already exist in the urban environment"" Evangelista said ""they likely will compete with each other for space and for food.""         That competition Ware said will likely keep the population low ""because more time and energy spent competing means less time and energy to devote to reproduction.""         Michael Scharf a professor of urban entomology at Purdue University said the discovery is something to monitor.         ""To be truly invasive a species has to move in and take over and out-compete a native species"" he said. ""There's no evidence of that but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be concerned about it.""         The newcomer was first spotted in New York in 2012 by an exterminator working on the High Line.         The scientists suspect the little critter was likely a stowaway in the soil of ornamental plants used to adorn the park. ""Many nurseries in the United States have some native plants and some imported plants"" Ware said. ""It's not a far stretch to picture that that is the source.""         High Line said in a statement it sources its plants through mostly northeastern U.S. nurseries which go through USDA inspections and that no issues were raised with them.         ""Our team of experts will continue to keep an eye on it"" the statement said. The statement said High Line does not believe the insect is having a negative impact on the park.         Periplaneta japonica has special powers not seen in the local roach population: It can survive outdoors in the freezing cold.         ""There has been some confirmation that it does very well in cold climates so it is very conceivable that it could live outdoors during winter in New York"" Ware said. ""I could imagine japonica being outside and walking around though I don't know how well it would do in dirty New York snow.""         The likelihood that the new species will mate with the locals to create a hybrid super-roach is slim.         ""The male and female genitalia fit together like a lock and key and that differs by species"" Evangelista says. ""So we assume that one won't fit the other.""

Â€ÂœThe world is going to be watching us and we really want to do a great job on this story.Â€Âù         A  Â€ÂœIt smells like cannabis in Julie DooleyÂ€Â™s northeast Denver commercial kitchenÂ€Âù the article opened. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s not the pungent Cheech and Chong odor though. ItÂ€Â™s slightly aromatic and not at all unpleasant.Â€Âù         Mr. Baca 36 a former music and entertainment editor grew up in the Denver area and has worked at The Post for 12 years. His new job he said will go far beyond chronicling ColoradoÂ€Â™s stoner culture. He has already been in contact with journalists abroad exploring how the stateÂ€Â™s new laws compare with those in other countries like the Netherlands where recreational drug use is illegal yet tolerated. He has also been in contact with reporters in Washington the other state that has legalized marijuana use to potentially work with.         Â€ÂœEverybody here knew we needed to amp up our coverageÂ€Âù Mr. Baca said. Â€ÂœBut nobody knew how this was going to happen.Â€Âù         As soon as he was named to the post he acknowledged using marijuana. Â€ÂœIf I werenÂ€Â™t completely honest from the get-go we lose credibilityÂ€Âù said Mr. Baca who recently became engaged to his girlfriend while vacationing in Bali.         Mr. Baca is in the process of hiring a staff and has reviewed about 70 rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ©s for the position of pot critic. He has also discussed with his colleagues whether the title on his business card should read Cannabis Editor or Marijuana Editor. (In some circles the word marijuana is considered pejorative and carries racial connotations.)         The Denver PostÂ€Â™s ambitious push into marijuana coverage comes as the paper has had some success amid dismal times for the newspaper industry. While many dailies are bleeding readers The PostÂ€Â™s Sunday circulation grew to 615315 by March 31 compared with 491400 in March 2010 according to the Alliance for Audited Media. Roughly one-quarter of its readership subscribes digitally while most newspapers count digital readers as 19 percent of their readers. It is in the process of introducing a subscription model. And it has also had success on the journalism side winning a Pulitzer Prize each of the last four years.         Management at The Post selected Mr. Baca to oversee coverage partly because of his success attracting a younger audience a demographic that appeals to advertisers. In 2001 Mr. Baca helped start a festival for the paper called the Underground Music Showcase that he modeled after South by Southwest. In 2007 he started a music site called  Â€ÂœWhile I do believe pot is an issue that will reach across generations itÂ€Â™s probably going to have a younger readershipÂ€Âù Mr. Tully said.

The paper is adding the drug to a list of substances that its employees are barred from using on the job.         Â€ÂœI will never come to work stonedÂ€Âù he said.

Â€Â” Adam Lanza spent the final months of his life mostly alone in his bedroom. His windows were covered with black trash bags. He was preoccupied with violent video games and created a spreadsheet of some of the worst massacres in American history.         Mr. Lanza refused to speak even to his mother communicating with her only by email even though their bedrooms shared the same floor of their house on Yogananda Street.         He would not eat unless his food was arranged in a particular way on his plate. He hated birthdays and holidays and forbade his mother from putting up a Christmas tree.         He also made her get rid of a cat he did not like.         No one else was allowed into his room including his mother who nevertheless did her sonÂ€Â™s laundry daily because he changed his clothes often.         Among their few outings together were trips to the shooting range. She planned to buy him a gun for Christmas last year.         Mr. Lanza 20 could not connect with people but obsessed over Â€ÂœDance Dance RevolutionÂ€Âù an interactive video game he played in the lobby of a nearby movie theater spending as long as 10 hours at a time trying to follow dance routines as they flashed on the screen.         Last year four days before her son killed 20 first graders and six adults at  Ms. Lanza returned on Dec. 13 at 10 p.m.         The next morning her son shot and killed her in her bed.         A  But what it does not answer is why.         The long-awaited report does not suggest a motive for Mr. LanzaÂ€Â™s actions even as it offers a glimpse into his strange troubled life. It comes nearly a year after the shooting set off a national discussion about gun control mental health and violence in American popular culture.         In that time families of the Sandy Hook Elementary victims have struggled to put their lives back together the town has tried to heal and the school has been razed. But until Monday little information compiled by investigators had been publicly released.         Even basic facts like the path Mr. Lanza took inside the school were kept secret.         After the shooting the Connecticut General Assembly passed bills to limit what could be made public. The state also fought to prevent the release of the recordings of the emergency calls to 911 from people inside the school. At a hearing on Monday before the reportÂ€Â™s release Judge Eliot Prescott of New Britain Superior Court said that he would review the tapes and soon decide whether to release them.         The report was based on voluminous evidence and interviews conducted by the Connecticut State Police and the stateÂ€Â™s attorneyÂ€Â™s office along with federal authorities. It marks the end of the investigation.         Investigators struggled to make sense of Â€ÂœcontradictoryÂ€Âù descriptions of Mr. Lanza by those who knew him.         The report notes that while Â€Âœsignificant mental health issuesÂ€Âù affected his ability to live a normal life and interact with others it remained unclear if they contributed in any way to his actions last December. Mr. Lanza received a diagnosis in 2005 of an autism variant known as AspergerÂ€Â™s syndrome but there is no evidence that people with AspergerÂ€Â™s are more likely than others to commit violent crimes.         Mr. Lanza was treated by mental health professionals according to the report but none of them saw anything that predicted his future behavior.         Â€ÂœTutoring desensitization and medication were recommendedÂ€Âù the report said. Â€ÂœThe shooter refused to take suggested medication and did not engage in suggested behavior therapies.Â€Âù         There were reports of troubling behavior as early as the fifth grade when Mr. Lanza produced Â€ÂœThe Big Book of GrannyÂ€Âù for a class project. The main character had a gun in her cane and shot people.         In 2006 as a seventh grader Mr. Lanza was described by a teacher as intelligent but obsessed with violent imagery.        47,1E+14,1,Article,News,"A Diverâ€™s Rise, and Swift Death, at the Limits of a Growing Sport",Sports,2489,5.524,5.613,Nicholas Mevoli saved money from an assortment of jobs to pay for the bottomless pursuit of holding his breath and sinking his body as far as possible into the ocean.         He practiced holding his breath in bathtubs and Brooklyn swimming pools even seeing how far he could run with one gulp of oxygen. For roughly the past two years free diving consumed his life turning him from novice to national record-holder.         But on Sunday in pursuit of another record in a championship event in a hidden cove of the Bahamas in front of the best free divers in the world Mr. Mevoli came to the surface Â€Â” but he was not all the way back. After diving down to 68 meters he paused and reached 72 meters before turning back. After staying under water for 3 minutes 38 seconds Mr. Mevoli 32 pulled off his goggles Â€Â” and quickly fell into unconsciousness. He died soon after.         Mr. MevoliÂ€Â™s life and death reflect both the spirit of a fast-growing niche sport and its dangers. His rise from novice to record-holder in little more than a year serves both as an inspiration and as a dire warning to an undersea world of divers whose stars rise as the depths they reach plunge.         Free diving with ancestral roots in the ocean hunters of previous millennia is practiced by tens of thousands of certified recreational divers tracked by a web of free-diving agencies including AIDA the international governing body known by its French acronym. But competitive free diving in which athletes are not permitted to use snorkels or any oxygen supply remains a niche sport. The AIDA calendar comprises about 20 events through March some with nominal prize money. High-dollar sponsorships are few. Some of the top athletes teach courses on how to free dive but few if any make a living as a competitor.         Nicholas Mevoli on Sunday upon surfacing from a record attempt. He died a short time later. Â€ÂœI really enjoy going on this journey where other people canÂ€Â™t goÂ€Âù said Michael Board a British record-holder who went to compete in the Bahamas over the weekend. Â€ÂœThe feeling of being deep under water somewhere youÂ€Â™re not meant to be and feeling this sort of mastery over your body and your mind and it being so peaceful and youÂ€Â™re not scared. ItÂ€Â™s a real achievement.Â€Âù         Kimmo Lahtinen the president of AIDA suggested that Mr. MevoliÂ€Â™s natural talent might have pushed him to the sportÂ€Â™s top tier too fast perhaps stripping him of the Â€Âœimportant experience that is needed to stay alive in an exceptional depth.Â€Âù         The organization said in a statement Monday that Mr. MevoliÂ€Â™s death was the first in more than 20 years of its competitions. It planned to review the accident Â€Âœto learn what we can do to prevent further serious injuries.Â€Âù         On Monday several dozen free divers who had swum with Mr. Mevoli gathered at DeanÂ€Â™s Blue Hole a legendary 200-meter cavity to remember Mr. Mevoli in the place where he attempted his last dive.         DeanÂ€Â™s Blue Hole is a circle of darkness in a turquoise-colored cove of Long Island a sparsely populated splinter of an island in the Bahamas. It may be a mecca for free divers the world over but locals have been warned by previous generations not to venture close; it was carved by the devil and will suck you into its depths.         Mr. Mevoli Â€ÂœwalkedÂ€Âù up a dive line while preparing for a dive at the Deja Blue III competition. Mr. Mevoli like his daring friends and competitors brushed off the danger. He loved the purity of free diving man against water man against himself no snorkel or oxygen tank. Swim into the depths of the ocean until the water turns from blue to black and the light fades to dark. Down down down every meter into the abyss meaning another meter back to the light.         Â€ÂœWater is acceptance of the unknown of demons of emotions of letting go and allowing yourself to flow freely with itÂ€Âù Mr. Mevoli wrote in a blog post in June. Â€ÂœCome to the water willing to be consumed by it but also have confidence that your ability will bring you back.Â€Âù          Mr. Mevoli lived in an apartment above a bar in Brooklyn. His door was usually open the couch available to whichever friend was passing through the city. On his Facebook page Mr. Mevoli Â€Â” Nicholas or Nick sometimes Nic Â€Â” made jokes about being a diving Â€Âœhobo.Â€Âù He posted photos of himself: striking light brown eyes lean sometimes mustachioed and often with fins in hand.         Raised mostly in Florida Mr. Mevoli was described by a trove of friends as someone who was both unique and a familiar type of single man in Brooklyn. He played drums and was a fan of Thelonious Monk. He took pride in the gnocchi he prepared along with his fish bakes. He traveled the world and was close with his grandfather a World War II veteran.         He played kickball in McCarren Park went to concerts with friends wrote screenplays and acted on stage. He had a handful of odd jobs over the years including work in a bagel shop. He was a talented BMX biker handy with tools often seen riding his bike while wearing a tool belt on his way to work as a prop manager.         He was a member of Rising Sun Performance Company where he was a performer technician and writer. But a little more than two years ago he curbed his acting roles to focus more on free diving. He spent tens of thousands of dollars on the sport.         Mr. Mevoli was drawn to the ocean from a young age said his stepfather Fred Rudzik. The two did scuba diving lessons together when Mr. Mevoli was a teenager in Florida. Â€ÂœHe always loved waterÂ€Âù Mr. Rudzik said.         Two years ago Mr. Mevoli was taking intermediate-level free-diving classes at Immersion Freediving of Fort Lauderdale Fla. In May 2012 he plunged to a depth of 91 meters in his first major competition in the Â€Âœconstant weightÂ€Âù discipline which allows for a fin on the feet to help propel the diver.         Safety divers guided Mr. Mevoli to the surface after he blacked out 30 meters under water in May 2012. Ted Harty the companyÂ€Â™s founder and a record-setting diver himself congratulated his student on Facebook for his Â€Âœamazing progressÂ€Âù in going from 30 meters to more than twice that depth in a matter of months.         Â€ÂœI canÂ€Â™t wait to see what he can doÂ€Âù Mr. Harty wrote in the post.         Mr. MevoliÂ€Â™s training in New York included swimming in still pools his stepfather said as well as running up and down flights of stairs holding his breath. His family said he was not surprised that he was breaking records so soon after he discovered the sport. Â€ÂœMaybe he pushed his body beyond where many athletes doÂ€Âù Mr. Rudzik said.         In May off the coast of Honduras Mr. Mevoli established an American record by dropping 100 meters in the constant-weight discipline. He was under water for 2 minutes 45 seconds.         Mr. Lahtinen the president of AIDA said the sportÂ€Â™s safety record was quite strong. The organization which is 21 years old has a database of 35000 dives Â€Â” and he said serious accidents in organized competitions were almost never seen.         But as the popularity of free diving surges Mr. Lahtinen said safety is going to remain a central issue.         William Trubridge left and Nicholas Mevoli relaxed at a competition in Honduras in May. Â€ÂœNick was an exceptional talent in this sportÂ€Âù Mr. Lahtinen said. Â€ÂœI think this was one of the things which may have something to do with this accident.Â€Âù         He added: Â€ÂœYou are going to the limits faster and faster. When you are dealing with this kind of depth it is something where you need a lot of experience.Â€Âù         Two months ago as Mr. Mevoli won a silver medal at the world championships in Greece he was temporarily frustrated with his performance and mental state. In a blog on www.usfreediving.org he told of wandering the city streets after a constant-weight dive to 75 meters occasionally spitting blood on the sidewalk. He wondered why he was so consumed by reaching tangible depths.         Â€ÂœNumbers infected my head like a virus and the need to achieve became an obsession. Obsessions can killÂ€Âù he wrote.         He added: Â€ÂœI ask you would you like me any less if I was only a diver who couldnÂ€Â™t make it past 20m?Â€Âù          Sea creatures are made primarily of water which is virtually incompressible. So they thrive.         But humans are full of voids Â€Â” most prominently the lungs. When humans descend to greater depths the rising pressure forces the lungs to shrink in size.         Water is almost 1000 times denser than air and the enormous pressure from its sheer weightiness mounts rapidly during descent. As you go down by weight every 10 cubic feet of seawater equals roughly one cubic foot of lead.         Francisco Ferreras-Rodriguez of Cuba who set a world record for diving without the aid of breathing gear plunged in 1996 to a depth of 436 feet. Studies later showed that the seaÂ€Â™s pressure at 400 feet compressed his chest size by more than half Â€Â” lowering it from a circumference of 50 inches at the surface down to 20 inches.         Marine mammals that routinely dive deep have lungs that can collapse entirely. Some have chests built like accordions Â€Â” designed to fold. Whales seals and other deep-diving mammals store oxygen not in their lungs but in networks of powerful muscles.         For humans the crushing deep poses unique challenges. Scuba diving mitigates the most obvious obstacle with oxygen tanks. Casual divers typically go down no farther than about 100 feet limiting the water pressures and lung contractions that they experience.         But as free divers descend they experience a rapid shrinkage of the lungs and the compression of the gases inside. That enriches the bloodstream with the two main components of the air Â€Â” oxygen and nitrogen.         One danger is nitrogen narcosis or rapture of the deep which prompts a kind of giddy stupidity that encourages risk-taking. The drunkenness is thought to arise when excess nitrogen in the bloodstream and organs prompts nerve impulses to slow. The physiological effect is thought to be similar to the action of nitrous oxide an anesthetic that produces pleasurable sensations.         Such befuddlement experts say may have prompted Mr. Mevoli to disregard symptoms of danger and suddenly renew his quest to dive deeper. He paused and seemed to turn back toward the surface at 68 meters or 223 feet but then turned around and proceeded to dive deeper.         Barbara Jeschke a doctor and the Vertical Blue organizer William Trubridge preparing adrenaline to administer to Nicholas Mevoli on the platform Medical experts say deadly problems can arise as a diver goes ever downward and pressures from the water keep rising.         Â€ÂœThereÂ€Â™s a limit to lung compression when you dive deepÂ€Âù said Dr. Paul J. Ponganis a practicing anesthesiologist and a physiologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. Â€ÂœThis sport is always pushing that limit.Â€Âù         Blood from the legs and arms gets forced into the heart and chest cavity which in humans is kept from total collapse by the bony rib cage and other chest structures. Typically the body of an adult male holds roughly five liters of blood and studies have shown that the outer pressure on divers can send up to one liter of excess blood flowing into the chest cavity.         At first that pooling of blood around the heart and lungs is a good thing supplying the diver with life-giving oxygen.         But as the pressures rise the fragile human body gets transformed into a kind of pressure cooker that is squeezed hard on all sides Â€Â” by extreme water pressure on the outside and blood pressure on the inside.         Dr. Ponganis said the added pressure in the circulatory system radiated through the lungs and could force blood vessels and capillaries in the lungs to burst and bleed Â€Â” in the worst case slowly filling the lungs with blood.         Â€ÂœEverything in the chest is getting squeezedÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœCapillaries are being distended. Blood vessels in the lungs distend and rupture. Even the pulmonary vessels become engorged.Â€Âù         Athletes in free-diving competitions often return to the surface with bloody noses. But Dr. Ponganis said that the cardiovascular dysfunctions in Mr. MevoliÂ€Â™s fatal dive appeared to have been much worse.         Dr. Ponganis said Mr. Mevoli probably suffocated his lungs unable to absorb the oxygen in the air. But he cautioned that only an autopsy would be able to detail the likely cause of death.         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s a sad caseÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœTo me itÂ€Â™s a very dangerous sport. It pushes your physiology to the limits.Â€Âù          Free divers consider DeanÂ€Â™s Blue Hole the best place in the world to free dive Â€Â” a seemingly bottomless pit (actually more than 200 meters deep) of limestone. Last weekend it was the scene of Vertical Blue the sportÂ€Â™s crowning event with 35 athletes representing 16 countries.         But at 11:10 a.m. local time Monday a crowd of 80 mourners gathered on the crescent-shaped beach. Some came with flowers and began passing them around. Three women linked arms beneath a parasol. A Shins song crooned from the public-address system used to announce dives during the competition.         Japanese free divers at a memorial service for Nicholas Mevoli at DeanÂ€Â™s Blue Hole. All other traces of the competition were gone including the platform where attempts were made to revive Mr. Mevoli the day before.         The free divers gathered were among the worldÂ€Â™s best and most experienced but they acknowledged that they knew relatively little about their sportÂ€Â™s safety protocol.         Â€ÂœBecause there is so little proper medical information on lung squeezes we only think we know the risksÂ€Âù said Mr. Board the British record-holder. Â€ÂœWe go into dives going on feeling.Â€Âù         One by one those in the free-diving fraternity stepped forward to offer their own grace notes.         Â€ÂœHe always wanted to hold his breath and diveÂ€Âù said Ren Chapman Mr. MevoliÂ€Â™s training partner. Â€ÂœThat was his life.Â€Âù         William Trubridge a world-record-holder and organizer of Vertical Blue recalled a day when he and Mr. Mevoli were snorkeling in Honduras. Mr. Trubridge saw a turtle and began to take pictures. Mr. Mevoli took the camera away and told Mr. Trubridge to enjoy the moment to swim with the turtle.         At the ceremonyÂ€Â™s end mourners swam together to the center of the blue hole and formed a circle over the shadowy depths below their feet. They took a collective breath and dived under the water.         Fellow competitors of Nicholas Mevoli at Vertical Blue gathered to pay tribute to him in DeanÂ€Â™s Blue Hole where he attempted a free-diving record Sunday. He died later that day. Â€ÂœWhen we have a new national record or world record the tradition is to splash the hell out of themÂ€Âù Grant Graves the lead judge at Vertical Blue said. Â€ÂœLetÂ€Â™s celebrate his life like we celebrated his record in Honduras. So letÂ€Â™s splash it out for him.Â€Âù         The group batted and kicked the water in celebration. Some gritted their teeth in anger; others laughed. The hole foamed and frothed.        23,1E+14,1,Article,News,Whatâ€™s He Really Like?

Kevin Durant certainly played like there was on Sunday night scoring 36 points and grabbing 10 rebounds as the Thunder made quick work of the visiting Pacers with a 118-94 win.         What started as a matchup of NBA Finals' hopefuls quickly turned into a rout with Oklahoma City leading by as many as 29 points in the first half before finishing with stars Durant and Russell Westbrook Â€Â” who added 26 points and 13 assists Â€Â” resting comfortably on the bench.         It was also a largely one-sided affair Â€Â” particularly early Â€Â” in the matchup between Durant and Indiana All-Star Paul George.         George finished with 32 points but he had only six at halftime as the Thunder surged ahead and never looked back.         ""I take everything personal no matter who I'm playing"" Durant said. ""I'm always grateful for the opportunity to play so I never want to take it for granted.         ""... Of course playing one of the best teams in the league you've always got to bring it a little bit more I guess and tonight I think we all did that.""         While George was quiet offensively in the first half Durant opened the game with a point to prove against last year's Eastern Conference finalist.         The NBA's leading scorer at 28.5 points per game hit 6 of 7 shots in the first quarter scoring 14 of the Thunder's first 18 points. It was just the start of the fun for Oklahoma City which improved to 10-0 at home this season and is the only Western Conference team still undefeated at home.         ""I think we know that we can play with the best of them"" Westbrook said. ""I think tonight we did a good job of just playing our game.""         Durant was 14 of 23 from the field and Oklahoma City shot a season-best 61 percent (47 of 77). Reggie Jackson added 15 points off the bench while Serge Ibaka finished with 13.         Indiana which shot just 40 percent (34 of 85) was playing its second game in two nights Â€Â” having won at San Antonio on Saturday.         Roy Hibbert backed up George's strong second-half performance with 12 points while David West also finished in double figures with 11.         It was all too-little too-late for the Pacers who suffered their worst loss of the season. Their only other losses were by 16 points at Chicago on Nov. 16 and by four points at Portland on Dec. 2.         ""I wouldn't say we had tired legs but the Thunder definitely knew what we were up against"" George said. ""They knew this was a back-to-back night for us. They came out with that urgency to really run us and see if we could compete and match their energy.""         The Thunder swept the regular-season series with Indiana last season and they nearly equaled their season-high of 119 points in the win Â€Â” falling one point short of what they scored on Nov. 8 against Detroit.         Oklahoma City led by as many as 14 points in the first quarter stretching that to 19 points in the second quarter after Jeremy Lamb's 3-pointer put the Thunder up 43-24.         Lamb's 3-pointer capped a 15-4 run for Oklahoma City all coming from its reserves Â€Â” led by Jackson's seven point.         The Thunder shot 54.8 percent (23 of 42) in the first half while Indiana shot just 32.6 percent (15 of 46).         ""Tonight obviously for our guys Oklahoma City was just a step quicker on both ends of the court"" Indiana coach Frank Vogel said.         NOTES: Indiana finished a five-game trip against the Thunder going 3-2 on the road with losses to Oklahoma City and Portland. ... The Pacers who played two of the top Western Conference teams in San Antonio and Oklahoma City in their last two games return home to face two-time defending NBA champion Miami on Tuesday.        "134,1E+14,0,Article,Obituary (Obit),"Art Kaminsky, Top Agent for Hockey Players, Dies at 66",Sports,720,5.681,5.87,On Feb. 22 1980 the United States hockey team triumphed over the powerful Soviet squad in the Winter Olympics in what came to be called the  For Art Kaminsky a lawyer and sports and entertainment agent who died at 66 on Thursday at his home on Long Island the victory was particularly sweet. He had cultivated the American players for months convincing them of the benefits of staying amateur a while longer to play on a medal-winning team.         After the win in Lake Placid N.Y. more than two-thirds of the 20-member team Â€Â” as well as Herb Brooks the coach Â€Â” chose Mr. Kaminsky to handle contract negotiations and other financial affairs. At the time he represented about one-third of the players in the National Hockey League.         Â€ÂœIt is unlikely that any lawyer ever tied up so large a portion of a major sports leagueÂ€Âù The New York Times reported in 1980.         At the Lake Placid Games he also represented Eric Heiden who won five individual gold medals in speedskating Â€Â” the only time that has happened Â€Â” and his sister Beth who won a bronze medal in speedskating.         He represented Ken Dryden who was trying his hand at broadcasting for ABC after a Hall of Fame career as a goalie for the Montreal Canadiens. A few years later Mr. Kaminsky added Mr. DrydenÂ€Â™s co-announcer at the Games Al Michaels who memorably exclaimed at the end of the AmericansÂ€Â™ victory over the Soviets: Â€ÂœDo you believe in miracles? Yes!Â€Âù         Though Mr. Kaminsky continued to represent hockey and baseball players and other athletes he increasingly gathered television announcers under his wing. Â€ÂœAt one point he may have represented more people in the sports television industry than anybody in the businessÂ€Âù Mr. Michaels said in an interview Friday.         He expanded beyond sports broadcasters to news announcers and commentators like Keith Olbermann Forrest Sawyer Christiane Amanpour and Robert Krulwich.         Â€ÂœHe had great rapport with every broadcast and news executive on the planetÂ€Âù the sports announcer Marv Albert said.         Arthur Charles Kaminsky was born in the Bronx on Dec. 29 1946. His wife Andrea said he died of metastasized cancer at their home in Manhasset N.Y.         Mr. KaminskyÂ€Â™s parents moved to Manhattan before he was 5 and then to Jericho on Long Island when he was 12. He entered Cornell as a confirmed basketball fan but soon fell in love with hockey.         In his senior year he piled three friends in a car and drove 20 hours to Duluth Minn. to watch Cornell play North Dakota in the N.C.A.A. tournament. He became friends with Dryden who played for Cornell.         Mr. Kaminsky graduated with a major in government in 1968 and from Yale Law School in 1971. He was an intern with the consumer advocate Ralph Nader for a summer. After working in Congress for Representative Michael J. Harrington Democrat of Massachusetts he joined the powerful Paul Weiss law firm and helped organize political campaigns for Representative Allard K. Lowenstein Democrat of New York and others.         In 1972-73 Mr. Kaminsky helped Dryden negotiate a contract with the Canadiens and his association with him eased his way in approaching others. Mr. Kaminsky began cultivating relationships with American college players who were top prospects for the N.H.L.         He also began covering collegiate hockey for The Yale Daily News hockey newsletters and The Times giving him access to locker rooms. Other agents complained pointing out that the N.C.A.A. barred agents from talking with college athletes. Mr. KaminskyÂ€Â™s access to athletes as a lawyer gave him another advantage over many other agents.         In addition to his wife the former Andrea Polin Mr. Kaminsky is survived by his daughter Alexis Bleich; his sons Thomas and Eric; his sister Janet Pawson; and two grandchildren.         Mr. Michaels remembered Mr. Kaminsky as a rumpled man who carried armfuls of manila folders into negotiations and as fierce in protecting athletes from the news media and other distractions.         When Debi Thomas did not win a gold medal in figure skating at the 1988 Calgary Olympics Mr. Kaminsky blamed an interview she had given during an afternoon practice session before the nightÂ€Â™s event.         Â€ÂœI saw DebiÂ€Â™s interview and I said to myself Â€Â˜SheÂ€Â™s going to loseÂ€Â™Ã‚Â Â€Âù he told The Times.         She finished third.        46,1E+14,1,Article,Op-Ed,The Plot Against France,Opinion,561,5.712,5.393,On Friday Standard & PoorÂ€Â™s the bond-rating agency  So whatÂ€Â™s going on here? The answer is that S.& P.Â€Â™s action needs to be seen in the context of the broader politics of fiscal austerity. And I do mean politics not economics. For the plot against France Â€Â” IÂ€Â™m being a bit tongue in cheek here but there really are a lot of people trying to bad-mouth the place Â€Â” is one clear demonstration that in Europe as in America fiscal scolds donÂ€Â™t really care about deficits. Instead theyÂ€Â™re using debt fears to advance an ideological agenda. And France which refuses to play along has become the target of incessant negative propaganda.         Let me give you an idea of what weÂ€Â™re talking about. A year ago the magazine The Economist  Given such rhetoric one comes to French data expecting to see the worst. What you find instead is a country experiencing economic difficulties Â€Â” who isnÂ€Â™t? Â€Â” but in general performing as well as or better than most of its neighbors with the admittedly big exception of Germany. Recent French growth has been sluggish but much better than that of say the Netherlands which is  Meanwhile  What about the longer-run burden of an aging population? This is a problem in France as it is in all wealthy nations. But France has a higher birthrate than most of Europe Â€Â” in part because of government programs that encourage births and ease the lives of working mothers Â€Â” so that its demographic projections are much better than those of its neighbors Germany included. Meanwhile FranceÂ€Â™s remarkable health care system which delivers high quality at low cost is going to be a big fiscal advantage looking forward.         By the numbers then itÂ€Â™s hard to see why France deserves any particular opprobrium. So again whatÂ€Â™s going on?         HereÂ€Â™s a clue: Two months ago Olli Rehn EuropeÂ€Â™s commissioner for economic and monetary affairs Â€Â” and one of the prime movers behind harsh austerity policies Â€Â” dismissed FranceÂ€Â™s seemingly exemplary fiscal policy. Why? Because it was based on tax increases rather than spending cuts Â€Â” and tax hikes he  In other words never mind what I said about fiscal discipline youÂ€Â™re supposed to be dismantling the safety net.         S.& P.Â€Â™s  You might think that Mr. Rehn and S.& P. were basing their demands on solid evidence that spending cuts are in fact better for the economy than tax increases. But they werenÂ€Â™t. In fact research at the I.M.F. suggests that when youÂ€Â™re trying to reduce deficits in a recession the opposite is true: temporary tax hikes do  Oh and when people start talking about the wonders of Â€Âœstructural reformÂ€Âù take it with a large heaping of salt. ItÂ€Â™s mainly a code phrase for deregulation Â€Â” and the evidence on the virtues of deregulation is decidedly mixed. Remember Ireland received high praise for its structural reforms in the 1990s and 2000s; in 2006 George Osborne now BritainÂ€Â™s chancellor of the Exchequer called it a Â€Âœshining example.Â€Âù How did that turn out?         If all this sounds familiar to American readers it should. U.S. fiscal scolds turn out almost invariably to be much more interested in slashing Medicare and Social Security than they are in actually cutting deficits. EuropeÂ€Â™s austerians are now revealing themselves to be pretty much the same. France has committed the unforgivable sin of being fiscally responsible without inflicting pain on the poor and unlucky. And it must be punished.        70,1E+14,1,Article,News Analysis,The Year the Monarch Didnâ€™t Appear,Sunday Review,979,5.548,5.571,ON the first of November when Mexicans celebrate a holiday called the Day of the Dead some also celebrate the millions of monarch butterflies that without fail fly to the mountainous fir forests of central Mexico on that day. They are believed to be souls of the dead returned.         This year for or the first time in memory the monarch butterflies didnÂ€Â™t come at least not on the Day of the Dead. They began to straggle in a week later than usual in record-low numbers. Last yearÂ€Â™s low of 60 million now seems great compared with the fewer than three million that have shown up so far this year. Some experts fear that the spectacular migration could be near collapse.         Â€ÂœIt does not look goodÂ€Âù said Lincoln P. Brower a monarch expert at Sweet Briar College.         It is only the latest bad news about the dramatic decline of insect populations.         Another insect in serious trouble is the wild bee which has thousands of species. Nicotine-based pesticides called neonicotinoids are implicated in their decline but even if they were no longer used experts say bees monarchs and many other species of insect would still be in serious trouble.         ThatÂ€Â™s because of another major factor that has not been widely recognized: the precipitous loss of native vegetation across the United States.         Â€ÂœThereÂ€Â™s no question that the loss of habitat is hugeÂ€Âù said Douglas Tallamy a professor of entomology at the University of Delaware who has long warned of the perils of disappearing insects. Â€ÂœWe notice the monarch and bees because they are iconic insectsÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœBut what do you think is happening to everything else?Â€Âù         A big part of it is the way the United States farms. As the price of corn has soared in recent years driven by federal subsidies for biofuels farmers have expanded their fields. That has meant plowing every scrap of earth that can grow a corn plant including millions of acres of land once reserved in a federal program for conservation purposes.         Another major cause is farming with Roundup a herbicide that kills virtually all plants except crops that are genetically modified to survive it.         As a result millions of acres of native plants especially milkweed an important source of nectar for many species and vital for monarch butterfly larvae have been wiped out. One  The loss of bugs is no small matter. Insects help stitch together the web of life with essential services breaking plants down into organic matter for example and dispersing seeds. They are a prime source of food for birds. Critically some 80 percent of our food crops are pollinated by insects primarily the 4000 or so species of the flying dust mops called bees. Â€ÂœAll of them are in troubleÂ€Âù said Marla Spivak a professor of apiculture at the University of Minnesota.         Farm fields are not the only problem. Around the world people have replaced diverse natural habitat with the biological deserts that are roads parking lots and bluegrass lawns. Meanwhile the plants people choose for their yards are appealing for showy colors or shapes not for their ecological role. Studies show that native oak trees in the mid-Atlantic states host as many as 537 species of caterpillars which are important food for birds and other insects. Willows come in second with 456 species. Ginkgo on the other hand which is not native supports three species and zelkova an exotic plant used to replace elm trees that died from disease supports none. So the shelves are nearly bare for bugs and birds.         Native trees are not only grocery stores but insect pharmacies as well. Trees and other plants have beneficial chemicals essential to the health of bugs. Some monarchs when afflicted with parasites seek out more toxic types of milkweed because they kill the parasites. Bees use medicinal resins from aspen and willow trees that are antifungal antimicrobial and antiviral to line their nests and to fight infection and diseases. Â€ÂœBees scrape off the resins from the leaves which is kind of awesome stick them on their back legs and take them homeÂ€Âù said Dr. Spivak.         Besides pesticides and lack of habitat the other big problem bees face is disease. But these problems are not separate. Â€ÂœSay you have a bee with virusesÂ€Âù and they are run-down Dr. Spivak said. Â€ÂœAnd they are in a food desert and have to fly a long distance and when you find food it has complicated neurotoxins and the immune system just goes Â€Â˜uh-uh.Â€Â™ Or they become disoriented and canÂ€Â™t find their way home. ItÂ€Â™s too many stressors all at once.Â€Âù         There are numerous organizations and individuals dedicated to rebuilding native plant communities one sterile lawn and farm field at a time. Dr. Tallamy a longtime evangelizer for native plants and the author of one of the movementÂ€Â™s manuals Â€ÂœBringing Nature HomeÂ€Âù says itÂ€Â™s a cause everyone with a garden or yard can serve. And he says support for it needs to develop quickly to slow down the worsening crisis in biodiversity.         When the Florida Department of Transportation last year mowed down roadside wildflowers where monarch butterflies fed on their epic migratory journey Â€Âœthere was a huge outcryÂ€Âù said Eleanor Dietrich a wildflower activist in Florida. So much so transportation officials created a new policy that left critical insect habitat un-mowed.         That means reversing the hegemony of chemically green lawns. Â€ÂœIf youÂ€Â™ve got just lawn grass youÂ€Â™ve got nothingÂ€Âù said Mace Vaughan of the Xerces Society a leading organization in insect conservation. Â€ÂœBut as soon as you create a front yard wildflower meadow you go from an occasional honeybee to a lawn that might be full of 20 or 30 species of bees and butterflies and monarchs.Â€Âù         First and foremost said Dr. Tallamy a home for bugs is a matter of food security. Â€ÂœIf the bees were to truly disappear we would lose 80 percent of the plantsÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœThat is not an option. ThatÂ€Â™s a huge problem for mankind.Â€Âù        45,1E+14,1,Article,News,"Jacqueline Kennedyâ€™s Smart Pink Suit, Preserved in Memory and Kept Out of View",Fashion & Style,662,5.413,5.647,On the plane back to Washington in her pink Chanel suit caked with her husbandÂ€Â™s blood Jackie Kennedy resisted all suggestions from aides that she clean herself up. Instead she just said Â€ÂœLet them see what theyÂ€Â™ve done.Â€Âù         But for the half century since John F. KennedyÂ€Â™s assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22 1963 the most famous artifact from that day one of the most recognizable articles of clothing ever worn has been seen by almost no one. Now preserved by the National Archives in a climate-controlled vault outside of Washington it is subject to Kennedy family restrictions that it not be seen for almost a century more.         If there is a single item that captures both the shame and the violence that erupted that day and the glamour and artifice that preceded it it is Jackie KennedyÂ€Â™s bloodstained pink suit a tantalizing window on fame and fashion her allure and her steely resolve the things we know about her and the things we never quite will.         That Mrs. Kennedy is so closely linked to an item of clothing is fitting. In nearly three years as first lady she had gained universal celebrity for her youthful style. Politically it meant huge crowds whenever she accompanied the president. But for Mrs. Kennedy who felt vulnerable fashion gave her a sense of separation from the publicÂ€Â™s gaze. It was armor.         So even on that day before the horror of what ensued to look at Mrs. Kennedy was to be drawn inevitably to the pink suit a line-for-line copy of a classic cardigan-style Chanel with navy lapels. The suit came from Chez Ninon a Park Avenue salon that created many of her clothes following her taste for simple lines. She wore it at least six other times including on a 1962 visit to London and that same year to greet the prime minister of Algeria.         Fifty years ago at noon in Dallas Clint Hill who was the Secret Service agent assigned to Mrs. Kennedy thought the pink suit looked fluorescent against the dark blue of the car carrying the president and the first lady.         Â€ÂœShe stood out so much in the car because of the color of that suitÂ€Âù said Mr. Hill who has released a new account of the killing Â€ÂœFive Days in NovemberÂ€Âù in time for the anniversary. Â€ÂœIt was like the sun just illuminated it.Â€Âù         Now preserved in its vault the pink suit and its accessories still stained the stockings blood-powdered and folded in a white towel remain essentially unchanged from the day of the assassination. Only the outfitÂ€Â™s matching pillbox hat and white kid gloves are missing lost in the chaos of that day.         Although the National Archives has kept the suit and accessories including navy shoes bag and navy blouse since 1964 when they arrived in a dress box the items legally belonged after her death to Caroline Kennedy as her motherÂ€Â™s surviving heir. So a deed of gift was made in 2003 with the provision that the suit would not be seen by the public until 2103. Through her office Ms. Kennedy declined to comment.         Over the years the Kennedy family has sought to avoid the sensational treatment of assassination artifacts and that is the explicit intent of the 100-year restriction. Nonetheless Martha Murphy chief of special access at the archives said Mrs. KennedyÂ€Â™s clothes are the only items in the assassination collection with this specific restriction.         By comparison scholars and researchers who meet special criteria of the archives may view President KennedyÂ€Â™s clothing and the rifle used by Lee Harvey Oswald. To the best of anyoneÂ€Â™s knowledge access to Mrs. KennedyÂ€Â™s suit for research purposes has never been granted.         After Mrs. Kennedy returned to the White House early on Nov. 23 her clothing was put in a bag presumably by her personal maid Providencia Paredes and soon after placed in a dress box. Records show that it arrived at the archives sometime before July 1964 accompanied by an unsigned note on the stationery of Mrs. KennedyÂ€Â™s mother Janet Auchincloss.        78,1E+14,1,Article,Op-Ed,Donâ€™t Give More Patients Statins,Opinion,655,5.832,5.368,ON Tuesday the  This announcement is not a result of a sudden epidemic of heart disease nor is it based on new data showing the benefits of lower  The new guidelines among other things now recommend statins for people with a lower risk of heart disease (a 7.5 percent risk over the next 10 years compared with the previous guidelinesÂ€Â™ 10 to 20 percent risk) and for people with a risk of stroke. In addition they eliminate the earlier criteria that a patientÂ€Â™s Â€Âœbad cholesterolÂ€Âù or LDL be at or above a certain level. Although statins are no longer recommended for the small group of patients who were on the drugs only to lower their bad cholesterol eliminating the LDL criteria will mean a vast increase in prescriptions over all. According to our calculations it will increase the number of healthy people for whom statins are recommended by nearly 70 percent.         This may sound like good news for patients and it would be Â€Â” if statins actually offered meaningful protection from our No. 1 killer heart disease; if they helped people live longer or better; and if they had minimal adverse side effects. However none of these are the case.          At the same time 18 percent or more of this group would experience side effects including  Perhaps more dangerous statins provide false reassurances that may discourage patients from taking the steps that actually reduce cardiovascular disease. According to the World Health Organization 80 percent of cardiovascular disease is caused by smoking lack of exercise an unhealthy diet and other lifestyle factors. Statins give the illusion of protection to many people who would be much better served for example by simply walking an extra 10 minutes per day.         Aside from these concerns we have more reasons to be wary about the data behind this expansion of drug therapy.         When the last guidelines were issued by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in 2001 they nearly tripled the number of Americans for whom cholesterol-lowering drug therapy was recommended Â€Â” from 13 million to 36 million. These guidelines were reportedly based strictly on results from clinical trials. But this was contradicted by the data described in the document itself.         For example even though the guidelines recommended that women between the ages of 45 and 75 at increased risk of heart disease and with relatively high LDL levels take statins the fine print in the 284-page document admitted Â€ÂœClinical trials of LDL lowering generally are lacking for this risk category.Â€Âù The general lack of evidence for LDL level targets is why they have been dropped from the current guidelines. In fact committee members noted that cholesterol lowered by drugs may not have the same effect as cholesterol lowered by nondrug methods such as diet exercise and being lucky enough to have good genes.         The process by which these latest guidelines were developed gives rise to further skepticism. The group that wrote the recommendations was not sufficiently free of conflicts of interest; several of the experts on the panel have recent or current financial ties to drug makers. In addition both the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology while nonprofit entities are heavily supported by drug companies.         The American people deserve to have important medical guidelines developed by doctors and scientists on whom they can confidently rely to make judgments free from influence conscious or unconscious by the industries that stand to gain or lose.         We believe that the new guidelines are not adequately supported by objective data and that statins should not be recommended for this vastly expanded class of healthy Americans. Instead of converting millions of people into statin customers we should be focusing on the real factors that undeniably reduce the risk of heart disease: healthy diets exercise and avoiding smoking. Patients should be skeptical about the guidelines and have a meaningful dialogue with their doctors about statins including what the evidence does and does not show before deciding what is best for them.        72,1E+14,0,Article,News,Signals Upgraded for Curve in Track Where Metro-North Crash Occurred,N.Y. / Region,614,5.881,5.47,One week after a  Operators nearing the area just north of Spuyten Duyvil station will be warned of a reduced speed limit and the train will brake automatically if it is not traveling at or below 30 miles per hour inside the curve the authority said.         The authority said the new protections would be in place for all trains along that stretch of track by Monday morning.         The authority added that in response to an order from the Federal Railroad Administration it would reduce maximum allowable speeds at 26 locations on the Metro-North system eliminating all areas where the speed limit drops by more than 20 miles per hour.         Within the next year the authority added Â€ÂœalerterÂ€Âù systems Â€Â” which can detect operator inactivity sound an alarm and brake the train if no response is given Â€Â” will be present in every operatorÂ€Â™s cab. Alerter systems in the engineerÂ€Â™s position are present in two-thirds of the railroadÂ€Â™s fleet the authority said.         The Hudson line train that derailed on Dec. 1 had an alerter system in the locomotive but not in the front cab where the engineer apparently became dazed at the controls as the train approached the curve at 82 miles per hour.         The authority also said that by Tuesday morning conductors would stand with operators inside cabs to verbally confirm that speed limits are followed at potentially perilous curves. If a trainÂ€Â™s layout precludes this the authority said the two will communicate by radio.         The authority said Metro-North engineers were developing systems to automatically enforce speed restrictions at these curves by March and at five movable bridges on the New Haven line by September.         Changes in speed limit enforcement and allowable speeds are not expected to significantly affect rail schedules a spokesman said.         The authority must install a more advanced control system to help dictate speeds known as positive train control by 2015 according to a federal law. But the authority has called the technology Â€Âœuntested and unprovenÂ€Âù for commuter railroads as large and complex as Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road suggesting it will not meet the deadline.         Earlier on Sunday Senators  Â€ÂœThis isnÂ€Â™t the first time that fatigue has been linked to a serious accidentÂ€Âù Mr. Schumer said at a news conference at  Mr. Schumer acknowledged that it was unclear whether cameras would have prevented the derailment but he said the cameras could alert train operators to track problems and deter drivers from texting or nodding off during trips. Amtrak locomotives already carry exterior cameras he said.         Anticipating that Metro-North officials would protest that they lacked the funds to install the cameras Mr. Blumenthal added Â€ÂœShame on Metro-North as well for objecting to these common-sense measures on the basis of dollars.Â€Âù         Unions for bus and train operators have previously objected to cameras citing driversÂ€Â™ privacy. In a statement the Association of Commuter Rail Employees said that inward cameras Â€Âœwill not protect rider safety in the event of human error or health emergency.Â€Âù        88,1E+14,0,Article,News,"With New Formula, an Official Helped Unmask the Face of Poverty in New York",N.Y. / Region,748,5.509,5.505,Over and over again Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio has hammered it home: Forty-six percent of New Yorkers are poor or nearly poor. It is his mantra the figure he holds up as proof that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has failed nearly half of his citizens.         Yet the man who came up with that statistic is no Democratic operative. He is a wry bespectacled Bloomberg administration official who is far more familiar with complex statistical methodologies than with rough-and-tumble political brawling.         His name is Mark K. Levitan and he is Mr. BloombergÂ€Â™s director of poverty research. Over the past five years he has completely transformed how New York City measures poverty.         His new formula for counting the needy more than doubled the percentage of people categorized as near poor bringing millions of low-wage workers their families and others out of the statistical shadows.         Not exactly the news that most mayoral aides are eager to share with their boss. The figures inspired grumbles at City Hall where some lamented that Dr. LevitanÂ€Â™s research had become a bludgeon to bash the mayor.         But Linda I. Gibbs Mr. BloombergÂ€Â™s deputy mayor for health and human services praised Dr. Levitan for helping to reveal Â€Âœthe actual face of povertyÂ€Âù in the city which she emphasized was precisely what the mayor wanted.         Dr. Levitan said Mr. Bloomberg Â€ÂœdidnÂ€Â™t flinchÂ€Âù when he told him what he expected from the new approach.         Â€ÂœHe wasnÂ€Â™t happy to hear we were going to say there was more povertyÂ€Âù Dr. Levitan said recalling early conversations with the mayor. Â€ÂœBut he didnÂ€Â™t suppress it. I had the ability to put the numbers out with integrity.Â€Âù         What Dr. Levitan did was bold and straightforward: He threw out the federal poverty measure used by the Census Bureau in favor of a new one that takes into account the high cost of living in this city quantifying for the first time the toll of expenses like housing medical costs and child care.         The new methodology introduced in 2008 and based on recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences also factored in noncash benefits such as food stamps and tax credits.         What emerged was a new landscape of hardship. Poverty dipped in places like the South Bronx and hardscrabble corners of Brooklyn where subsidized housing and government assistance cushion the poorest of the poor. But it rose in places like Queens and Staten Island where low-wage workers struggle to pay market-rate rents earning too much to qualify for most benefits but too little to get by.         Â€ÂœIt changes to a degree our vision of poverty across neighborhoodsÂ€Âù Dr. Levitan said. Â€ÂœPoverty is less concentrated geographically. It is more widespread across the city.Â€Âù         That kind of talk might give any mayor heartburn. But Dr. Levitan 65 who spent a decade as an analyst at the  In 2010 the Obama administration said it would adopt a version of New YorkÂ€Â™s model as a companion to the federal formula. In April when Dr. Levitan issued his annual report Mr. de Blasio took notice.         Mr. BloombergÂ€Â™s aides and others say the mayor deserves credit for creating the  But Mr. de Blasio and others say more needed to be done. The fact remains according to Dr. LevitanÂ€Â™s measure that poverty is higher than it was in 2008 which highlights the challenges facing the incoming mayor.         How do you help the working poor if wages are low and few obvious revenue sources to significantly expand affordable housing exist?         Â€ÂœThe question isÂ€Âù Dr. Levitan said Â€Âœhow are we going to find other resources?Â€Âù         We will have to wait and see. Dr. Levitan is not sure what his future holds in the new administration. But he hopes the research will continue.         Dr. Levitan who recently moved from Hoboken N.J. to brownstone Brooklyn remains keenly aware of those who do not share in his world of urban prosperity the New Yorkers who are Â€Âœon the outside looking in.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœClearlyÂ€Âù he said Â€Âœthe divide is there.Â€Âù        178,1E+14,0,Article,News,No. 13 Oregon Beats Mississippi 115-105 in OT,Sports,324,5.45,5.301,OXFORD Miss.

Johnathan Loyd added 23 points and Joseph Young had 19 including an important 3-pointer in overtime to push the Ducks (8-0) ahead 100-93 with 1:59 remaining.         Six Oregon players scored in double figures during an entertaining game that stayed close throughout. The Ducks shot 38 of 65 (58.5 percent) percent from the field.         Marshall Henderson had a career-high 39 points for Ole Miss (6-2). The 6-foot-2 guard made 11 of 27 shots from the field including 10 of 23 from 3-point range.         The final minute of regulation was wild with Ole Miss hitting three difficult 3-pointers in the last 40 seconds to climb out of an 86-80 hole. Henderson made two and Jarvis Summers nailed an off-balance 22-footer to tie it at 89 with 0.8 seconds left.         The Rebels even had a chance to win in regulation after Oregon threw its inbounds pass out of bounds but Henderson's last gasp 3-pointer clanged off the rim.         Henderson bounced back from a terrible 4-of-18 shooting night Thursday night in a loss to Kansas State.         But it wasn't enough to top the Ducks who simply couldn't miss for most of the afternoon. The 6-foot-8 Moser made 8 of 13 shots from the field alternating drives to the basket with 3-pointers and Loyd had 15 assists and made 14 of 16 free throws.         The Rebels stayed even with the Ducks because of tough post play from Demarco Cox and Aaron Jones and timely outside shooting from Henderson Summers and LaDarius White.         Ole Miss pushed out to a 62-55 advantage on Henderson's 3-pointer with 9:07 remaining but the Ducks never flinched. Moser had 10 points in a row midway through the second half single-handedly pushing Oregon ahead 67-65.

The area around Pigalle in particular Â€Â” which American G.I.Â€Â™s aptly called Â€ÂœPig AlleyÂ€Âù Â€Â” was always a mixture of both its seediness informing the artistic production and spirit of numerous generations of inhabitants. You can see it in  But itÂ€Â™s disappearing. Today the neighborhood has been rechristened Â€ÂœSouth PigalleÂ€Âù or in a disheartening aping of New York SoPi. Organic grocers tasteful bistros and an influx of upscale American cocktail bars are quietly displacing the pharmacies dry cleaners and scores of seedy bar ÃƒÂ  hÃƒÂ´tesses that for decades have defined the neighborhood.         These Â€Âœhostess barsÂ€Âù marked by barely dressed women perched in the windows are the direct descendants of the regulated brothels that thrived here from NapoleonÂ€Â™s time until the postwar purge of the 1940s. The French daily LibÃƒÂ©ration  When my wife and I first moved here in 2011 I wasnÂ€Â™t sure what to make of living in the middle of a functioning red-light district. Our neighborhood though safe and well on its way to gentrification remained funky in the original sense of the term. In addition to cigarette smoke and baking bread there was the whiff of dirt and sex in the air. It took a while for me to get used to the tap-tapping on windows Â€Â” or hissing and tongue clicking from open doors Â€Â” that greeted me as I passed the bars on my way to fill a prescription or buy a bottle of Pouilly-FumÃƒÂ©.         I have never quite gotten used to the transsexual hookers who traipse the Boulevard de Clichy outside the areaÂ€Â™s various sex shops and with whom I must share the carnivalesque sidewalk on my way in and out of the post office. Frankly they make me uncomfortable.         But IÂ€Â™ve come to see that unease as a good thing the longer I stay in this corner of France a country where the worldÂ€Â™s oldest profession continues to enjoy a special patrimonial status and where try as it might the government canÂ€Â™t seem to un-sew that tawdry patch from the national quilt.

Instead of giving the kind of not-in-my-backyard glare I imagined her Park Slope counterpart might unleash she just asked the masseuse for a light. They shared a few friendly words before going their separate ways leaving me to wonder why I thought that should be odd.         SUCH encounters are getting rarer by the week but they remind me that genuinely engaging with an urban space means encountering and making room for an assortment of lifestyles and social realities Â€Â” some appealing some provocative and some repulsive. This is what the Situationists meant by psychogeography or as Guy Debord put it the Â€Âœspecific effects of the geographical environment (whether consciously organized or not) on the emotions and behavior of individuals.Â€Âù         Down the street where Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec once had his studio you now must pass a store called  From there a left turn puts you at the intersection of Rue Victor MassÃƒÂ© and Rue Frochot where in the space of one half-block three hostess bars have recently been shuttered and reopened as upscale cocktail lounges.

For the Taiwan-born designer Cindy Chao creating jewelry is an art that she practices much like a traditional sculptor drafting the concept hand shaping the wax prototype and lost-wax casting the model.         Â€ÂœI consider myself a sculptor who uses precious stones and metals as primary materialsÂ€Âù Ms. Chao said in an interview in Paris.         With a sculptor as a father and an architect as a grandfather Ms. Chao developed early an eye for proportion and volume: Â€ÂœI grew up in a family of designers working with three-dimensional creationsÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœI was trained to see jewelry as an art piece to be perfected from all angles.Â€Âù         In September Ms. Chao previewed some of her new pieces in Paris together with a few from past collections on loan from collectors during the Haute Couture fashion week.         Â€ÂœSince many of my creations are one-of-a-kind we had to borrow a few pieces from clientsÂ€Âù she said.         Ms. Chao designs two collections a year. Her signature Â€ÂœFour SeasonsÂ€Âù collection consists of a set of Â€ÂœBlack Label MasterpiecesÂ€Âù limited to 36 per year and a more accessible Â€ÂœWhite LabelÂ€Âù line.         Â€ÂœEach piece in the Black Label is handcrafted over at least two yearsÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœI make the first sketch and hand sculpt the wax mold and oversee all the finishing touches all done by hand.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœIt is difficult to make two identical pieces because exceptional stones like this Colombian emerald are impossible to find todayÂ€Âù Ms. Chao said pointing to a 60-carat pear-shaped stone set in one of her signature pieces a convertible necklace that could be disassembled with the pendant worn as a brooch.         The Black Label collection is sold in Taipei and Beijing by appointment and through invitation-only viewings in New York London and Paris. Prices for the individual pieces range from $500000 to $10 million.         Pieces in the White Label Â€Âœentry levelÂ€Âù line are priced from $10000 to $100000.         Until recently part of the White Label collection was available through Bergdorf Goodman the high-end department store in New York. But she could not keep up with the demand.         Â€ÂœBergdorfÂ€Â™s required a certain volume each season but we could not maintain the level and speed of production to match that demand so we are taking a break for a couple of seasonsÂ€Âù Ms. Chao said. Â€ÂœThere are both advantages and disadvantages to not being mass produced.Â€Âù         In nearly a decade Ms. Chao 39 has become one of the worldÂ€Â™s most remarkable independent jewelry designers.         Â€ÂœThere are no outside investors for now in my companyÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœI may consider the option for international expansion but it would have to be someone who shares my philosophy and is not in just to make money.Â€Âù         She started designing in 2004 when she founded her company Cindy Chao: The Art Jewel after returning to Taipei from New York where she studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology and the Gemological Institute of America.         Â€ÂœSchool did not help me much with the work I am doing nowÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœWe were not taught hand sculpting there Â€Â” it was mostly my familyÂ€Â™s influence.Â€Âù         Today she lives and works between Taipei and Hong Kong while traveling often to Geneva to oversee the final stages of the manufacturing of her pieces which is done in Switzerland.         Something about her designs retains an eastern feel Â€Â” perhaps the naturalistic detailed rendition of her organic shapes with a penchant for the asymmetrical rooted in a tradition of Asian landscape painting.         While Ms. ChaoÂ€Â™s themes Â€Â” the butterfly the ribbon or floral motifs Â€Â” remain largely traditional the modernity of her jewelry comes from their settings and the surprisingly light weight of her pieces.        16,1E+14,0,Article,News,A Luxury Phone Designed for Women,Fashion & Style,1126,6.021,5.983,Paris Â€Â” The market for status-symbol smartphone jewelry became a little more crowded in July with the birth of Savelli a brand aiming to capture a niche previously unexplored by other competitors.         Â€ÂœOur smartphone is a modern piece of jewelry and the first phone designed exclusively for womenÂ€Âù said Alessandro Savelli chief executive and co-founder of the brand in an interview in Paris.         Since 2008 players like Motorola Aura Modelabs Christian Dior Tag Heuer Goldvish and Ulysse Nardin have brought out luxury mobile phones to compete with the industry leader Vertu.         But no brand had designed a phone specifically for sophisticated A-list women.         Â€ÂœWhen it comes to women high-end mobile phone brands practice the Â€Â˜pink it and shrink itÂ€Â™ approach which consists in taking menÂ€Â™s models as a base design instead of a completely new conceptÂ€Âù said Ketty Pucci-Sisti Maisonrouge who co-founded the brand with Mr. Savelli.         In her book Â€ÂœThe Luxury AlchemistÂ€Âù published in September Ms. Pucci-Sisti Maisonrouge tells how the team behind Savelli carried out extensive research to create an avatar of the woman whose tastes and spending habits would lead her to the Savelli phone.         Â€ÂœWe embarked on the Savelli adventure with a clear vision of our client: She was international in-the-know confident and didnÂ€Â™t take herself too seriouslyÂ€Âù Ms. Pucci-Sisti Maisonrouge wrote.         After a debut in July in London the Savelli phone was rolled out again during the Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week in September with a glossy party at the Jacquemart-AndrÃƒÂ© Museum.         Their first collection titled Â€ÂœJardin SecretÂ€Âù consists of 11 models assembled in Switzerland to rigorous technical standards. Almond-shaped and highly tactile they feature rich smooth metals and polished ceramics precious stones exotic skins and an ultradomed sapphire crystal glass: Â€ÂœWe wanted to create a shape that was feminine curvaceous and at the same time extremely modernÂ€Âù Mr. Savelli said.         Â€ÂœThe basic design of the phone was inspired by William HogarthÂ€Â™s Â€Â˜Line of GraceÂ€ÂùÂ€Â™ he said referring to the 18th-century writer and artist whose book Â€ÂœThe Analysis of BeautyÂ€Âù expounded on the aesthetic values of the S-shaped serpentine line. Â€ÂœIn nature there are only curves and soft angles so we decided that the best shape for this object of beauty was curved.Â€Âù         Born of English and Italian parents Mr. Savelli grew up in a family of jewelers in Vicenza Italy. While attending Columbia Business School he met Ms. Pucci-Sisti Maisonrouge an Italian-born luxury branding expert and an adjunct professor teaching a course on luxury marketing at the school.         Together they started Savelli with financial support from some experienced players in the luxury goods market: Â€ÂœThe company is financed by two institutional venture capital funds Rho Ventures and Innogest and a group of executives some formerly with De Beers LVMH Svedka Vodka Gianfranco FerrÃƒÂ© and EMI MusicÂ€Âù Mr. Savelli said.         Rho Ventures is a technology investor based in New York City; Palo Alto Calif.; and Montreal. Innogest is based in Italy.         Like Vertu the market leader in the luxury sector the brand does not aim for technical superiority. Â€ÂœFrom the beginning we agreed with VertuÂ€Â™s approach: Our phone would not need to be revolutionary in its technologyÂ€Âù Ms. Pucci-Sisti Maisonrouge wrote. Â€ÂœOther companies were better positioned to do that.Â€Âù         Savelli phones run on Android technology with a touch screen and custom-made graphics and sounds. Many features are amusing Â€Â” the Â€ÂœunlockÂ€Âù button features handcuffs and the flashlight application a chandelier icon.         Â€ÂœWe completely changed the look and feel of the Android system with redesigned icons and our sound files were all custom designed by the DJ StÃƒÂ©phane PompougnacÂ€Âù Mr. Savelli said referring to the celebrity French disc jockey and record producer.         An exclusive concierge service Â€Â” included as a feature Â€Â” picks up the userÂ€Â™s location via GPS and can make suggestions as to venues and events to suit the userÂ€Â™s profile.        58,1E+14,0,Article,News,Eagles Rally by Keeping It Simple in the Snow,Sports,676,5.432,5.399,PHILADELPHIA Â€Â” When a driving snow arrived a couple of hours earlier than predicted and continued throughout the opening half the  Coach Chip Kelly shortened his list of offensive plays while determining that he could not use the kicking game for field goals or extra points. Quarterback Nick Foles effective in the shotgun as the N.F.C.Â€Â™s offensive player of the month in November moved under center. And LeSean McCoy acted like a child romping in his backyard as he abandoned his usual array of wide runs to make one breathtaking dash after another between the tackles and through the snow.         McCoy carried 29 times for a team-record 217 yards and 2 touchdowns Â€Â” on jaunts of 40 and 57 yards as part of a 28-point fourth quarter Â€Â” and the Eagles rallied to beat the  Philadelphia was held to 90 net yards and trailed by 8-0 at halftime before it got on track. McCoy rushed 16 times for 166 yards in the second half in eclipsing the franchise single-game rushing record which had stood since Nov. 27 1949 when Steve Van Buren a Hall of Fame back amassed 205 yards against Pittsburgh.         According to McCoy the move away from lateral runs was not difficult. Â€ÂœI like to run between the tackles; you can see your holesÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœThe guys up front gave me so much room to work. Tremendous credit goes to those guys.Â€Âù         Detroit anchored defensively by tackles Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley began the afternoon ranked third in the N.F.L. in allowing only 82.7 rushing yards a game. But Philadelphia center Jason Kelce flanked by right guard Todd Herremans and left guard Evan Mathis consistently allowed McCoy to break through the line of scrimmage cleanly. McCoy somehow dashed and darted and showed how much he could make of those openings no matter how unsure the footing.         Â€ÂœSometimes I couldnÂ€Â™t really plantÂ€Âù McCoy said. Â€ÂœI can usually plant on a dime. But it all worked out.Â€Âù         Philadelphia improved to 8-5 6-2 since Foles took over at quarterback and at least briefly nudged ahead in the N.F.C. East. Dallas (7-5) will visit Chicago (6-6) on Monday night. Philadelphia travels to Dallas on Dec. 29 for the teamsÂ€Â™ regular-season finale.         Detroit an unsteady N.F.C. North leader at 7-6 wasted a 58-yard punt return for a score by Jeremy Ross in the third quarter and a 98-yard kick return by Ross for a 20-14 lead with 14 minutes 20 seconds left in the fourth. David Akers in the lone kicking attempt at a conversion had his low boot blocked.         Foles had thrown 19 touchdowns without being intercepted before Sunday one touchdown shy of the record set this season by Peyton Manning of the Denver Broncos. His bid to tie Manning fell short when the conditions got the best of him. A slick ball contributed to an overthrow that Lions cornerback Chris Houston intercepted and returned 30 yards to PhiladelphiaÂ€Â™s 20 early in the second quarter. That positioned the Lions for the only score of the opening half. Five plays later Joique Bell banged in from 2 yards out.         Foles shook it off and so did his resilient teammates. Â€ÂœI know a lot of hype has been made about the touchdown-to-interception ratioÂ€Âù said Foles in his second season. Â€ÂœI donÂ€Â™t even worry about it. I worry about wins.Â€Âù         Foles hit half his 22 passes for 179 yards and a touchdown a 19-yard toss to DeSean Jackson that brought the Eagles back from a 14-0 deficit with 4:05 left in the third quarter. Foles misfired in attempting a 2-point conversion.         The LionsÂ€Â™ Matthew Stafford connected on 10 of 25 throws for 148 yards.

The results are at  The Senior Mixed Pairs which ended on Thursday had a seesaw conclusion for two married couples Ginny and Jeff Schuett of Riverwoods Ill. and Sandra and Doug Fraser of Victoria British Columbia. Originally the Frasers thought they had won by the smallest possible margin 0.01 matchpoints. The Frasers were up and the Schuetts were down.         However Mel Colchamiro of Merrick N.Y. thought his session score was too high. He checked the results and saw that he and his partner Ruth Grant of Tarrytown N.Y. had been credited with plus 120 on a board when they were minus 120. When that correction was made the Schuetts went from losing by 0.01 matchpoints to winning by 0.99. The Schuetts were up and the Frasers were down.         A sacrifice is a contract that you know will fail. You hope to concede fewer points than the opponents would have scored in their best contract. It can be a very profitable move in a pair tournament.         The diagramed deal occurred during the final session of the Senior Mixed. After Ginny Schuett (North) passed and East opened one spade Jeff Schuett (South) noting the favorable vulnerability made a bold three-club weak jump overcall. It wasnÂ€Â™t textbook because his suit was weak and he had what looked like two defensive tricks on the side.         West might have responded three diamonds but chose to show his spade support with a four-club cue-bid. North with such a weak hand was happy to up the ante to five clubs. In the rest of the auction no one was sure who could make what but in the end North judged correctly to sacrifice in seven clubs.         When the dummy came down South thought he might have been able to take two heart tricks against six spades. Jeff Schuett was down.         When he found out that West had only one heart he realized six spades was laydown for plus 1430. He was up again.         Seven clubs doubled went down five. (If West played three rounds of trumps to stop two diamond ruffs in the dummy South would have taken three hearts four clubs and one diamond ruff. Alternatively if West waited to collect three trump tricks South could take two diamond ruffs in the dummy.)         Minus 1100 was worth 56.5 out of 64 matchpoints.        87,1E+14,0,Article,News,"New, Bigger and Bolder â€˜Tâ€™ Logo Adorns a â€˜Model Cabâ€™ That Has an Uncertain Future",N.Y. / Region,617,5.332,5.672,Reading lights.

The traffic cones and Â€Âœunder constructionÂ€Âù signs alongside SagaÂ€Â™s roads and waterways are about the only visible change brought about by Â€ÂœAbenomicsÂ€Âù Prime Minister Shinzo AbeÂ€Â™s much-lauded plan to put Japan back on the path to growth. Residents here say the building boom is a throwback to JapanÂ€Â™s troubled 1990s when far-flung regions across the country tried to build their way back to prosperity.         And they worry that like previous attempts growth will not last.         Â€ÂœHow long before all this winds down again? ThatÂ€Â™s what everyoneÂ€Â™s worried aboutÂ€Âù said Masataka Matsuo a construction worker reinforcing an irrigation ditch several miles away from the city center.         Japan has been the worldÂ€Â™s surprising growth story this year largely outpacing other major industrialized countries with a bold set of policies that are lifting its economy after years of deflation. So far it has been Mr. AbeÂ€Â™s bid to pump the nationÂ€Â™s banks with money Â€Â” together with his promises of wide-ranging market reforms Â€Â” that have garnered much of the investor spotlight.         But some economists say that JapanÂ€Â™s recovery has become dangerously dependent on large-scale public works spending remembered here for adding to JapanÂ€Â™s debt burden fueling pork-barrel politics and riddling the country with little-used roads bridges and dams.         On Thursday the government announced new stimulus spending of 5.5 trillion yen much of it for public works in a bid to offset any negative public reaction to a coming increase in a national sales tax.         Still pouring money into infrastructure projects will do little to lift JapanÂ€Â™s growth potential in the long term some economists warn. And with limited evidence that monetary easing is in fact lifting the real economy growth Â€Âœrisks falling off a cliffÂ€Âù when government outlays sputter said Chotaro Morita chief strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo.         Recent figures seem to support this view. In the three months through September consumer spending grew a mere 0.2 percent from the last quarter and capital investment was flat despite the easy money available under JapanÂ€Â™s ultra-loose monetary policy. Net exports fell 0.6 percent.         Even the rise of the stock market Â€Â” up almost 50 percent since the start of the year largely because exportersÂ€Â™ earnings are higher Â€Â” has not helped average people spend more.         Instead it has been government spending on public works that has lifted growth expanding at a rapid clip of 6.5 percent from the previous quarter the latest numbers show. Overall growth for the quarter was revised to just 0.3 percent from the previous three months down from an initial reading of 0.5 percent.         Â€ÂœJapanÂ€Â™s growth engine has been massive government spendingÂ€Âù Ryutaro Kono economist for BNP Paribas said in a recent note.         Saga a small prefecture of about 850000 people knows all about government largess. Construction was abundant here during the Lost Decade 1990s as Japan sought to fend off recession with a huge public works drive that in some years topped the entire military budget of the United States.         Saga built a new airport dammed nearly all its river systems and opened a 200-acre landscaped park with a shiny visitor center and almost 100 historical buildings. At the peak of the building frenzy one in nine workers in Saga worked in construction.         But from the early 2000s a reformist prime minister started to reduce spending leaving regions like Saga in the lurch. The Democratic Party which took the countryÂ€Â™s helm in 2009 declared that Japan would further shift its resources Â€Âœfrom concrete to people.Â€Âù By 2012 public investment had declined to a third of its peak in 1998. Almost a fifth of SagaÂ€Â™s construction companies closed or went out of business. The local economy plummeted.        91,1E+14,1,Article,News,Medicaid Growth Could Aggravate Doctor Shortage,U.S.,612,5.542,5.564,SAN DIEGO Â€Â” Dr. Ted Mazer is one of the few ear nose and throat specialists in this region who treat low-income people on Medicaid so many of his patients travel long distances to see him.         But now as CaliforniaÂ€Â™s Medicaid program is preparing for a  Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s a bad situation that is likely to be made worseÂ€Âù he said.         His view is shared by many doctors around the country. Medicaid for years has struggled with a shortage of doctors willing to accept its low reimbursement rates and red tape forcing many patients to wait for care particularly from specialists like Dr. Mazer.         Yet in just five weeks millions of additional Americans will be covered by the program many of them older people with an array of health problems. The Community clinics which typically provide primary but not specialty care have expanded and hired more medical staff members to meet the anticipated wave of new patients. And managed-care companies are recruiting doctors nurse practitioners and other professionals into their networks sometimes offering higher pay if they improve care while keeping costs down. But it is far from clear that the demand can be met experts say.         In California with the nationÂ€Â™s largest Medicaid population many doctors say they are already overwhelmed and are unable to take on more low-income patients. Dr. Hector Flores a primary care doctor in East Los Angeles whose practice has 26000 patients more than a third of whom are on Medicaid said he could accommodate an additional 1000 Medicaid patients at most.         Â€ÂœThere could easily be 10000 patients looking for us and weÂ€Â™re just not going to be able to serve themÂ€Âù said Dr. Flores who is also the chairman of the family medicine department at White Memorial Medical Center in Los Angeles.         California officials say they are confident that access will not be an issue. But the state is expecting to add as many as two million people to its Medicaid rolls over the next two years Â€Â” far more than any other state. They will be joining more than seven million people who are already in the program here. One million of the newly eligible will probably be enrolled by July 2014 said Mari Cantwell an official with the stateÂ€Â™s Department of Health Care Services.         On top of that only about 57 percent of doctors in California accept new Medicaid patients according to  Â€ÂœThe symbolism is horribleÂ€Âù said Lisa Folberg a vice president of the California Medical Association.         The health care law seeks to diminish any access problem by allowing for a two-year increase in the Medicaid payment rate for primary care doctors set to expire at the end of 2014. The average increase is 73 percent bringing Medicaid rates to the level of Medicare rates for these doctors.         But states have been slow to put the pay increase into effect experts say and because of the delay and the fact that the increase is temporary fewer doctors than hoped have joined the ranks of those accepting Medicaid patients.         Â€ÂœThereÂ€Â™s been a lot of confusion and a really slow rolloutÂ€Âù Ms. Folberg said Â€Âœwhich unfortunately mitigated some of the positive effects.Â€Âù         Adding to the expansion of the Medicaid rolls is a phenomenon that experts are calling the Â€Âœwoodwork effectÂ€Âù in which people who had been eligible for Medicaid even before the Affordable Care Act are enrolling now because they have learned about the program through publicity about the new law. As a result Medicaid rolls are growing even in states like Florida and Texas that are not expanding the program under the law.         Managed-care companies that serve the Medicaid population here through contracts with the state are still hustling to recruit more doctors and other providers to treat the new enrollees.        183,1E+14,0,Article,News,Philip Rivers Helps Chargers Beat Giants 37-14,Sports,864,5.014,5.546,"SAN DIEGO Â€Â” Philip Rivers and the San Diego Chargers still have Eli Manning's number.         Not the one briefly issued to Manning at the 2004 NFL draft of course. Just another victory against him.         Rivers found rookie Keenan Allen for two of his three touchdown passes and the Chargers beat Manning and the New York Giants 37-14 on Sunday.         The Chargers (6-7) kept alive their long-shot playoff hopes and helped eliminate the Giants (5-8) from the playoff picture.         ""If you said we were going to be one game out of a playoff berth with three games to play it wouldn't be ideal but I think we would sign up for that"" said Rivers who led the Chargers to just their second win in the last six games.         Manning dropped to 0-3 against San Diego since 2004 when the Chargers took him with the No. 1 overall draft pick and then sent him a short time later to the Giants for Rivers and a handful of draft picks.         Manning was booed all day by fans who still remember the sleight they felt when Archie Manning in the days before that draft asked the Chargers not to take his son.         And now the Giants are out of the playoff hunt.         ""That's not what the goal was"" Manning said. ""This organization and this team expects to make the playoffs and be in contention for championships and obviously to know that with three games to go it's disappointing. Today's loss was a tough one.""         The Chargers felt they played their most complete game of the year. They rushed for 144 yards including 103 yards on 29 carries by Ryan Mathews.         New York cornerback Jayron Hosley said the Chargers ""came out fighting and came out ready to play. We came out kind of flat. We started to pick it up at times but we took too many blows.""         Said Allen: ""I think we got on top of these guys pretty early and put them out their misery. They didn't really want to play anymore.""         Manning was picked off twice the first time when Donald Butler came up with a deflected pass midway through the first quarter. Three plays later Allen got open for a 43-yard play that he completed by lunging for the pylon for the score.         Allen had three catches to push his season total to 61 breaking LaDainian Tomlinson's team rookie record of 59 in 2001.         Rivers was 21 of 28 for 249 yards before being replaced by Charlie Whitehurst with more than five minutes left.         Manning was 20 of 32 for 259 yards with one TD.         Allen also had a 4-yard TD catch and Danny Woodhead grabbed a 6-yard scoring reception.         Manning also lost to the Chargers in 2005 when Drew Brees was still their starting quarterback and in 2009 when Rivers threw three touchdown passes including a last-minute game-winner to Vincent Jackson.         Asked if the fans affected Manning Giants coach Tom Coughlin said: ""I don't think so at all. I think their team affected us.""         New York lost for just the second time in seven games following an 0-6 start.         The Chargers are tied with the New York Jets one game behind Baltimore and Miami in the race for the second AFC wild-card spot. The Chargers visit Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos on Thursday night. The Broncos beat the Chargers 28-20 on Nov. 10.         Allen was hurt while making a 12-yard catch late in the first quarter and went into the locker room. He returned late in the second quarter and caught his second scoring pass to give San Diego a 17-0 lead.         Allen said he had an X-ray on his shoulder which was negative and then got a pain-killing shot before going back into the game.         ""My shoulder's fine"" he said. ""I just fell too hard just trying to dive and get away from the contact but I ended up hurting myself.""         A 36-yard field goal by Nick Novak and Rivers' TD pass to Woodhead Â€Â” which was set up by Marcus Gilchrist's recovery of Andre Brown's fumble Â€Â” helped the Chargers take a 24-0 halftime lead.         The Chargers blew a 24-0 halftime lead to Peyton Manning and the Broncos last year but weren't about to do to same to Manning's little brother and the Giants.         Rivers was sacked by Justin Tuck and fumbled on the first possession of the second half with Cullen Jenkins recovering at the 18 to set up Peyton Hillis' 1-yard scoring run.         Rivers appeared to injure his neck when he dove for the loose ball but stayed in the game.         Mathews scored on a 1-yard run to cap an 11-play 80-yard drive that was all on the ground except for a pass from Rivers to Vincent Brown that drew a 36-yard pass interference call against linebacker Spencer Paysinger.         Manning threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Myers and Novak added field goals of 27 and 43 yards all in the fourth quarter.

Instead of landing in the end zone Nicks was on the turf at the 6 the throw from Manning another in the long list of Giants efforts that have fallen short this season. The flickering playoff hopes the Giants harbored as the day began expired in a hail of mistakes and misfortune in a 37-14 trouncing by San Diego.         The loss in conjunction with victories by Philadelphia and Arizona eliminated the Giants from playoff contention with three weeks to play.         Â€ÂœWe created our situation hereÂ€Âù  The Giants had gamely given life to their season by winning five of their previous six games but it was not so much a transformation as it was a case study in resiliency. They still were guilty of turnovers and mental errors but they mostly overcame them. And rediscovering the sort of physical line play that had given birth to a pair of Super Bowl runs added to their rejuvenation.         But on Sunday the Giants put themselves in an early hole and kept on digging. A tipped pass was intercepted Â€Â” one of three turnovers Â€Â” and three plays later  Â€ÂœWe couldnÂ€Â™t get out of that funkÂ€Âù linebacker Jon Beason said. Â€ÂœIt was demoralizing.Â€Âù         Nobody had more reason to be demoralized than Manning. The two interceptions pushed his season total to 20 tying him with the Jets rookie Geno Smith for the most in the N.F.L. He was also sacked twice hit on five other occasions and outplayed by Rivers with whom he has been linked since their 2004 draft day trade.         The image of Manning standing glumly on the stage at Radio City Music Hall held hostage by a team he did not want to play for has never been forgotten by Chargers fan who booed him nearly as vociferously as they did in 2006 when a much-better Chargers team walloped the Giants. Manning also lost to San Diego in 2009 when Rivers led a last-minute scoring drive in a 21-20 win.         Fans in the upper deck serenaded Manning with an off-color chant and a poster of Manning with earrings makeup and womanÂ€Â™s haircut was shown on the video board. Stay classy San Diego it wasnÂ€Â™t. But neither did it seem to bother Manning.         He was more bothered by the loss of playoff hope.         Â€ÂœTo know that three games to go is disappointingÂ€Âù Manning said. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s not an ideal situation but weÂ€Â™ve got to be strong about it be men about it and do our job.Â€Âù         Manning was not the only one with regrets.         When the Giants caught a rare break Â€Â” Justin TuckÂ€Â™s poking the ball from RiversÂ€Â™s hand on the first play of the second half Â€Â” it was short-lived. The Giants closed the gap to 24-7 on Peyton HillisÂ€Â™s 1-yard scoring plunge. But after sacking Rivers they chose to rush only three and Rivers picked out Antonio Gates for 15 yards to convert third-and-12.         Then linebacker Spencer Paysinger who was caught matched up with receiver Vincent Brown on RiversÂ€Â™s long heave into the end zone reached out and grabbed Brown when the pass was underthrown. It turned out to be a 47-yard penalty giving the Chargers the ball at the 1 which was close enough for Ryan Mathews to score with an off-tackle run boosting San DiegoÂ€Â™s lead to 31-7 and ending any suspense.         Â€ÂœIt was frustrating today to have to be questioned whereÂ€Â™s our enthusiasmÂ€Âù Tuck said. Â€ÂœObviously if you give yourself a 24-point deficit on the road against a good football team itÂ€Â™s wishful thinking youÂ€Â™re going to come back from that most of the time.Â€Âù         There was not much left for the Giants to do. They could not stop Mathews who became the first opponent since September to rush for 100 yards. They could not get the ChargersÂ€Â™ offense off the field very often allowing it to convert on 10 of 15 third downs. And they could not force more than a single turnover.         All that was left was to play out the rest of the game something they will be forced to do from the start over the final three weeks.         And all that is very likely to come from that is a few more signature moments like the one that occurred Sunday on a play that was inconsequential. Though it did not determine the GiantsÂ€Â™ fate it epitomized it.         Rivers knowing that the Giants had jumped offside chucked a pass downfield. In these situations in the past he has had tall receivers like Gates the injured Malcom Floyd or the departed Vincent Jackson. Now he had the smallest player on the field 5-foot-8 Danny Woodhead streaking down the field.         Giants cornerback Jayron Hosley far down the depth chart at a depleted position leapt twice to try to knock the ball away. Instead it landed in the hands of Woodhead just another moment that required the Giants to stand tall and they could not.        34,1E+14,0,Article,News,A Senator Plans Legislation to Narrow Authoritiesâ€™ Cellphone Data Requests,Technology,892,6.088,5.472,SAN FRANCISCO Â€Â” Cellphone carriers last year answered at least 1.1 million requests from law enforcement agencies seeking information on caller locations text messages and other data for use in investigations according to reports from the carriers.         Most of the requests were for information from a specific customer account. But law enforcement agencies also received information from 9000 so-called tower dumps in which the agencies were granted access to data from all the phones that connected to a cell site during a specified period of time.         The cellphone carriersÂ€Â™ reports which came in response to a congressional inquiry underscored the law enforcement agenciesÂ€Â™ strong reliance on wireless phone records. The carriers are shown to turn over records thousands of times a day in response to police emergencies subpoenas and other requests.         Senator Edward J. Markey a Massachusetts Democrat requested the reports from seven carriers including AT&T Verizon Wireless Sprint and T-Mobile US. Mr. Markey conducted a  In 2011 the carriers complied with 1.3 million requests from law enforcement agencies. That number is not directly comparable with 2012Â€Â™s total of 1.1 million requests because Sprint the third-largest American carrier did not answer all of Senator MarkeyÂ€Â™s questions.         Senator Markey said he planned to introduce legislation in the coming weeks that would provide stronger privacy protections for consumers including the requirement of a warrant for police to get cellphone location information from a carrier as proof that it would help uncover evidence of a crime.         Â€ÂœCongress needs to ensure that our laws keep up with technology including how law enforcement handles and disposes of this sensitive mobile phone informationÂ€Âù Senator Markey said in a phone interview.         The wide-ranging nature of government surveillance programs many of which have been revealed by documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden has nudged some lawmakers to reassess the nationÂ€Â™s privacy protections. Last week it was reported that the N.S.A. tracks the location and movements of hundreds of millions of  Technology companies like Apple and Google have recently started publishing so-called transparency reports on the government and law enforcement requests that they receive but the carriers have not released similar reports. The carriersÂ€Â™ responses to Senator Markey about law enforcement requests are the closest thing yet to a transparency report.         The carriers sometimes resist requests from law enforcement according to the reports. Reasons for rejection include when a request does not fully comply with the law Â€Â” for example when a signed court order is required instead of a subpoena. Verizon said in many instances law enforcement sought information that the carrier did not have.         But the carriersÂ€Â™ responses to Senator MarkeyÂ€Â™s inquiries also suggest that data-sharing policies are inconsistent among carriers. Some carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile US require a warrant for law enforcement to gain access to a personÂ€Â™s current location data. But Verizon Wireless and Cricket say they cannot provide real-time location information at all.         The carriers also retain the location data collected from cell sites for varying periods of time. While most of the companies retain records for six to 18 months AT&T holds them for five years.         Some types of content like text messages or voice mail messages that are older than 180 days are provided to law enforcement by AT&T with a subpoena but not a warrant.         The carriers were also shown to comply with tower dumps at 9000 cell sites a small percentage of the 302000 cell sites that were operational last year. But Christopher Calabrese legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union who reviewed the carriersÂ€Â™ responses said the number of tower dumps was significant.         Â€ÂœCell towers are handling hundreds of thousands of calls at any given time getting personal info on hundreds of thousands of people for extended periods of time in order for police to gather information on one personÂ€Âù Mr. Calabrese said.         Â€ÂœWhat I was really struck by in looking at this stuff is the very powerful informants our cellphones makeÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœThey know so much about us and they can share so much about us Â€Â” our texts where weÂ€Â™re going online our physical movements. ItÂ€Â™s a host of information that clearly law enforcement is very aware of and actively accessing.Â€Âù         The carriers devote a significant amount of resources to dealing with requests from law enforcement. For example AT&T said in its response that it had a staff of 100 full-time employees working seven days a week handling responses. It received $10.3 million in reimbursement for law enforcement responses last year.         Senator Markey said the legislation he planned to propose would require the Federal Communications Commission to limit the amount of time carriers could hold on to customersÂ€Â™ personal information. The senator said he also hoped to create a method to narrow down the information that police collected from a cell tower when doing so-called dumps.         Another piece of the legislation would require law enforcement officials to submit a signed and sworn statement whenever they received information from carriers in the case of emergency circumstances to increase accountability for the requests. Senator Markey said he also wanted law enforcement to write routine reports disclosing the nature and volume of their requests.        21,1E+14,1,Article,Op-Ed,Is It O.K. to Kill Cyclists?,Opinion,666,5.537,5.429,SAN FRANCISCO Â€Â” EVERYBODY who knows me knows that I love cycling and that IÂ€Â™m also completely freaked out by it. I got into the sport for middle-aged reasons: fat; creaky knees; the delusional vanity of tight shorts. Registering for a triathlon I took my first ride in decades. Wind in my hair smile on my face I decided instantly that I would bike everywhere like all those beautiful hipster kids on fixies. Within minutes however I watched an S.U.V. hit another cyclist and then I got my own front wheel stuck in a streetcar track sending me to the pavement.         I made it home alive and bought a stationary bike trainer and workout DVDs with the ex-pro Robbie Ventura guiding virtual rides on Wisconsin farm roads so that I could sweat safely in my California basement. Then I called my buddy Russ one of 13500 daily bike commuters in Washington D.C. Russ swore cycling was harmless but confessed to awakening recently in a Level 4 trauma center having been hit by a car he could not remember. Still Russ insisted I could avoid harm by assuming that every driver was Â€Âœa mouth-breathing drug addict with a murderous hatred for cyclists.Â€Âù         The anecdotes mounted: my wifeÂ€Â™s childhood friend was cycling with Mom and Dad when a city truck killed her; two of my fatherÂ€Â™s law partners maimed. I began noticing Â€Âœcyclist killedÂ€Âù news articles like one about Amelie Le Moullac 24 pedaling inside a bike lane in San FranciscoÂ€Â™s SOMA district when a truck turned right and killed her. In these articles I found a recurring phrase: to quote from The San Francisco Chronicle story about Ms. Le Moullac Â€ÂœThe truck driver stayed at the scene and was not cited.Â€Âù         In stories where the driver had been cited the penaltyÂ€Â™s meagerness defied belief like the teenager in 2011 who drove into the 49-year-old cyclist John Przychodzen from behind on a road just outside Seattle running over and killing him. The police issued only a $42 ticket for an Â€Âœunsafe lane changeÂ€Âù because the kid hadnÂ€Â™t been drunk and as they saw it had not been driving recklessly.         You donÂ€Â™t have to be a lefty pinko cycling activist to find something weird about that. But try a Google search for Â€Âœcyclist + accidentÂ€Âù and you will find countless similar stories: on Nov. 2 for example on the two-lane coastal highway near Santa Cruz Calif. a northbound driver lost control and veered clear across southbound traffic killing Joshua Alper a 40-year-old librarian cycling in the southbound bike lane. As usual: no charges no citation. Most online comments fall into two camps: cyclists outraged at inattentive drivers and wondering why cops donÂ€Â™t care; drivers furious at cyclists for clogging roads and flouting traffic laws.         My own view is that everybodyÂ€Â™s a little right and that weÂ€Â™re at a scary cultural crossroads on the whole car/bike thing. American cities are dense enough Â€Â” and almost half of urban car trips short enough under three miles Â€Â” that cities from Denver to Miami are putting in bike-share programs. If thereÂ€Â™s one thing New York CityÂ€Â™s incoming and departing mayors agree on itÂ€Â™s the need for more bike lanes.         The American Medical Association endorses National Bike to Work Day and more than 850000 people commute on a bicycle according to the  But the social and legal culture of the American road not to mention the road itself hasnÂ€Â™t caught up. Laws in most states do give bicycles full access to the road but very few roads are designed to accommodate bicycles and the speed and mass differentials Â€Â” bikes sometimes slow traffic only cyclists have much to fear from a crash Â€Â” make sharing the road difficult to absorb at an emotional level. Nor does it help that many cyclists do ignore traffic laws. Every time I drive my car through San Francisco I see cyclists running stop signs like immortal entitled fools. So I understand the impulse to see cyclists as recreational risk takers who deserve their fate.        52,1E+14,0,Article,News,"San Francisco Demonstrates That It Has a Home-Field Advantage, Too",Sports,883,5.429,5.634,SAN FRANCISCO Â€Â” For most of four quarters it looked as if San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick and running back Frank Gore would be outplayed again by their counterparts on the rival  But then Gore broke away for a 51-yard scamper late in the fourth quarter and Kaepernick bulled his way to another clock-eating first down leading the 49ers to a winning field goal and a 19-17 victory over the Seahawks.         By winning for the third time in a row the 49ers (9-4) kept themselves on the inside of the wild-card playoff pursuit and kept alive their dim hopes for a division title. The Seahawks (11-2) would have clinched the division and home-field advantage through the playoffs with a victory but still lead San Francisco by two games with three regular-season games remaining.         Â€ÂœWeÂ€Â™re getting hot at the right timeÂ€Âù said San Francisco receiver Anquan Boldin who had a team-high six receptions for 93 yards. Â€ÂœThatÂ€Â™s what you want.Â€Âù         Phil DawsonÂ€Â™s fourth field goal of the game from 22 yards with 26 seconds remaining gave the 49ers a 14-0-1 record against division opponents at Candlestick Park since 2009. But if these teams meet again this season it most likely will be in January in Seattle where the Seahawks are unbeaten the last two seasons.         The previous two games between the teams Â€Â” one in September one last December Â€Â” were lopsided affairs the Seahawks winning twice in Seattle by a combined 71-16.         Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m sure itÂ€Â™s possible that weÂ€Â™ll see each other againÂ€Âù  The growing West Coast rivalry with implications rippling across the conference centers largely on the two teamsÂ€Â™ young strong-armed and quick-footed quarterbacks each in his second season as a starter. Kaepernick completed 15 of 29 passes for 175 yards with an interception and a touchdown: an 8-yard pass to Davis with six seconds left in the half. Of San FranciscoÂ€Â™s five scoring drives it was the only one that ended with more than a field goal.         Â€ÂœIf we get 3 instead of 7 there we lose the gameÂ€Âù Kaepernick said.         SeattleÂ€Â™s Russell Wilson was 15 of 25 for 199 yards and a touchdown a 39-yard pass to tight end Luke Willson in the second quarter that gave Seattle a 14-9 lead. WilsonÂ€Â™s final throw of the game a desperate heave of more than 60 yards to try to set up a potential winning field goal was intercepted igniting a celebration in what was very likely the second-to-last 49ers game at Candlestick Park. The franchise plans to move next season to a stadium being built in Santa Clara 40 miles south.         A reporter asked San Francisco Coach Jim Harbaugh how much he enjoyed games with the Seahawks.         Â€ÂœEnjoy it?Â€Âù Harbaugh said. Â€ÂœThatÂ€Â™s not the word I would use. It feels like you go to the dentist chair and three and a half hours of getting root canal work done.Â€Âù         For all the focus on Kaepernick and Wilson and Gore and Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch (20 carries 72 yards) and each teamÂ€Â™s deep corps of receivers the Seahawks and the 49ers are rooted in championship-caliber defense. Seattle arrived with the N.F.L.Â€Â™s top-ranked defense by yards allowed (284.5 yards per game) and second in points allowed (15.5). The 49ers ranked fifth in yards (311.7) and third in points (16.4).         The lead changed four times in the first half and the 49ersÂ€Â™ 16-14 midpoint lead held until the fourth quarter as the teams settled into a back-and-forth struggle like two lumberjacks working a giant saw waiting for a breakthrough.         The 49ers squandered one third-quarter chance when Kaepernick lobbed a pass toward receiver Michael Crabtree that was intercepted by SeattleÂ€Â™s Byron Maxwell at the 1-yard line.         Seattle had a prime chance of its own when Golden Tate returned a punt to the San Francisco 27 with less than 10 minutes left. But the Seahawks settled for Steven HauschkaÂ€Â™s 31-yard field goal and a 17-16 lead with 6:20 remaining.         That left room for GoreÂ€Â™s 51-yard romp with just more than four minutes left to become the gameÂ€Â™s biggest play. On a first down he burst through the line of scrimmage on the left side then cut right racing diagonally away from his pursuers before stumbling down at the 18 as he tried to stay in bounds to keep the clock moving. Gore finished with 110 yards on 17 carries.         Kaepernick converted a third down with a tough 8-yard rush when he needed 7. The 49ers milked the clock and settled for DawsonÂ€Â™s winning points.         The result should temporarily alleviate the collective anxiety about the state of the 49ers this year after last seasonÂ€Â™s trip to the Super Bowl and the previous yearÂ€Â™s run to the conference championship game. Their struggles this season began with a second-week 29-3 loss in Seattle followed by a 27-7 home defeat to the Indianapolis Colts. The 49ers have won seven of nine since then their only stumbles to New Orleans and Carolina.         It may not be enough to get them back atop the division. But it very well may lead the 49ers back to Seattle.        181,1E+14,0,Article,News,Dawson Go-Ahead Field Goal Lifts 49ers by Seattle,Sports,817,5.29,5.438,"SAN FRANCISCO Â€Â” Frank Gore saw a huge hole with the clock ticking down and his team trailing and went for it with everything he had.         Maybe not a season-saving 51-yard burst but darn close to it.         The San Francisco 49ers are far from ready to hand over their two-year division reign Â€Â” and certainly not on their home field where they rarely lose against the NFC West.         Phil Dawson kicked a 22-yard field goal with 26 seconds remaining and the Niners held off the Seahawks 19-17 on Sunday denying Seattle a chance to clinch the division at Candlestick Park.         ""We're playing for our lives"" wideout Anquan Boldin said. ""We're playing playoff football right now. It's win or go home.""         Gore broke for his big gain with just more than four minutes left sparking the key 11-play 76-yard drive that helped the 49ers (9-4) stop the playoff-bound Seahawks (11-2) from grabbing away the West in San Francisco.         Dawson's fourth field goal gave him 20 successful attempts in a row a franchise record topping Joe Nedney's 18 consecutive kicks in 2006-07.         Russell Wilson threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to Luke Willson and Marshawn Lynch ran for an 11-yard score for Seattle denied a franchise-best sixth road victory in its fifth straight loss at The 'Stick.         ""I don't know if it was their  The 49ers are unbeaten at home against the West since losing to the Seahawks on Oct. 26 2008.         In an emotionally fueled afternoon of missed chances and costly penalties this rivalry game more than lived up to the hype.         ""Enjoy it? Not the word I would use. It's like going to the dentist chair for 3Ã‚Â_ hours and getting a root canal"" 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh said. ""These games are only for the tough.""         Eric Wright who briefly left the game with a head injury intercepted a last-ditch deep pass by Wilson with 9 seconds left to seal it.         The two young quarterbacks finished with nearly the same stats. Wilson went 15 of 25 for 199 yards and a touchdown with one interception while counterpart Colin Kaepernick threw for 175 yards and completed 15 of his 29 passes with a TD and an interception.         Vernon Davis caught an 8-yard touchdown pass just before halftime to give San Francisco some momentum.         After a home rout of New Orleans on Monday night the Seahawks were trying to make it two mammoth wins over NFC powers in seven days. They hurt themselves several times down the stretch.         Golden Tate helped put the Seahawks ahead midway through the fourth quarter with a 38-yard punt return. Wilson then hit Jermaine Kearse for a 14-yard gain and first down from the 24. But on third down from the 13 Wilson was forced to throw out of bounds under pressure.         Seattle settled for Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal that stayed just inside the left upright with 6:20 remaining.         While Lynch went over 1000 yards rushing for the third straight season and fifth in his seven-year career he slowed down in the second half. He wound up with 72 yards on 20 carries Â€Â” just 22 yards in the second half Â€Â” as the 49ers defense kept intact its streak of not allowing a 100-yard rusher this season.         ""It's December and we're playing our best football"" linebacker NaVorro Bowman said. ""There's something about this game that required a full 60 minutes of football.""         Kaepernick recovered from an interception late in the third quarter with the 49ers deep in Seattle territory. Momentarily helped by Donte Whitner's 15-yard taunting penalty against Lynch it came right back three plays later on Michael Robinson's facemask flag and Seattle punted.         With LaMichael James catching the punt O'Brien Schofield bumped James and received a 15-yard fair catch interference penalty. That started San Francisco's drive at the 48 but the 49ers went three and out.         The Seahawks had won seven in a row since an Oct. 6 loss at Indianapolis. They also had taken their last two meetings with the 49ers both at home by outscoring San Francisco 71-16 Â€Â” 29-3 in Week 2.         Boldin had six catches for 93 yards for his fourth straight game with at least five receptions.         Now the Niners realize they probably will have to make another trip to the Pacific Northwest and get by the Seahawks to return to the Super Bowl.

Â€ÂœBut I donÂ€Â™t think IÂ€Â™d ever be that coldblooded about this.Â€Âù         While the technology boom has bred hostility it has also brought San Francisco undeniable benefits. Mayor Edwin M. Lee credits the technology sector with helping to pull the city out of the recession creating jobs and nourishing a thriving economy that is the envy of cash-starved cities across the country.         The industry is Â€Âœnot so much taking over but complementing the job creation we want in the cityÂ€Âù Mr. Lee said while giving a tour of middle Market Street to show off its Â€ÂœrenaissanceÂ€Âù from a seedy skid row to a tech district where Twitter Square and other companies have made their home.         Yet city officials must grapple with the arithmetic of squeezing more people into the limited space afforded by San FranciscoÂ€Â™s 49 square miles. And it is the housing shortage that underlies much of the sniping about tech workers.         San Francisco has the least affordable housing in the nation with just 14 percent of homes accessible to middle-class buyers said Jed Kolko chief economist at the real estate website  Â€ÂœAffordable housing projects are constructed and the money set aside for that purpose is used but the demand is just far greater than what can be suppliedÂ€Âù said Fred Brousseau of the city budget and legislative analystÂ€Â™s office.

May Have Hit Internet Companies at a Weak Spot,Technology,556,6.088,5.586,SAN FRANCISCO Â€Â” The recent revelation that the National Security Agency was able to eavesdrop on the communications of Google and Yahoo users without breaking into either companyÂ€Â™s data centers sounded like something pulled from a Robert Ludlum spy thriller.         How on earth the companies asked did the N.S.A. get their data without their knowing about it?         The most likely answer is a modern spin on a century-old eavesdropping tradition.         People knowledgeable about Google and YahooÂ€Â™s infrastructure say they believe that government spies bypassed the big Internet companies and hit them at a weak spot Â€Â” the fiber-optic cables that connect data centers around the world and are owned by companies like Verizon Communications the BT Group the Vodafone Group and Level 3 Communications. In particular fingers have been pointed at Level 3 the worldÂ€Â™s largest so-called Internet backbone provider whose cables are used by Google and Yahoo.         The Internet companiesÂ€Â™ data centers are locked down with full-time security and state-of-the-art surveillance including heat sensors and iris scanners. But between the data centers Â€Â” on Level 3Â€Â™s fiber-optic cables that connected those massive computer farms Â€Â” information was unencrypted and an easier target for government intercept efforts according to three people with knowledge of GoogleÂ€Â™s and YahooÂ€Â™s systems who spoke on the condition of anonymity.         It is impossible to say for certain how the N.S.A. managed to get Google and YahooÂ€Â™s data without the companiesÂ€Â™ knowledge. But both companies in response to concerns over those vulnerabilities recently said they were now encrypting data that runs on the cables between their data centers. Microsoft is considering a similar move.         Â€ÂœEveryone was so focused on the N.S.A. secretly getting access to the front door that there was an assumption they werenÂ€Â™t going behind the companiesÂ€Â™ backs and tapping data through the back door tooÂ€Âù said Kevin Werbach an associate professor at the Wharton School.         Data transmission lines have a long history of being tapped.         As far back as the days of the telegraph spy agencies have located their operations in proximity to communications companies. Indeed before the advent of the Internet the N.S.A. and its predecessors for decades operated listening posts next to the long-distance lines of phone companies to monitor all international voice traffic.         Beginning in the 1960s a spy operation In the 1990s the emergence of the Internet both complicated the task of the intelligence agencies and presented powerful new spying opportunities based on the ability to process vast amounts of computer data.         In 2002 John M.

Although the Internet is designed to be a highly decentralized system in practice a small group of backbone providers carry almost all of the networkÂ€Â™s data.         The consequences of the centralization and its value for surveillance was revealed in 2006 by Mark Klein an AT&T technician who described an N.S.A. listening post inside a room at an AT&T switching facility.         The agency was capturing a copy of all the data passing over the telecommunications links and then filtering it in AT&T facilities that housed systems that were able to filter data packets at high speed.

Deepika Singh 26 had gashed her knee at a backyard barbecue. Orla Roche a rambunctious toddler on vacation with her family had tumbled from a couch splitting open her forehead on a table.         On a quiet Saturday in May nurses in blue scrubs quickly ushered the two patients into treatment rooms. The wounds were cleaned numbed and mended in under an hour. Â€ÂœIt was great Â€Â” they had good DVDs the staff couldnÂ€Â™t have been nicerÂ€Âù said Emer Duffy OrlaÂ€Â™s mother.         Then the bills arrived. Ms. SinghÂ€Â™s three stitches cost $2229.11. OrlaÂ€Â™s forehead was sealed with a dab of skin glue for $1696. Â€ÂœWhen I first saw the charge I said Â€Â˜What could possibly have cost that much?Â€Â™Ã‚Â Â€Âù recalled Ms. Singh. Â€ÂœThey billed for everything every pill.Â€Âù         In a medical system notorious for opaque finances and inflated bills nothing is more convoluted than hospital pricing economists say. Hospital charges represent about a third of the $2.7 trillion annual United States health care bill the biggest single segment  A day spent as an inpatient at an American hospital costs on average more than $4000 five times the charge in many other developed countries according to the  At Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City Daniel Diaz 29 a public relations executive was billed $3355.96 for five stitches on his finger after cutting himself while peeling an avocado. At a hospital in Jacksonville Fla. Arch Roberts Jr. 56 a former government employee was charged more than $2000 for three stitches after being bitten by a dog. At Mercy Hospital in Port Huron Mich. Chelsea Manning 22 a student received bills for close to $3000 for six stitches after she tripped running up a path. Insurers and patients negotiated lower prices but those charges were a starting point.         The main reason for high hospital costs in the United States economists say is fiscal not medical: Hospitals are the most powerful players in a health care system that has little or no price regulation in the private market.         Rising costs of drugs medical equipment and other services and fees from layers of middlemen play a significant role in escalating hospital bills of course. But just as important is that mergers and consolidation have resulted in a couple of hospital chains Â€Â” like Partners in Boston or Banner in Phoenix Â€Â” dominating many parts of the country allowing them to command high prices from insurers and employers.         Sutter Health California Pacific Medical CenterÂ€Â™s parent company operates more than two dozen community hospitals in Northern California almost all in middle-class or high-income neighborhoods. Its clout has helped California Pacific Medical Center the stateÂ€Â™s largest private nonprofit hospital also earn the highest net income in California. Prices for many of the procedures at the San Francisco hospital are among the top 20 percent in the country according to a New York Times analysis of data released by the federal government.         Â€ÂœSutter is a leader Â€Â” a pioneer Â€Â” in figuring out how to amass market power to raise prices and decrease competitionÂ€Âù said Glenn Melnick a professor of health economics at the University of Southern California. Â€ÂœHow do hospitals set prices? They set prices to maximize revenue and they raise prices as much as they can Â€Â” all the research supports that.Â€Âù         In other countries the price of a day in the hospital often includes many basic services. Not here. The Â€ÂœchargemasterÂ€Âù the price list created by each hospital typically has more than ten thousand entries and almost nothing Â€Â” even an aspirin a bag of IV fluid or a visit from a physical therapist to help a patient get out of bed Â€Â” is free. Those lists are usually secret but California requires them to be  California Pacific Medical CenterÂ€Â™s 400-page chargemaster for this year contains some eye-popping figures: from $32901 for an  Dr. Warren Browner the chief executive officer of California Pacific Medical Center said that there were good reasons that hospitals charged what they did: They must have highly trained professionals available 24 hours a day seven days a week. They must constantly upgrade to the latest equipment and building standards to meet patientsÂ€Â™ expectations and state mandates. They charge paying or well-insured patients more to compensate for others they treat at a loss.         Â€ÂœHospital care is extremely expensive to produce and to have available for everyone in the communityÂ€Âù he said noting that hospitals needed to have a neurosurgeon on call in case a patient turned up with a blood clot on the brain. Â€ÂœWe take every penny of the revenue we earn and use it to build new and better facilities for everyone in the city.Â€Âù         Some health economists say that even though most hospitals are nonprofit they nonetheless are often flush with revenue and guilty of unnecessary spending.         Â€ÂœHospitals are self-fueling ever-expanding machinesÂ€Âù said James Robinson an economist and professor of health policy at the University of California Berkeley. Â€ÂœThere is an infinite amount of stuff to buy Â€Â” amenities machines new wings higher salaries more nurses.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœButÂ€Âù he asked Â€Âœto deliver good health care what do you need?Â€Âù          There is little science to how hospitals determine the prices they print on hospital bills.         Â€ÂœChargemaster prices are basically arbitrary not connected to underlying costs or market pricesÂ€Âù said Professor Melnick the economist. Hospitals Â€Âœcan set them at any level they want. There are no market constraints.Â€Âù         Prices for any item or service are set by each hospital and move up and down yearly and show extraordinary variability health economists say. The codeine that costs $20 and the bag of IV fluid that costs $137 at California Pacific are charged at $1 and $16 at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center across town. But U.C.S.F. Medical Center charges $1600 for an amniocentesis which costs $687 at California Pacific.         After each hospital stay or visit computer programs and human coders and billers use the chargemaster price list to translate the services rendered into a price. Sutter employs more than 1300 people at a special center in Roseville Calif. to perform this and other administrative tasks for its hospitals. Emergency room visits typically include separate charges for doctorÂ€Â™s services and for supplies as well as a Â€Âœfacility feeÂ€Âù Â€Â” the charge for walking in the door.         Orla RocheÂ€Â™s bill for example included $529 for Â€Âœsupplies and devicesÂ€Âù though her mother is perplexed about what those are: Orla left the emergency room with gauze wrapped round her head (under $1 at Internet supply stores) festooned with a pink cartoon sticker. According to the chargemaster price list for California Pacific a vial of skin glue is billed at $181 a tube of  The bill also included $1167 for the facility fee which was classified at Level 3 Â€Â” the middle of the scale though OrlaÂ€Â™s treatment was one of the most simple emergency room interventions. At Lenox Hill in New York Daniel DiazÂ€Â™s unusually detailed bill for his stitches included $1828 for emergency room services $628 for repairing the wound $571.83 for Â€Âœapplication of a finger splintÂ€Âù $97.10 for a  Economists note that hospitals can bill for emergency room care with relative impunity since injured patients generally rush to the nearest treatment facility. But worried about high prices even the sick sometimes shop around. When Jamie Burke 33 a graduate student in North Carolina came to after she was knocked out during a soccer game in April she started searching on her smartphone for an in-network hospital as a friend drove.         Â€ÂœIt was crazyÂ€Âù she said Â€Âœbut luckily I wasnÂ€Â™t unconscious so I could figure it out.Â€Âù         She is glad she did: Though the hospital billed $5039 her insurerÂ€Â™s in-network contracted rate was about $2700. With copays and coinsurance she owed $600 for the visit.         The uninsured are particularly vulnerable to high prices since they have no one to argue on their behalf. When Arch Roberts Jr. got his bill of more than $2000 for stitches he explained that he was uninsured and his business had failed during the housing crisis so he could not afford the fee. The hospital offered him a Â€Âœcharity care discountÂ€Âù Â€Â” a price that was still out of range. Â€ÂœI donÂ€Â™t have $800 to pay them any more than I have $2000Â€Âù for three stitches he said noting that the hospital has been Â€ÂœrelentlessÂ€Âù in its collection efforts.          Once perennial money pits emergency rooms have become big moneymakers for most hospitals in the last decade experts say as they raised their fees and Â€ÂœmanagedÂ€Âù their patient mix. California Pacific Medical Center has nearly doubled its emergency room fees since 2005 its chargemaster price lists show.         California PacificÂ€Â™s emergency room is not a trauma center; poor or uninsured trauma patients who require lengthy inpatient stays can strain a hospital budget. And insurers allow emergency rooms to bill more than urgent-care centers for simple procedures like stitches or X-raying a sprained ankle making such procedures profitable. Indeed the financial prospects are so appealing that doctorsÂ€Â™ groups in Texas are opening free-standing Â€Âœemergency roomsÂ€Âù that are not connected to hospitals.         Â€ÂœHospitals see where theyÂ€Â™re making money and try to do more of thatÂ€Âù said Dr. David Gifford a former health commissioner of Rhode Island who has studied how labs price their tests. He said that laboratory tests and X-rays are priced high and are profitable though there is no difference in quality from national commercial labs that charge far less. A blood count and blood electrolyte test Â€Â” ordered every day for most inpatients and often in the emergency room Â€Â” are priced at $259.06 and $293.25 on California Pacific Medical CenterÂ€Â™s chargemaster price list. Insurers often pay outside labs less than $10 for the services.         And like any business many hospitals try to do fewer services that are not well paid. In 2012 over loud patient protests California Pacific Medical Center outsourced its kidney  Â€ÂœYou need a Ph.D. in health economicsÂ€Âù to understand medical pricing said Dr. Browner who has acknowledged that California PacificÂ€Â™s chargemaster prices might appear high. But he added Â€ÂœWe have to recoup what it costs to keep open what it costs to take care of the un- and underinsured and to rebuild.Â€Âù         He said that MediCal CaliforniaÂ€Â™s  Dr. Browner also pointed to what health care executives call the Â€ÂœSaudi sheikh problemÂ€Âù at some hospitals.         Â€ÂœYou donÂ€Â™t really want to change your charges if you have a Saudi sheikh come in with a suitcase full of cash whoÂ€Â™s going to pay full chargesÂ€Âù he said.         But how much actual charity care does a hospital like California Pacific Medical Center perform? And are insurers and patients paying hospitals for better quality? Or also for amenities like valet parking useless medical gadgetry and inflated salaries?         Though hospitalsÂ€Â™ nonprofit status allows them to reap tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in tax benefits California Pacific Medical CenterÂ€Â™s main campuses spent 1.27 percent of their more than $1.1 billion in net patient revenues in 2011 on free care for indigent or uninsured patients lower than the state average of 2.07 percent according to  Sutter based in Sacramento  California Pacific SutterÂ€Â™s main campus is in upscale Pacific Heights. It has just broken ground on a $2.7 billion renovation which includes a new flagship hospital. Though the project was initiated to meet new state earthquake standards the facility is designed as a sleek glass and marble structure with all private rooms underground parking and roof gardens with flowers and bees Â€Âœto enhance the quality of the healing environmentÂ€Âù according to California Pacific Medical CenterÂ€Â™s website. Its Facebook page has called it Â€Âœthe coolest hospital in San Francisco possibly the country and even the world.Â€Âù         Consumers may appreciate Â€Â” or demand Â€Â” features that contribute to bigger hospital bills. But studies have found no correlation between prices and patient outcomes. A California state rating of hospital services by  Its crosstown neighbor University of California San Francisco a nationally ranked academic institution charges far less per day than California Pacific when the greater severity of illnesses of its patients is factored in Professor Melnick said. In factÃ‚Â a recent study in the publication Annals of Surgery a monthly review of surgical science found that hospitals with the highest complication rates tended to have higher prices.         From such variations economists conclude that Â€ÂœcostsÂ€Âù are highly discretionary noting that hospitals in other developed countries often provide high-quality care with better outcomes in comparatively no-frills environments. Said Dr. Robinson the Berkeley health economist: Â€ÂœIf you pay hospitals more they spend it. If you pay them less they adjust. The only way to pay less for health care Â€Â” is to pay less for health care.Â€Âù         Hospital officials like to say that their list prices do not reflect what most patients actually pay because private and government insurers negotiate discounts. Simone Singh a professor of health management and policy at the University of Michigan estimated that insurers generally paid 40 to 50 percent of charges. But with powerful chains like Sutter prices are high and the discounts often are not so generous. Patients are left paying more.          For her three stitches at California Pacific Medical Center Deepika Singh ended up paying $768.56 Â€Â” a lot of money for a 26-year-old retail supply chain manager Â€Â” of the $1813 rate her insurer negotiated for the approximately $2200 bill. Ms. Duffy owed $1366 after her insurerÂ€Â™s discount on 2-year-old OrlaÂ€Â™s $1700 bill since the family had not met its annual deductible. Â€ÂœHow much is that per minute?Â€Âù she asked.         Across California Sutter hospitals have proved expert at the business of medicine. Â€ÂœOur members are very exercised about Sutter Â€Â” it has increased prices disproportionatelyÂ€Âù said David Lansky chief executive officer of the Pacific Business Group on Health which represents 60 of CaliforniaÂ€Â™s biggest private employers in its health care negotiations. Â€ÂœSutter has been successful at leveraging their huge size in dictating not just price but contract terms.Â€Âù         Its major competitor is Kaiser a health maintenance organization that runs a closed network of hospitals and doctors. California Pacific Medical Center delivers more than half the babies in San Francisco and is the cityÂ€Â™s largest employer after Wells Fargo. Sutter contracts also include Â€Âœgag clausesÂ€Âù that prevent employers from knowing what rates have been negotiated by their insurers on their behalf Mr. Lansky said.         Chuck Idelson a spokesman for the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy the research arm of the California Nurses Association said Sutter prices were 40 to 70 percent above its rivalsÂ€Â™ for similar services. When Sutter bought Summit Hospital in Oakland in 1999 rates there went up  Terry Miller 62 a businessman in the Bay Area got a bill for $117000 for a two-night stay at California Pacific Medical Center to place a  The high prices have had a ripple effect across Northern California allowing smaller hospitals to charge more as well. Â€ÂœSutter is the tallest Sequoia and everyone goes up just underneath them a bitÂ€Âù said Professor Melnick. He noted that hospital prices in California had more than doubled in the past decade after adjustment for inflation.         And payouts in the Pacific region for simple emergency room treatments Â€Â” stitches a sprained ankle and an   In theory health care consolidation can lead to economies of scale but not if it produces complex supersize systems. Excess administrative costs accounted for about $190 billion of the $2.5 trillion medical bill of the United States in 2009 the Institute of Medicine estimated this year Â€Â” money that could be used for other purposes.         Â€ÂœThere is a big flurry of consolidation and the effects depend on what the objective of the health care system isÂ€Âù said Orry Jacobs of the health care consulting firm BDC Advisors. Â€ÂœIf the intent is to improve care and bend cost curves then networks can do so. If the objective is to corner the market and demand higher rates then that will happen.Â€Âù Indeed research shows that todayÂ€Â™s hospital mergers tend to drive up prices.         And employers have limited ability to fight back. Sutter operates the only hospital in some California cities. Beginning on Jan. 1 the University of California Berkeley will exclude SutterÂ€Â™s two nearby hospitals from its plan because it could not reach a price agreement. The universityÂ€Â™s employees will have to cross the bay or drive inland for in-network hospital treatment or pay more.         As is often the case in American medicine patients will decide if they are willing to pay the high price of care. Back home in New York City Orla DuffyÂ€Â™s head wound has healed nicely without further treatment. Deepika Singh had her stitches taken out at an urgent care clinic costing $25 with her copay during a business trip to Washington.         Daniel Diaz who had been treated at Lenox Hill Mr. Roberts and Amy Bernstein had no choice but to visit an emergency room this year for stitches. But they all refused to see a doctor for the follow-up.

But instead of neatly clarifying human evolution the finding is adding new mysteries.         In a paper in the journal Nature scientists  The fossil a thigh bone found in Spain had previously seemed to many experts to belong to a forerunner of Neanderthals. But its DNA tells a very different story. It most closely resembles DNA from an enigmatic lineage of humans known as Denisovans. Until now Denisovans were known only from DNA retrieved from 80000-year-old remains in Siberia 4000 miles east of where the new DNA was found.         The mismatch between the anatomical and genetic evidence surprised the scientists who are now rethinking human evolution over the past few hundred thousand years. It is possible for example that there are many extinct human populations that scientists have yet to discover. They might have interbred swapping DNA. Scientists hope that further studies of extremely ancient human DNA will clarify the mystery.         Â€ÂœRight now weÂ€Â™ve basically generated a big question markÂ€Âù said Matthias Meyer a geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig Germany and a co-author of the new study.         Hints at new hidden complexities in the human story came from a 400000-year-old femur found in a cave in Spain called Sima de los Huesos (Â€Âœthe pit of bonesÂ€Âù in Spanish). The scientific team used new methods to extract the ancient DNA from the fossil.         Â€ÂœThis would not have been possible even a year agoÂ€Âù said Juan Luis Arsuaga a paleoanthropologist at Universidad Complutense de Madrid and a co-author of the paper.         Finding such ancient human DNA was a major advance said David Reich a geneticist at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the research. Â€ÂœThatÂ€Â™s an amazing game-changing thingÂ€Âù he said.         Since the 1970s Spanish scientists have brought out a wealth of fossils from the cave dating back hundreds of thousands of years. Â€ÂœThe place is very specialÂ€Âù said Dr. Arsuaga who has found 28 nearly complete skeletons of humans during three decades of excavations.         Based on the anatomy of the fossils Dr. Arsuaga has argued that they belonged to ancestors of Neanderthals which lived in western Asia and Europe from about 200000 to 30000 years ago.         When Dr. Meyer and his colleagues drilled into the femur they found ancient human DNA inside just as they had hoped.         Â€ÂœOur expectation was that it would be a very early NeanderthalÂ€Âù Dr. Meyer said.         But the DNA did not match that of Neanderthals. Dr. Meyer then compared it to the DNA of the Denisovans the ancient human lineage that he and his colleagues had discovered in Siberia in 2010. He was shocked to find that it was similar.         Â€ÂœEverybody had a hard time believing it at firstÂ€Âù Dr. Meyer said. Â€ÂœSo we generated more and more data to nail it down.Â€Âù         The extra research confirmed that the DNA belonged on the Denisovan branch of the human family tree.         The new finding is hard to reconcile with the picture of human evolution that has been emerging based on fossils and ancient DNA. Denisovans were believed to be limited to East Asia and they were not thought to look so Neanderthal-like.         Based on previously discovered ancient DNA and fossil evidence scientists generally agreed that humansÂ€Â™ direct ancestors shared a common ancestor with Neanderthals and Denisovans that lived about half a million years ago in Africa.         Their shared ancestors split off from humansÂ€Â™ lineage and left Africa then split further into the Denisovans and Neanderthals about 300000 years ago. The evidence suggested that Neanderthals headed west toward Europe and that the Denisovans moved east.         HumansÂ€Â™ ancestors meanwhile stayed in Africa giving rise to Homo sapiens about 200000 years ago. Humans then expanded from Africa into Asia and Europe about 60000 years ago. They then interbred not only with Neanderthals but with Denisovans too. Later both the Denisovans and Neanderthals became extinct.         Â€ÂœNow we have to rethink the whole storyÂ€Âù Dr. Arsuaga said.         Dr. Arsuaga doubts that Denisovans were spread out across so much of the Old World from Spain to Siberia masquerading as Neanderthals.         One alternative explanation is that the humans of Sima de los Huesos were not true Neanderthals but belonged to the ancestors of both Denisovans and Neanderthals.         It is also possible that the newly discovered DNA was passed to both Neanderthals and Denisovans but eventually disappeared from Neanderthals replaced by other variants.         Â€ÂœIt got lost in one lineage but made its way in the otherÂ€Âù suggested Jean-Jacques Hublin a Max Planck paleoanthropologist who was not involved in the research.         Beth Shapiro an expert on ancient DNA at the University of California Santa Cruz favors an even more radical possibility: that the humans of Sima de los Huesos belong to yet another branch of humans. They might have been a species called Homo erectus which originated about 1.8 million years ago and became extinct within the last few hundred thousand years.         Â€ÂœThe more we learn from the DNA extracted from these fossils the more complicated the story becomesÂ€Âù Dr. Shapiro said.         This complicated story has come to light only because of advances over the past 20 years in retrieving ancient DNA.         When an organism dies its DNA breaks down into smaller and smaller fragments while also becoming contaminated with the DNA of other species like soil bacteria. So piecing the fossil DNA together is a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle created by a sadist.         In 1997 Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute and his colleagues who had pioneered the techniques for retrieving DNA fragments  In 2006 a team of French and Belgian researchers obtained a fragment of Neanderthal DNA dating back  Meanwhile using improved methods Dr. Paabo Dr. Meyer and their colleagues  That discovery shed light on how Neanderthals and humansÂ€Â™ ancestors split from a common ancestor hundreds of thousands of years ago. It also revealed that Neanderthals and humans interbred  Around the same time as that discovery Russian collaborators sent the Max Planck team 80000-year-old fossils they had found in a cave in Siberia called Denisova. When the German scientists sequenced the entire genome from the finger bone of a girl it turned out to be neither human nor Neanderthal but from a  Dr. Meyer is hopeful that he and his colleagues will be able to get more DNA from the Spanish fossil as well as other fossils from the site to help solve the puzzle they have now stumbled across. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s extremely hard to make sense ofÂ€Âù Dr. Meyer said. Â€ÂœWe still are a bit lost here.Â€Âù        38,1E+14,1,Article,News,"Quitting the N.F.L.: For John Moffitt, the Money Wasnâ€™t Worth It",Sports,635,5.359,5.671,SEATTLE Â€Â” John Moffitt chugged mugs of black coffee and talked almost giddily about how the week before he called John Elway the head of football operations for the  In parts of three seasons as a guard with the  Â€ÂœI donÂ€Â™t want to risk health for moneyÂ€Âù said Moffitt who walked away from about $1 million in salary various benefits for retirees who play at least three seasons and quite possibly a trip to the Super Bowl with the 9-1 Broncos. Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m happy and I donÂ€Â™t need the N.F.L.Â€Âù         Most weeks the departure of a player like Moffitt who played sporadically and often anonymously on the offensive line would have warranted barely a footnote among fans and general managers and his spot on the roster would have been quickly filled by an eager replacement.         But Moffitt quit the same week that the N.F.L. was consumed by allegations of bullying on the Miami Dolphins and disturbing reports that the former Dallas Cowboys running back Tony Dorsett and other retired stars might have early onset degenerative brain disease.         The heightened awareness of footballÂ€Â™s physical tolls has prompted hundreds of former players to express regret over what the sport did to their bodies.Ã‚Â Yet Moffitt is unique for openly discussing his injuries and the brutal reality of playing in the N.F.L.Ã‚Â          Â€ÂœThey are merchandising human beings letÂ€Â™s be honestÂ€Âù said MoffittÃ‚Â who at a cafe in Pike Place Market in Seattle reveled in his freedom much like the Tim Robbins character in Â€ÂœThe Shawshank RedemptionÂ€Âù who after breaking out of jail rips off his shirt in the rain and laughs at the sky.         In a far-reaching interview last week Moffitt described how his decision to leave the N.F.L. a level he worked so hard to reach was far from rash even though he announced it on Twitter and was accused online of being impulsive and naÃƒÂ¯ve.         Quitting he said had little to do with his diminished playing time though he suited up for only two games this season or any dissatisfaction with the Seahawks or Broncos organizations which he said treated him well.         Rather it was the culmination of months of reflection that his once-promising career had been derailed by injuries and that continuing to play for the money and to please others would very likely ruin his health further and deepen his gloom.         In the off-season after battling for playing time and trying to stay fit Moffitt a free spirit who idolizes Jim Morrison started reading the writings of the Dalai Lama and Noam Chomsky among others. They helped him conclude that he was a pawn in a machine that controlled his life and that he no longer wanted to meet the expectations attached to that life.         Â€ÂœYou kind of let go of that dream that you kill yourself for to be a millionaire and you see through it and see that itÂ€Â™s just a facadeÂ€Âù said Moffitt who was dressed in baggy jeans T-shirt work boots and black pea coat. Â€ÂœI let go of all that stuff.Â€Âù         Moffitt returned to training camp harboring doubts. In August the Seahawks traded him to Cleveland but the deal was reversed because the Browns said they had concerns about his health. Moffitt said the Browns voided the trade because he refused to take a pay cut something the team denied.         So the Seahawks traded Moffitt to the Broncos for whom he had an opportunity to protect Peyton Manning probably the N.F.L.Â€Â™s biggest star. To outsiders it was a dream job with a near-certain trip to the playoffs. But the trade only confirmed to Moffitt that he did not control his destiny.         Â€ÂœHis love of the game changed because itÂ€Â™s a business in the N.F.L.Â€Âù his father Dave Moffitt said. Â€ÂœThe minute he signed I told him: YouÂ€Â™re John Moffitt Inc.

After a global corporation posts record profits it asks the state that has long nurtured its growth for the nationÂ€Â™s biggest single tax break and then tells the people who make its products that their pension plan will be frozen their benefits slashed their pay raises meager. Take it or we leave. And everyone caves.         Well almost everyone. All went according to script as the Boeing Company showed what to expect in a grim future for a diminished class Â€Â” the vanishing American factory worker. The threats were issued the tax giveaways approved the political leaders warned of the need to buckle to Boeing.         This didnÂ€Â™t happen in a broken town with a broken industrial heart. It took place in one of the most prosperous metropolitan areas on the planet Â€Â” Seattle Â€Â” home to Starbucks Costco Microsoft Nordstrom and Amazon.com which is on its way to becoming the worldÂ€Â™s largest retailer.         But then came the final item a vote of the people who actually assemble the planes. By a 2-1 margin on Wednesday the machinists of Puget Sound told Boeing to stuff it. With this act of economic suicide the state could lose up to 56000 jobs on the new 777X plane. Cue your metaphor Â€Â” the Alamo CusterÂ€Â™s Last Stand Braveheart.         The events of the last few days show the utter bankruptcy of economic policy prescriptions offered by both political parties. You want tax breaks and deregulation Â€Â” the Republican mantra? The $8.7 billion granted Boeing this week is the largest single state-tax giveaway in the nationÂ€Â™s history. It wasnÂ€Â™t enough. You want government training for schools and highly skilled workers Â€Â” the Democratic alternative? There was plenty of that to BoeingÂ€Â™s liking in the package.         What Boeing wants is very simple: to pay the people who make its airplanes as little money as it can get away with. It needs to do this weÂ€Â™re told to stay competitive. It has all the leverage because enough states Â€Â” and countries Â€Â” are willing to give it everything it asks for. Who wouldnÂ€Â™t want a gleaming factory stuffed with jet assemblers a payroll guaranteed for a generation?         Boeing is on a roll its stock at a record high despite the troubled rollout of its 787 Dreamliner and the pay of its C.E.O. boosted 20 percent to a package totaling $27.5 million last year. It is not impelled as the auto industry was five years ago in the midst of bailouts and cutbacks. Boeing could afford to be generous or at least not onerous. But itÂ€Â™s easier to play state against state the race to the bottom.         What BoeingÂ€Â™s riveters line-assemblers and welders want is a thimble of respect. People have been building flying machines in this region since young Bill Boeing rolled seaplanes out of a barn nearly 100 years ago. The machinists didnÂ€Â™t ask for hefty pay raises or new benefits as a condition to keep the much-promoted 777X production in this region. They just wanted to preserve what they had Â€Â” jobs that could pay up upward of $80000 a year with a guaranteed pension.         Boeing's proposal would have cut workers' compensation but kept assembly of the 777X jet in Washington State. Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m tired of being slapped in the faceÂ€Âù said John Gilman who has worked at Boeing for nearly 40 years. Â€ÂœBuilding airplanes Â€Â” it takes years of training and skill. The people who run this company used to understand that. But now itÂ€Â™s run by bean counters and lawyers.Â€Âù         Gilman was among the thousands of factory workers voting on BoeingÂ€Â™s take-it-or-we-leave proposal Wednesday. The anger was palpable. The president of the local machinists union had called the proposal Â€Âœa piece of crap.Â€Âù Others referred to it as Â€Âœthe Walmartization of aerospace.Â€Âù As they voted vultures circled among them Gov. Rick Perry of Texas who tweeted last week that his low-tax low-wage state was ready to help Boeing.         One of the more tedious laments of our day is the bromide that we donÂ€Â™t make things anymore in the United States. In fact we make plenty of things including world-class airplanes. But the question is whether we can still pay the people who make them a decent wage.         Perhaps not. In the wake of the machinistsÂ€Â™ rebellion Boeing is likely to move. Â€ÂœWeÂ€Â™re left with no choice but to open the process competitively and pursue all options for the 777XÂ€Âù said BoeingÂ€Â™s commercial airplanes C.E.O. Ray Conner after the vote.         So off to Texas where one in four people have no health care or South Carolina where a compliant work force would never think of putting up a fight? And who can blame Boeing? After all pensions are a thing of the past arenÂ€Â™t they? Wages and household income across the country have not risen in nearly 15 years.         This is supposed to be the age of the gig economy Â€Â” every worker an entrepreneur. But it hasnÂ€Â™t translated to a fix of the greatest economic crisis of our times: how to preserve a declining middle class.         The distilled wisdom on this subject says that education Â€Â” elevating minds skills and critical thinking to match a tomorrow economy Â€Â” is the way forward. And everyone in this tomorrow-economy state seems to agree. Except look at what happened here a parable for troubled times. The state agreed to subsidize Boeing to the tune of $500 million a year over 16 years. ThatÂ€Â™s twice what the state gives to the University of Washington the regionÂ€Â™s flagship college long an elevator to the middle class. Maybe the university should threaten to leave town.        10,1E+14,1,Article,News,Wage Strikes Planned at Fast-Food Outlets,Business Day,399,5.838,5.612,Seeking to increase pressure on McDonaldÂ€Â™s WendyÂ€Â™s and other fast-food restaurants organizers of a movement demanding a $15-an-hour wage for fast-food workers say they will sponsor one-day strikes in 100 cities on Thursday and protest activities in 100 additional cities.         As the movement struggles to find pressure points in its quest for substantially higher wages for workers organizers said strikes were planned for the first time in cities like Charleston S.C.; Providence R.I.; and Pittsburgh.         The protests have expanded greatly since November 2012 when 200 fast-food workers engaged in a one-day strike at more than 20 restaurants in New York City the first such walkout in the history of the nationÂ€Â™s fast-food industry.         Â€ÂœThereÂ€Â™s been pretty huge growth in one yearÂ€Âù said Kendall Fells one of the movementÂ€Â™s main organizers. Â€ÂœPeople understand that a one-day strike is not going to get them there. They understand that this needs to continue to grow.Â€Âù         The movement which includes the groups  The fast-food effort is backed by the Service Employees International Union and is also demanding that restaurants allow workers to unionize without the threat of retaliation.         Officials with the National Restaurant Association have said the one-day strikes are publicity stunts. They warn that increasing pay to $15 an hour when the federal minimum wage is $7.25 would cause restaurants to rely more on automation and hire fewer workers.         Industry officials say that only a small percentage of fast-food jobs pay the minimum wage and that those are largely entry-level jobs for workers under 25.         Backers of the movement for higher pay point to studies saying that the average age of fast-food workers is 29 and that more than one-fourth are parents raising children.

South KoreaÂ€Â™s expanded Â€Âœair defense identification zoneÂ€Âù was the latest sign of a broadening discord among the Northeast Asian neighbors who are already locked in territorial and historical disputes.         With South KoreaÂ€Â™s newly expanded zone the air defense zones of all three countries now overlap over a submerged reef called Ieodo in South Korea and Suyan Rock in China. The reef is controlled by South Korea which maintains a maritime research station there but China also claims it. The seabed around the reef is believed to be rich in natural gas and minerals deposits.         The South Korean move came two weeks after China stoked regional tensions by unilaterally expanding its own air patrol zone to partly overlap with South KoreaÂ€Â™s and include airspace over the reef. The expanded Chinese air control zone also covers a set of East China Sea islands called Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese which are at the heart of a territorial feud between Japan and China.         The airspace disputes were a major topic when Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. visited Japan China and South Korea last week.         With its announcement on Sunday South Korea expanded its air defense zone more than 300 kilometers or 186 miles to the south. It said its new zone would take effect in a week. There was no immediate response from Beijing or Tokyo.         The expanded air defense zone follows the boundaries of South KoreaÂ€Â™s existing Â€Âœflight information regionÂ€Âù an area assigned to South Korea for civilian air traffic control under an agreement with the International Civil Aviation Organization. It will have no impact on civilian flights said Kim Min-seok a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry.         But the announcement of the expanded zone raises the risk of an accidental military clash in the region. A military plane entering another countryÂ€Â™s air defense identification zone must notify that country in advance. If it fails to do so the country operating the zone may order it to leave or dispatch military jets to confront the intruding aircraft.         Maj. Gen. Chang Hyok a senior policy coordinator at the South Korean Defense Ministry said Sunday that his government had explained its new air patrol zone to China and Japan. President Park Geun-hye also discussed it with Mr. Biden on Friday.         Â€ÂœOur top priority is to prevent accidental military clashes in the areaÂ€Âù General Chang said at a news briefing.         The State Department offered support for South KoreaÂ€Â™s approach saying that keeping open the lines of communication with China and Japan Â€Âœavoids confusion for or threats to civilian airlines.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœThe United States has been and will remain in close consultation with our allies and partners in the region to ensure their actions contribute to greater stability predictability and consistency with international practicesÂ€Âù said Jen Psaki a State Department spokeswoman.         When China declared its new air defense zone on Nov. 23 and demanded that planes flying in the area first notify Chinese authorities both Japan and South Korea immediately rejected it. Their military aircraft have since flown through the disputed airspace without informing China.         The United States has also flown two B-52 long-range bombers through the contested airspace a move seen as a warning by Washington that it would defy what it considered a provocative attempt by China to expand its control over airspace in the region.         South KoreaÂ€Â™s air defense zone was first established in March 1951 by the United States Pacific Air Forces command which wanted to guard against China which had just joined the Korean War.         Until China expanded its air defense zone the sky over the submerged reef of Ieodo was covered only by JapanÂ€Â™s air control zone. South Korea did not attempt to expand its air patrol zone over the reef partly for fear that such a move might prompt Japan to claim the airspace over a disputed set of islets off the eastern coast of South Korea.         The South Korean-controlled islets called Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan are the source of another long-running territorial disagreement between the nations.         Under Ms. Park South Korea has emphasized building what it calls a Â€Âœstrategic cooperative partnershipÂ€Âù with China by far its largest trading partner. It also recognizes the growing importance of BeijingÂ€Â™s role in international efforts to curb North KoreaÂ€Â™s nuclear weapons program. Ms. Park has met President Xi Jinping of China twice but the territorial and historical controversies rooted in JapanÂ€Â™s regional aggression in the early 20th century have kept her from meeting JapanÂ€Â™s prime minister Shinzo Abe.         ChinaÂ€Â™s attempt to police additional airspace over the East China Sea has highlighted a potentially volatile dispute between China and South Korea. The South Korean Navy is already building a $970 million base naval base in Jeju an island off the southern coast of South Korea to protect shipping lanes for South KoreaÂ€Â™s oil-dependent export-driven economy as well as to respond quickly to any dispute with China over the submerged reef.        44,1E+14,0,Article,News,North Korea Releases List of Accusations Against Purged Official,World,829,5.723,5.477,SEOUL South Korea Â€Â” North Korea confirmed on Monday that Jang Song-thaek the uncle of Kim Jong-un the countryÂ€Â™s top leader had been stripped of all titles of power and expelled from the ruling WorkersÂ€Â™ Party of Korea. Mr. Jang is the most prominent figure to be purged since Mr. Kim took power two years ago.         Moving swiftly to consolidate his authority Mr. Kim presided over an extended meeting of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee on Sunday which A number of Mr. JangÂ€Â™s associates also were purged according to a lengthy report by the state-run Korea Central News Agency which called them Â€Âœa modern-day factionÂ€Âù and Â€Âœundesirable elements who happened to worm their ways into our party ranks.Â€Âù Mr. Jang and his Â€ÂœgroupÂ€Âù were accused of committing Â€Âœsuch anti-party counterrevolutionary factional acts as expanding their forces through factional movesÂ€Âù and Â€Âœattempting to undermine the unitary leadership of the party.Â€Âù         South Korean intelligence officials said the language in the report was a signal that Mr. Kim who is 30 was uprooting a wide network of protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©s Mr. Jang had placed in party and military posts and doing it in a way that was meant to send a strong signal to others in the countryÂ€Â™s elite that he is firmly in charge. The report said that other Central Committee members representatives from provincial party committees and the PeopleÂ€Â™s Army attended the meeting as observers.         Mr. KimÂ€Â™s two years in power have been marked by a series of demotions promotions and purges of top party and military figures a tactic that was also used by his two predecessors Â€Â” Kim Jong-il his father and Mr. JangÂ€Â™s brother in law and Kim Il-sung Mr. KimÂ€Â™s grandfather and the founding president of North Korea. But it is highly unusual for the country to publicize its internal political machinations by holding an extended party meeting and announcing its results publicly.         The Korean news report said that speakers at the meeting criticized the Jang group Â€Âœin unisonÂ€Âù and Â€Âœexpressed their firm resolution to remain true to the idea and leadership of Kim Jong-un.Â€Âù Anyone who impedes his authority will never be pardoned Â€Âœregardless of his or her position and meritsÂ€Âù it said.         Mr. Jang and his wife Kim Kyong-hee Kim Jong-ilÂ€Â™s sister were widely thought to be acting as regents for their nephew helping him establish his leadership after Kim Jong-ilÂ€Â™s death in December 2011. Mr. Jang held a series of influential titles in agencies of power headed by Mr. Kim including a seat on the Political Bureau and vice chairmanships of the Central Military Commission and the top government organ the National Defense Commission.         South Korean officials who have met Mr. Jang and analysts who follow developments in the North differ in assessing Mr. Jang. Some called him an ambitious machine politician who built his own power base while helping his inexperienced nephew setting the stage for Mr. Kim to eventually see him as a challenge to his monopoly of authority. Others said Mr. Jang was easygoing a hard drinker and keenly aware that his position was precarious in a totalitarian state where all agencies of power compete to demonstrate loyalty to the top leader often by plotting against one another.         The K.C.N.A. dispatch attributed a litany of Â€ÂœcrimesÂ€Âù to Mr. Jang and his associates.         It said they did Â€Âœenormous harmÂ€Âù by Â€Âœthrowing the state financial management system into confusion and committing such acts of treachery as selling off precious resources of the country at cheap prices.Â€Âù Mr. Kim had earlier complained that his country was squandering its iron ore and other resources by selling them cheaply to China as the North struggled to obtain hard currency under the tightened United Nations sanctions that following its missile and nuclear tests.         It also accused Mr. Jang of personal failings. Â€ÂœAffected by the capitalist way of living Jang committed irregularities and corruption and led a dissolute and depraved lifeÂ€Âù the dispatch said including Â€Âœimproper relations with several womenÂ€Âù and being Â€Âœwined and dined at back parlors of deluxe restaurants.Â€Âù It accused him of taking advantage of a trip abroad for medical treatment to use drugs and gamble at the partyÂ€Â™s expense.         The news of Mr. JangÂ€Â™s fall from grace emerged last week from a parliamentary briefing by South KoreaÂ€Â™s National Intelligence Service which specializes in spying on the North. It told lawmakers that two of Mr. JangÂ€Â™s most trusted aides were executed for corruption and that two of Mr. JangÂ€Â™s relatives who were serving as North Korean ambassadors were recalled.         The spy agency has often been criticized for being in the dark about big developments in the North Â€Â” it did not know that Kim Jong-il had died until the news was announced on North Korean television Â€Â” so the confirmation of Mr. JangÂ€Â™s ouster was seen as aiding the agencyÂ€Â™s credibility.        49,1E+14,0,Article,News,Magazine Assistants Add Social Media to Scheduling and Coffee Runs,Business Day,1400,5.583,5.692,Sergio Kletnoy was trapped in traffic and running behind schedule. As the executive assistant to Joanna Coles the editor of Cosmopolitan magazine Mr. Kletnoy had spent the day scheduling a December lunch for Ms. Coles booking her business trip to Boston and accompanying her to Chelsea where she made a speech before an online financial group while he held her purse. In a free moment he had interviewed the singer Betty Who for CosmopolitanÂ€Â™s blog and arranged for Ms. Coles to meet her as well.         Now he was urging the driver to swiftly return them to HearstÂ€Â™s Midtown headquarters. The timetable was tight. Ms. Coles had to dive into the premiere of Rebel WilsonÂ€Â™s new TV show Â€ÂœSuper Fun NightÂ€Âù while Mr. Kletnoy waited to interview the actress for the blog. In a few hours Mr. Kletnoy would head out to see the singer Lorde perform before interviewing her the following day.         Â€ÂœIt feels like her Duracell battery will never ever ever stopÂ€Âù Mr. Kletnoy 36 said of Ms. Coles. Â€ÂœJoanna goes 150 miles an hour and sometimes itÂ€Â™s hard to catch up.Â€Âù         He paused contemplating his own place in the fast-paced New York media world: Â€ÂœA year from nowÂ€Âù he said Â€Âœthere may be a cooler executive assistant to take my spot. So I donÂ€Â™t take it for granted.Â€Âù         Mr. KletnoyÂ€Â™s experience reflects the evolving role of magazine assistants who for years have been defined by the stinging indignities they endured at the hands of the industryÂ€Â™s most imperious editors Â€Â” famously brought to life in the 2003 book Â€ÂœThe Devil Wears PradaÂ€Âù and the subsequent film adaptation.         There are still bosses like Miranda Priestly in the magazine world barking at minions to book tables at the Lambs Club or having them trail behind them carrying half-eaten tuna sandwiches.         But as magazines deal with new financial challenges including budget cuts that have trimmed the staff few editors can afford to squander the employees they have left on tasks like hanging up their coats when they swoop into the office.         True fetching coffee may never completely disappear from the job description but assistants like Mr. Kletnoy have been empowered in part because they are part of a more connected generation. The modern assistant has an understanding of Facebook Twitter and Instagram that time-stretched (and old school) magazine executives lack and increasingly they are assuming responsibility for spreading the magazineÂ€Â™s message and brand across social media.         Richard David Story the editor in chief of Departures hired Lauren Weisberger after she worked as an assistant to Anna Wintour at Vogue. He later encouraged Ms. Weisberger to write about her experiences at the magazine which led to her best-selling book Â€ÂœThe Devil Wears Prada.Â€Âù Mr. Story said that when interviewing potential assistants Â€ÂœI ask the same old-fashioned questions I look at the same old-fashioned qualities.Â€Âù But he nevertheless sees fundamental differences in the qualities he is looking for now as opposed to years ago.         He might still ask job candidates how they would feel about picking up a vanilla skim latte assuming he would do the same for them in return but added Â€ÂœI need somebody completely up and running in the 21st-century style with all the digital and social media bells and whistles.Â€Âù         Mr. Kletnoy who has worked for Ms. Coles since 2007 first at Marie Claire seems to thrive in this role. At CosmopolitanÂ€Â™s 38th floor offices he dutifully completes his administrative tasks while he blogs tweets and poses for photographs with the celebrities who pass through. While Mr. Kletnoy humors Ms. ColesÂ€Â™s love of Cyndi Lauper he insisted she meet a more current performer the pop singer Ellie Goulding when she arrived in the United States for a tour and more recently with the 14-year-old singer Madison Beer. He also provided the music mix Jennifer Lopez listened to during her fashion shoot for the October cover.        34,1E+14,1,Article,News,The Nakeds Next Door,Home & Garden,638,5.427,5.769,Shannon Sessoms has never been so ready for winter. Cold weather brings the promise of several months without awkward sightings of the neighbors whom her family refers to as the Nakeds.         Ms. Sessoms who lives with her husband and two young children in Harlem first spotted one of the Nakeds two summers ago while enjoying a glass of wine on her apartment balcony one evening. The balcony overlooks the backyards of several brownstones and out of the one directly opposite her emerged a 40ish woman with dreadlocks wearing nothing but a T-shirt.

Â€ÂœThe husband was grilling nakedÂ€Âù Ms. Sessoms said. Â€ÂœThatÂ€Â™s a little dangerous.Â€Âù         Ms. Sessoms was recalling these events on an unseasonably warm fall afternoon a few weeks ago on the same balcony that overlooks her neighborsÂ€Â™ yard. It was the kind of day a reporter pointed out that a nudist might regard as an invitation for a late-season frolic.

Many others are getting health insurance for the first time in years giving them alternatives to seeking care through free clinics or emergency rooms Â€Â” or putting it off indefinitely.         Not all who need health insurance are happy with their new options. Many have complained that the prices are too high especially if they earn too much to qualify for federal subsidies.

Using the tenets of so-called New Journalism the magazine helped popularize the knowing skeptical voices of writers including Tom Wolfe Jimmy Breslin Gloria Steinem and Nora Ephron. It was the birthplace of both Ms. Magazine and the concept of Â€Âœradical chic.Â€Âù         Now this magazine that has been at the vanguard of Manhattan publishing for almost five decades is acknowledging that the cutting edge is not necessarily a lucrative or sustainable proposition at least on the same schedule.         Beginning in March New York will retreat from its long-standing status as a weekly and come out every other week instead.         Along with the closing of the printed Newsweek and the planned spin-off of Time Inc. which includes the weeklies Time and People the move to bi-weekly publishing represents the end of an era and underscores the dreary economics of print and its diminishing role in a future thatÂ€Â™s already here.         The change will beget misty eyes from magazine geeks Â€Â” myself among them Â€Â” while other consumers will shrug and dive into the ever-changing web version of New York magazine that shows up in their browser.         The weekly schedule of New York has already been squeezed so that the magazine comes out only 42 weeks a year. Soon it will be 26 times a year with three additional special issues Â€Â” best doctors the annual gift guide and a food-and-drink issue.         So will the world or even just that of New York publishing tip over because there are 13 fewer issues? No but something palpable and intrinsically thrilling will be lost with the change in rhythm to a magazine that has been hitting the streets on a weekly basis for more than four decades.         Adam Moss New YorkÂ€Â™s editor in chief acknowledges it is a bit of a moment. But last week he confidently detailed the logic as he stood in the conference room of the magazineÂ€Â™s lower Manhattan offices showing off poster boards displaying alternative concepts for the cover redesigned interior sections and a more visually driven approach to telling stories.         Â€ÂœWeÂ€Â™ve talked about this for a while and you canÂ€Â™t help but get wistful about itÂ€Âù he said as Lawrence C. Burstein the magazineÂ€Â™s publisher and Michael Silberman general manager of the online operation listened. Â€ÂœBut I would be more concerned if we didnÂ€Â™t address how the market and peopleÂ€Â™s reading habits have changed. I would not be doing this if I didnÂ€Â™t believe we could make a better magazine and continue to grow what we do both in print and online.Â€Âù         The punishing economics of being a stand-alone weekly can be explained in one word: Newsweek.         The cost structure at a weekly makes the drop in ads across the industry an existential threat and as happened at Newsweek its benefactor is no longer in the picture: Bruce Wasserstein bought New York in 2004 and  By all accounts his heirs are dedicated owners but they know as well as anyone that Newsweek sold for $1 in 2010 and after its new owner Sidney Harman died limped along in a doomed merger with The Daily Beast until it ceased print publication last year.

New York magazineÂ€Â™s web traffic grew 19 percent in the last eight months to more than nine million unique visitors a month according to comScore. But to keep up that rate of growth in a competitive set that includes publicly held companies like The New York Times and upstarts like the venture-capital backed online news site BuzzFeed the magazine had to reduce costs to find the money to fund the part of the business that is growing.        98,1E+14,0,Article,News,Crowd Battles Police in Singapore District,World,228,5.771,4.891,SINGAPORE Â€Â” A crowd set fire to vehicles and clashed with the police in the Indian district of  According to various reports the disturbance began after a private bus struck and killed a foreign worker in the Little India area.

But China also looked weak when initially it did nothing after America flew two B-52 bombers on Nov. 26 through the air defense zone Â€Â” a tactic copied by Japan and South Korea which sent undeclared military aircraft into the zone.         In short this will not go down as ChinaÂ€Â™s finest hour in international diplomacy. Yet China may unwittingly have done the world a favor. Until this declaration few people had heard of Â€Âœair defense identification zones.Â€Âù Even fewer were aware that several countries had created such zones without any multilaterally agreed upon rules to govern their establishment.         The United States ordained the first air defense zone: over North America in 1950. It also set one up over Japan during its post-World War II occupation of that country. Japan inherited the claim to that airspace in 1969.         Since these zones were first established however the world has changed beyond recognition. In todayÂ€Â™s situation any unilateral move by a country has an immediate impact on its neighbors and on the world as a whole.         It may in fact serve AmericaÂ€Â™s interests to take the lead on formulating multilateral rules. In 2003 President Bill Clinton wisely posed the question to his fellow Americans of whether the United States Â€Âœshould be trying to create a world with rules and partnerships and habits of behavior that we would like to live in when weÂ€Â™re no longer the military political economic superpower in the world.Â€Âù Whether or not Mr. Clinton was thinking of ChinaÂ€Â™s rising power this latest play in the East China Sea certainly suggests ChinaÂ€Â™s ambition to compete for superpower status.         Responding to ChinaÂ€Â™s declaration of the new zone the U.S. State Department noted Â€ÂœFreedom of overflight and other internationally lawful uses of sea and airspace are essential to prosperity stability and security in the Pacific.Â€Âù These lawful uses which include commercial air traffic are protected by the Law of the Sea Treaty Â€Â” an accord that has been ratified by 166 out of 193 member states in the United Nations. Sadly the only major country that has not ratified it is the United States. Congress is not yet convinced that it is in AmericaÂ€Â™s interest to create multilateral rules preferring to reserve the right to act unilaterally.         Leading American figures have long urged China to act as a Â€Âœresponsible stakeholderÂ€Âù in the global system. But the best way for the United States to convey such encouragement is through deeds not words.         Do we really want to live in a world where each country follows the example of America and China and establishes unilateral claims to international airspace? This hardly seems wise at a time when global air traffic has doubled every 15 years since 1980 and is forecast to double again over the next 15 years.         Recognizing the threat that noncompliance might pose to civilian aircraft the Federal Aviation Administration advised American commercial airlines to abide by ChinaÂ€Â™s rules. This concession also helped China save face but we are moving toward a more dangerous world if we permit every country the right to create air defense zones with distinct and different rules. A multiplicity of rules will lead to confusion for civilian airlines and pilots. Instead we should create simple and clear multilateral rules binding for all countries.         U.S. officials accompanying Mr. Biden said that the status of the new zone is now Â€Âœup to China.Â€Âù But the world needs the United States to take the lead. The question is whether America will give up its own claim to unilateral action to do so.         73,1E+14,0,Article,Op-Ed,The Punishment Cure,Opinion,781,5.798,5.326,Six years have passed since the United States economy entered the Great Recession four and a half since it officially began to recover but long-term unemployment remains disastrously high.

How exactly will they find jobs when there are Proponents of this story like to  The  Ask yourself how exactly ending unemployment benefits would create more jobs. ItÂ€Â™s true that some of the currently unemployed finding themselves even more desperate than before might manage to snatch jobs away from those who currently have them. But what would give businesses a reason to employ more workers as opposed to replacing existing workers?         You might be tempted to argue that more intense competition among workers would lead to lower wages and that cheap labor would encourage hiring. But that argument involves a fallacy of composition. Cut the wages of some workers relative to those of other workers and those accepting the wage cuts may gain a competitive edge. Cut everyoneÂ€Â™s wages however and nobody gains an edge. All that happens is a general fall in income Â€Â” which among other things increases the burden of household debt and is therefore a net negative for overall employment.         The point is that employment in todayÂ€Â™s American economy is limited by demand not supply. Businesses arenÂ€Â™t failing to hire because they canÂ€Â™t find willing workers; theyÂ€Â™re failing to hire because they canÂ€Â™t find enough customers. And slashing unemployment benefits Â€Â” which would have the side effect of reducing incomes and hence consumer spending Â€Â” would just make the situation worse.         Still donÂ€Â™t expect prominent Republicans to change their views except maybe to come up with additional reasons to punish the unemployed.

People gathered in houses of worship private homes and even open fields to pay homage to the man who embodied the struggle against apartheid.         For the countryÂ€Â™s politicians Sunday was a day to urge unity and continuity after the death of Mr. Mandela at 95 on Thursday and national and provincial officials including President Jacob Zuma appeared at churches and other places of worship across the country.         In Bryanston near Johannesburg Mr. Zuma attended a Methodist service sitting alongside members of Mr. MandelaÂ€Â™s family and his former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Mr. Mandela received his early education in Methodist schools.         Â€ÂœWe should not forget the values that Madiba stood for and sacrificed his life forÂ€Âù Mr. Zuma said referring to Mr. Mandela by his clan name as he urged South Africans to be guided by Mr. MandelaÂ€Â™s example as an opponent of oppression a fighter for freedom and a model of forgiveness.         For others the eulogies were freighted with concern about the future adding a sharper edge to their prayers for peace in the post-Mandela era. In the vast squatter camp of Diepsloot north of central Johannesburg where thousands of South Africans and immigrants live in tin shacks with no plumbing and often no electricity people gathered in tin-walled churches under trees and in fields to offer prayers for Mr. Mandela.         Â€ÂœThank you MadibaÂ€Âù a group of women from Zimbabwe sang plaintively in a meadow of wildflowers.         Â€ÂœNelson Mandela was a leader chosen by God and now God has called him homeÂ€Âù said Virginia Sibanda a 40-year-old housekeeper from Harare ZimbabweÂ€Â™s capital who has lived in Diepsloot for nearly two decades. Â€ÂœHe was a leader not just for South Africa but for all Africans and the world.Â€Âù         Many migrants living in Diepsloot worried that Mr. MandelaÂ€Â™s death would leave them more vulnerable to the xenophobic attacks they have suffered in recent years. With rising crime joblessness and deteriorating living conditions South Africans have frequently turned on those from other countries. Mr. Mandela and his foundation had sought to reduce such violence.         Â€ÂœRumors have been passing through the town that once Mandela dies we immigrants will be attackedÂ€Âù said Nkosi Nkomo the pastor of a small church with a largely Zimbabwean congregation.

In other parts of the world people also congregated to remember Mr. Mandela whose long incarceration and subsequent election as South AfricaÂ€Â™s first black president inspired a following far beyond the frontiers of his land.

You might imagine that speculations along these lines are the province of a radical fringe. And they are indeed radical; but fringe not so much. A number of economists have been flirting with  And if Mr. Summers is right everything respectable people have been saying about economic policy is wrong and will keep being wrong for a long time.         Mr. Summers began with a point that should be obvious but is often missed: The financial crisis that started the Great Recession is now far behind us. Indeed by most measures it ended more than four years ago. Yet our economy remains depressed.         He then made a related point: Before the crisis we had a huge housing and debt bubble. Yet even with this huge bubble boosting spending the overall economy was only so-so Â€Â” the job market was O.K. but not great and the boom was never powerful enough to produce significant inflationary pressure.         Mr. Summers went on to draw a remarkable moral: We have he suggested an economy whose normal condition is one of inadequate demand Â€Â” of at least mild depression Â€Â” and which only gets anywhere close to full employment when it is being buoyed by bubbles.         IÂ€Â™d weigh in with some further evidence. Look at  Again the evidence suggests that we have become an economy whose normal state is one of mild depression whose brief episodes of prosperity occur only thanks to bubbles and unsustainable borrowing.         Why might this be happening? One answer could be slowing population growth. A growing population creates a demand for new houses new office buildings and so on; when growth slows that demand drops off. AmericaÂ€Â™s working-age population rose rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s as baby boomers grew up and its work force rose even faster as women moved into the labor market. ThatÂ€Â™s now all behind us. And you can see the effects: Even at the height of the housing bubble we werenÂ€Â™t building nearly as many  Another important factor may be  Why does all of this matter? One answer is that central bankers need to stop talking about Â€Âœexit strategies.Â€Âù Easy money should and probably will be with us for a very long time. This in turn means we can forget all those scare stories about government debt which run along the lines of Â€ÂœIt may not be a problem now but just wait until interest rates rise.Â€Âù         More broadly if our economy has a persistent tendency toward depression weÂ€Â™re going to be living under the looking-glass rules of depression economics Â€Â” in which virtue is vice and prudence is folly in which attempts to save more (including attempts to reduce budget deficits) make everyone worse off Â€Â” for a long time.         I know that many people just hate this kind of talk. It offends their sense of rightness indeed their sense of morality. Economics is supposed to be about making hard choices (at other peopleÂ€Â™s expense naturally). ItÂ€Â™s not supposed to be about persuading people to spend more.

Zach Parise scored twice Â€Â” once into an empty net Â€Â” and Mikko Koivu added a goal for the Wild who have won three of four.         Patrick Marleau scored with 1:41 left for San Jose which went 1-3 on a four-game trip. The Sharks who have lost three in a row in regulation for the first time this season are 0-5-1 in their last six games in Minnesota.         Antti Niemi made 10 saves.         Parise and Koivu scored second-period goals to give Minnesota a 2-0 lead. Parise pushed the Wild's edge back to two goals when he scored at 19:54.         Harding who improved to 13-1 at home is 16-4-3 overall. He entered the game with an NHL-best 1.52 goals-against average and he moved into a second-place tie with Niemi and Pittsburgh's Marc-Andre Fleury for most wins.         It was the second straight game Minnesota allowed a high number of shots. The Wild were outshot 41-20 in a 4-0 loss at Columbus on Friday.         Harding didn't play in that game and he was more than up to the task against the Sharks. He was at his best in the second period stopping 21 shots including quickly getting his glove up to rob Joe Pavelski on a slap shot from the left circle. The Sharks had just six shots in the third period.         Two days after Sharks coach Todd McLellan questioned his team's energy level following a 5-3 loss in Carolina San Jose came out more aggressive.         The Sharks got the puck deep in the offensive end and outshot Minnesota 11-5 in the first period. Despite Harding giving up a number of prime rebounds the Sharks couldn't score.         However a rebound led to Parise's first goal early in the second period.         With Jason Pominville about to crash into him Niemi blocked a slap shot from Marco Scandella but the rebound was picked up by Parise in front. He quickly shifted the puck to his backhand and put a shot into the empty net.         Koivu made it 2-0 a little more than four minutes later. He received a drop pass from Jared Spurgeon just inside the San Jose blue line cut to his left and beat Niemi with a wrist shot on the stick side.         Niemi was pulled for an extra skater with 2:15 to play and Marleau got the Sharks on the board by squeezing a rebound between Harding and the left post.

As for your belief that people ought to know about the high-performance feats of modern-day cars the premise of the commercial seems to be that when car buyers see a Camry Â€Â“ with its image as a safe choice a prosaic everyday even boring car Â€Â“ they yawn and move on to something more dashing.         That is underlined by comments made at the start of the commercial like Â€ÂœThis is a car to go grocery shopping inÂ€Âù as well as by the comments at the end of the ride that included Â€ÂœI had no idea we were capable of doing something like that.Â€Âù Maybe the ignorance of the CamryÂ€Â™s exciting side was exaggerated but then exaggeration for effect is a venerable Madison Avenue tactic.            52,kJVEBzhuPw8n/RQ9VLZc3A,1,Blogs,Blog Post,Child-Proofing 'Harry Potter',Style,3389,6.461,6.119,"T h e   s e c o n d   P r o f e s s o r   M c G o n a g a l l   p u l l s   O l i v e r   W o o d   f r o m   h i s   c h a r m s   c l a s s ,   I   r e a l i z e   I â€™ m   i n   â€œ P i n k a l i c i o u s â€ù   t e r r i t o r y   a g a i n .

The intensifying  Â€ÂœWe have to have fuel so we have to have some kind of refueling centerÂ€Âù Valerie Amos the United Nations official told the mayor Alfred S. Romualdez at a public meeting after she flew here for an assessment.         Mr. Romualdez told Ms. Amos that the city could not easily cope with the influx of aid workers as practically no vehicles were available to bring them in from the airport while food and drinking water were running out. Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m asking those who come here Â€Â˜Please be self-sufficient because thereÂ€Â™s nothingÂ€Â™Ã‚Â Â€Âù he said.         The mayorÂ€Â™s best advice to residents was to leave and find shelter with relatives if they could saying that the local authorities were struggling to provide food and water and faced difficulties in maintaining law and order.         The paralysis was epitomized by the first attempt in Tacloban to conduct a mass burial of typhoon victims whose corpses had been putrefying for days on the streets and under piles of debris. The attempt ended in failure as trucks carrying more than 200 corpses were forced to turn back when they faced gunfire at the city limits. The identities of the gunmen were not clear.         Covered with black plastic tarpaulin the bodies were returned to a makeshift outdoor morgue at the foot of the hill topped by City Hall where they emitted a powerful odor in the tropical heat.         TaclobanÂ€Â™s paralysis was acknowledged later in the day by the United States government which is playing a major role in the emergency effort using military cargo planes to bring in aid and to evacuate the most vulnerable residents. In a telephone briefing from Washington a senior official assigned to the effort said that it was focused mainly on food water shelter and medicine but that the provision of fuel in the city was Â€Âœvery much on our radar screen Â€Â” that is a whole part of the logistical morass weÂ€Â™re working our way through.Â€Âù         Another senior American official in the briefing said that the number of American uniformed personnel on the ground in the Philippines currently at about 300 would rise to 1000 in the next few days with most coming from a Marine base in Okinawa Japan. The official said the United States was helping transport Filipino soldiers assigned to the disaster zone which cuts through the middle of the country.         The American officials also said a land route into Tacloban had been reopened which would ease the bottleneck at the airport. Â€ÂœIt was like squeezing orange juice through a strawÂ€Âù one said. Â€ÂœNow we have more straws.Â€Âù         International relief groups said they were rapidly escalating their response in Tacloban and elsewhere. Doctors Without Borders the Paris-based medical agency said its teams had traveled by car boat plane and helicopter to some of the outlying areas of northern Cebu Island eastern Samar Island Panay Island and western Leyte Province which neither the Philippine government nor other agencies had been able to reach. The teams found desperation the group said in a  Â€ÂœAccess is extremely difficult and is preventing people from receiving helpÂ€Âù said Dr. Natasha Reyes the groupÂ€Â™s emergency coordinator in the Philippines.         Despite the problems in Tacloban the World Food Program  Mayor Romualdez said the city desperately needed trucks and drivers to distribute shipments of food piling up at the airport as well as more trucks heavy equipment and personnel to retrieve decaying corpses from the wreckage across the city.         Â€ÂœI have to decide at every meeting which is more important relief goods or picking up cadaversÂ€Âù he said.        85,1E+14,1,Article,Op-Ed,Are We Alone in the Universe?,Opinion,744,5.883,5.779,TEMPE Ariz. Â€Â” THE recent announcement by a team of astronomers that there could be as many as 40 billion habitable planets in our galaxy has further fueled the speculation popular even among many distinguished scientists that the universe is teeming with life.         The astronomer Geoffrey W. Marcy of the University of California Berkeley an experienced planet hunter and co-author of the study that generated the finding said that it Â€Âœrepresents one great leap toward the possibility of life including intelligent life in the universe.Â€Âù         But Â€ÂœpossibilityÂ€Âù is not the same as likelihood. If a planet is to be inhabited rather than merely habitable two basic requirements must be met: the planet must first be suitable and then life must emerge on it at some stage.         What can be said about the chances of life starting up on a habitable planet? Darwin gave us a powerful explanation of how life on  When I was a student in the 1960s the prevailing view among scientists was that life on Earth was a freak phenomenon the result of a sequence of chemical accidents so rare that they would be unlikely to have happened twice in the observable universe. Â€ÂœMan at last knows he is alone in the unfeeling immensity of the universe out of which he has emerged only by chanceÂ€Âù wrote the biologist Jacques Monod. Today the pendulum has swung dramatically and many distinguished scientists claim that life will almost inevitably arise in Earthlike conditions. Yet this decisive shift in view is based on little more than a hunch rather than an improved understanding of lifeÂ€Â™s origin.         The underlying problem is complexity. Even the simplest bacterium is at the molecular level staggeringly complex. Although we have no idea of the minimal complexity of a living organism it is likely to be very high. It could be that some sort of complexifying principle operates in nature serving to drive a chaotic mix of chemicals on a fast track to a primitive microbe. If so no hint of such a principle has been found in laboratory experiments to re-create the basic building blocks of life.         On the other hand if life arose simply by the accumulation of many specific chemical accidents in one place it is easy to imagine that only one in say a trillion trillion habitable planets would ever host such a dream run. Set against a number that big Â€Â” and once you decide a series of unlikely accidents is behind the creation of life you get enormous odds very easily Â€Â” it is irrelevant whether the Milky Way contains 40 billion habitable planets or just a handful. Forty billion makes hardly a dent in a trillion trillion.         So we are stuck. Life may indeed pop up readily in Earthlike conditions or it may be a fluke unique in the observable universe. Because we are a product of this cosmic accident we cannot conclude that Earth is typical. No statistical evidence can be drawn from a sample of one.         The easiest way to settle the matter is to find a second sample of life one that arose from scratch independent of known life. The inventory of extrasolar planets being discovered is an extremely useful first step. In the future our telescopes should be able to analyze the atmospheres of some of these planets for telltale signs of biological activity.         But evidence favoring lifeÂ€Â™s high probability could exist closer to home. No planet is more Earthlike than Earth itself. If life does pop up readily in Earthlike conditions then it should have started many times right here on our own planet. It could be that intermingled among the seething microbes all around us are some that are so biochemically different they could be descended only from a separate origin. You couldnÂ€Â™t tell by looking only by delving into their molecular innards and finding something weird enough to rule out a common precursor. The discovery of just a single Â€ÂœalienÂ€Âù microbe under our very noses would be enough to conclude that the universe was indeed teeming with life.         It would also address a deep philosophical question. Although the pathway from microbes to complex thinking beings like humans may still be a very difficult one at least we know the mechanism whereby it happens Â€Â” Darwinian evolution. If microbial life is widespread in the cosmos we can expect that at least here and there sentient beings will evolve. We would then be much closer to answering that age-old puzzle of existence: Are we alone in the universe?        39,1E+14,0,Article,News,Dayâ€™s Best in the N.F.L.,Sports,396,5.5,5.751,The   The BroncosÂ€Â™   The VikingsÂ€Â™   8:40 p.m. ESPN         Line: Cowboys by 1         Although Dallas is 11-15 in December when Tony Romo starts at quarterback even the most ardent believers in astrological charts would have to chalk that up largely to coincidence.

Grubauer 22 was mobbed by teammates as the Rangers were booed off the ice.         Rangers players held a closed-door meeting after the game before speaking with the news media. The move did not impress an irked Alain Vigneault the RangersÂ€Â™ first-year coach.         Â€ÂœYou can talk all you want; you have to have those words become actions on the iceÂ€Âù Vigneault said. Â€ÂœWe need to play a smart high-percentage good puck-movement game.Â€Âù         Virtually none of VigneaultÂ€Â™s vision was on display for the ineffective Rangers against the speedier and more attentive Capitals.         Washington (16-12-2) completed a successful weekend also recording a 5-2 home win over Nashville on Saturday. The Capitals are in second place behind the Pittsburgh Penguins in the eight-team Metropolitan Division.         The Rangers fell to 15-15-1 as they continued to be a model of mediocrity.         Â€ÂœRight now we are a .500 hockey teamÂ€Âù Vigneault said. Â€ÂœWhen the other team scores a goal we donÂ€Â™t seem to have much of a push.Â€Âù         After a lethargic and scoreless first period the Capitals broke through at 2 minutes 28 seconds of the second when Jason Chimera poked the puck past Henrik Lundqvist in a goal-mouth scramble for his sixth goal of the season.         Steve Oleksy added to the margin 25 seconds later when his slap shot from the right point sailed over LundqvistÂ€Â™s left shoulder. It was the first goal this season for Oleksy who added an assist along with Martin Erat on ChimeraÂ€Â™s goal.         Mikhail Grabovski scored his ninth of the season at 18:26 on a penalty shot called after defenseman Ryan McDonagh hooked the Capitals center. Grabovski skated and wove in slowly toward Lundqvist before winding up and blasting a slap shot from close range over LundqvistÂ€Â™s shoulder.         Â€ÂœThe penalty shot was big made it 3-0Â€Âù Capitals Coach Adam Oates said. Â€ÂœThe place was kind of quiet which is always a good feeling on the road.Â€Âù         A visibly irate Lundqvist who last week signed a seven-year $59.5 million contract extension slammed his stick on the crossbar as the second-period buzzer sounded.         Lundqvist who made 32 saves lost for the second time in two days after beating Buffalo last Thursday. The soft-spoken but exceptionally intense goaltender is growing frustrated with his teamÂ€Â™s inconsistent play.         Â€ÂœI think we all just have to look at ourselves here and see what we can improveÂ€Âù Lundqvist said. Â€ÂœThereÂ€Â™s no point in looking over your shoulder for an answer. Coach yourself and try to be better.Â€Âù         Eric Fehr tipped in Nate SchmidtÂ€Â™s slap shot to make it 4-0 at 17:03 of the third before the RangersÂ€Â™ Benoit Pouliot ruined GrubauerÂ€Â™s shutout bid with a tip-in at 18:07.         Grubauer was otherwise solid in his first start of the season and only the second of his career. He was recalled from Hershey of the American Hockey League on Nov. 30 after the backup Michal Neuvirth was injured the day before.         Â€ÂœIt was great a lot of funÂ€Âù Grubauer said. Â€ÂœThe guys were great in front of me and we got the win which is all that matters.Â€Âù         The CapitalsÂ€Â™ Alexander Ovechkin who leads the league with 22 goals engaged in a brief scuffle late in the second with Rick Nash. Both players were penalized two minutes for roughing.         The Rangers played without defenseman Marc Staal who sustained a hit to the jaw against the Devils. Vigneault said before SundayÂ€Â™s game that Staal who missed significant time the past two seasons with a concussion and serious eye injury was dealing with neck problems.         Staal collided with the DevilsÂ€Â™ Reid Boucher in the third period Saturday. He played only 46 games because of a concussion during the 2011-12 season. He then sustained a frightening eye injury last March when he was hit in the face by a puck against Philadelphia. Staal played only 21 games and one playoff game last season.         Michael Del Zotto a frequent healthy scratch by Vigneault in recent weeks replaced Staal in the lineup.         The Rangers host Nashville on Tuesday.         Â€ÂœI know how we want to play and I know how this group needs to playÂ€Âù Vigneault said. Â€ÂœWe are going to have to find a way and itÂ€Â™s going to start on Tuesday.Â€Âù         Slap Shots         Forward Dominic Moore was a healthy scratch for the Rangers who also were without Derek Dorsett (wrist).

Only 100 to 150 people were onboard Â€Â” department store employees who were bracing for another busy after-Thanksgiving day tourists from Texas who wanted to climb the Statue of Liberty a police officer moonlighting as a security guard on his day off.         Some were dozing when the train rounded a bend near where tracks pass under the Henry Hudson Bridge. Some were listening to music on headphones. Suddenly with a jerk that disrupted the steady trainÂ€Â™s steady rhythm their world turned upside down as they were hurled from one side to the other.         In the chaos of screeching metal and the shower of debris as the train kept plowing along some passengers grabbed for the luggage racks and held on. Others hugged their seats as the eight cars of the train flew off the tracks and several landed on their sides.         Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m thinking IÂ€Â™m going into the waterÂ€Âù said Eddie Russell 48 who had been listening with his eyes closed to LL Cool J. Â€ÂœI was thinking of me surviving.Â€Âù         Police and transit officials said four people on board were killed and more than 60 were injured 11 critically. Three of the four dead were thrown from the train after the windows blew out the officials said.         It was not clear how fast the Metro-North train was going. But an official from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the train operator had reported that the train was going into the turn too fast and that he had performed an emergency braking maneuver.         The operator told the first rescuers to reach the scene that he had Â€ÂœdumpedÂ€Âù the brakes according to the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.         Dumping the brakes railroad experts said is a last-resort move that has the effect of slamming on the emergency brakes on all the cars of a train at once. It is usually done to avert a collision with another train or a vehicle at a grade-level crossing.         Officials opened an investigation but cautioned that it would take time to piece together the evidence and identify a possible cause. The National Transportation Safety Board sent investigators to the site with instructions to inspect the overturned cars and interpret information from the trainÂ€Â™s Â€Âœevent recordersÂ€Âù devices that are somewhat similar to the flight recorders on airplanes. The Federal Railroad Administration also dispatched a team of investigators.         Earl F. Weener of the transportation safety board said at a morning news conference with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo that investigators had yet to interview the operator of the train who was among those injured. A spokeswoman for Metro-North said the engineer identified as William Rockefeller of Germantown N.Y. had about 14 yearsÂ€Â™ experience with the line. There were also three conductors on the train.         Â€ÂœOur mission is to not just understand what happened but why it happened with the intent of preventing it from happening againÂ€Âù Mr. Weener said.         The accident was the latest episode in a trying year for Metro-North the nationÂ€Â™s second-largest commuter railroad and the first with passenger fatalities in Metro-NorthÂ€Â™s 30-year history.         In May two Metro-North trains slammed into each other near Fairfield Conn. during the evening rush. Scores of passengers were hurt five critically.         And in July a CSX freight train derailed near where the Metro-North train left the tracks on Sunday. Officials said there was no connection between the accidents.         By Sunday night the transportation safety board had given Metro-North clearance to begin removing the crippled train and repairing the tracks. But the crash was likely to disrupt the Monday commute for thousands of passengers on the railroadÂ€Â™s Hudson line. Metro-North arranged for buses to take Hudson line passengers to White Plains N.Y. on Sunday to catch trains on a different line that was running normally. On Monday Hudson line trains will be running as far south as Yonkers where passengers will be able to catch buses to the 242nd Street station of the No. 1 train.        95,1E+14,1,Article,News,â€˜Leave of Absenceâ€™ for Lara Logan After Flawed Benghazi Report,Business Day,645,5.491,5.454,The CBS News correspondent Lara Logan and her producer Max McClellan made serious errors in an Oct. 27 report on the attack on the American compound in Benghazi Libya and will take leaves of absence the network announced on Tuesday. Four Americans died in the Sept. 11 2012 attack including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.         The moves come after weeks of criticism directed at a Â€Âœ60 MinutesÂ€Âù report which was based on an interview with a hired security agent Dylan Davies whose comments to CBS News were later discredited.         CBS did not specify the length of the leave of absence for its two staff members nor whether they would continue to be paid. In general television correspondents do not lose salary unless they are suspended.         Beyond Ms. Logan who has been a rising star at CBS News the review could have implications for the leadership of Jeffrey Fager the chairman of CBS News who is also the executive producer of Â€Âœ60 Minutes.Â€Âù Mr. Fager sent an email to the staff on Tuesday saying: Â€ÂœAs executive producer I am responsible for what gets on the air. I pride myself in catching almost everything but this deception got through and it shouldnÂ€Â™t have.Â€Âù         He added: Â€ÂœWe are making adjustments at Â€Â™60 MinutesÂ€Â™ to reduce the chances of it happening again.Â€Âù         Mr. Fager has enjoyed a strong reputation both inside and outside CBS News division for emphasizing a hard news approach on the networkÂ€Â™s news programs but one fallout from the discredited report may be continued questions about his dual role as both the top executive at CBS News and the person in charge of its highest-rated most profitable and best-known program Â€Âœ60 Minutes.Â€Âù         One area likely to be examined is the potential addition of a specific executive outside of the program itself who would vet the pieces about to be presented on Â€Âœ60 Minutes.Â€Âù That position existed for years inside CBS News headed most recently by Linda Mason. But after Ms. Mason retired from the network at the start of 2013 that level of oversight over Â€Âœ60 MinutesÂ€Âù was eliminated.         The review of the Benghazi segment conducted by CBS NewsÂ€Â™s executive director of standards and practices Al Ortiz was unstinting in its evaluation of the report which Mr. Ortiz called Â€Âœdeficient in several respects.Â€Âù         Perhaps chief among the deficiencies according to Mr. OrtizÂ€Â™s review was that the account Mr. Davies gave to Ms. Logan and Mr. McClellan differed from versions he had provided both to his employer Blue Mountain and to the F.B.I. This discrepancy Mr. Ortiz writes Â€Âœwas knowable before the piece aired.Â€Âù         In a previous interview with The New York Times Mr. Fager said CBS had tried talking to the F.B.I. in advance of the report in an effort to determine what Mr. Davies had told the agency. The networkÂ€Â™s sources led the program to believe that the account given to the F.B.I. was Â€Âœin syncÂ€Âù with the interview Mr. Davies gave to Â€Âœ60 MinutesÂ€Âù Mr. Fager said.         In defense of its report CBS said earlier that it had been duped by Mr. Davies. Mr. Ortiz contradicted that by saying CBS could have and should have been able to verify Mr. DaviesÂ€Â™s account before presenting him as a reliable source.         Â€ÂœThe wider reporting resources of CBS News were not employed in an effort to confirm his accountÂ€Âù Mr. Ortiz wrote. He concluded: Â€ÂœLogan and producer Max McClellan told me they found no reason to doubt DaviesÂ€Â™s account and found no holes in his story. But the team did not sufficiently vet DaviesÂ€Â™s account of his own actions and whereabouts that night.Â€Âù         The report also criticizes Ms. Logan for not adequately substantiating her conclusion that Al Qaeda took part in the attack and for making a speech in October 2012 that took a position on the attack and then participating in a story in which she would have been expected to be objective about the facts of the attack.        93,1E+14,1,Article,News,"Train Engineer Was Dazed Before Crash, Lawyer Says",N.Y. / Region,842,5.828,5.322,The engineer who operated the Metro-North Railroad train that derailed over the weekend killing four people and injuring more than 70 told the authorities on Tuesday that he had become dazed before the accident suffering what his lawyer referred to as Â€Âœhighway hypnosis.Â€Âù         The account was delivered as federal investigators said they had found no apparent problems with the trainÂ€Â™s brakes or other equipment.         The engineer William Rockefeller met with investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board and detectives from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and New York City police for more than three hours on Tuesday Â€Â” at one point tearing up according to his lawyer Jeffrey P. Chartier.         Mr. Chartier said Mr. Rockefeller was cooperating fully and was Â€Âœextremely remorseful.Â€Âù         Mr. Rockefeller told them that when he regained full awareness he shut down the throttle tried an emergency braking maneuver and braced for impact Mr. Chartier said. He added that after the crash Mr. Rockefeller opened the bulkhead door and helped passengers. The safety board did not immediately confirm this.         The train barreled into a curve at 82 miles per hour nearly three times the speed allowed through the area just north of the Spuyten Duyvil station in the Bronx.         Commuting has been disrupted on the railroadÂ€Â™s Hudson line since all seven of the trainÂ€Â™s cars and the locomotive derailed around 7:20 a.m. on Sunday though the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is expected to resume near-normal service on Wednesday morning.         A union representative Anthony Bottalico the acting director of the Association of Commuter Rail Employees told reporters that in a conversation Mr. Rockefeller had described nodding off just before the derailment.         Â€ÂœPeople use the word Â€Â˜zoned outÂ€Â™ Â€Â˜nodÂ€Â™ Â€Â˜fell asleepÂ€Â™Ã‚Â Â€Âœ he said. Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m not a sleep expert.Â€Âù         In a rare move the safety board said late Tuesday that it had removed the union as a party to the investigation because Mr. Bottalico had Â€Âœdiscussed and interpreted information related to the ongoing investigationÂ€Âù with the media. Ã‚Â One of the few times the board has kicked investigators off its team also involved a New York accident in 1995 after a subway crash on the Williamsburg Bridge.         The board which is leading the investigation cautioned that many circumstances remained unclear and that human error had not been determined as the definitive cause.         To date though the agency has not revealed any significant track or equipment deficiencies.         Earl Weener a member of the safety board said there were Â€Âœno anomalies or degradation of the braking performance as the trip went along.Â€Âù         Mr. Weener said Mr. Rockefeller Â€Â” whose route began before 6 a.m. in Poughkeepsie a new schedule he had had since Nov. 17 Â€Â” was in the second day of a five-day workweek.         He reported to work at 5:04 a.m. on Sunday Mr. Weener said.         Mr. Chartier said Mr. Rockefeller reported going to bed about 8:30 p.m. Saturday and arose about seven hours later.         Mr. Weener said alcohol tests for the trainÂ€Â™s crew came back negative. Drug test results were not yet available.         The crash has also attracted the attention of the Federal Railroad Administration which said in a letter to the transportation authority that it had Â€Âœserious concernsÂ€Âù about the authorityÂ€Â™s recent safety record.         A spokeswoman for the authority Marjorie Anders said some trains on Metro-North included Â€ÂœalerterÂ€Âù systems that can sound an alarm if inactivity is detected. If an engineer does not respond by pushing a button within 15 seconds she said the brakes are applied. She said the train that derailed had no such system.         The front car where Mr. Rockefeller was positioned had a Â€Âœdead manÂ€Â™s pedalÂ€Âù on the floor. Pressure must be applied to avoid automatic braking.         Officials have said that the brakes were not fully applied until five seconds before the locomotive in the rear of the train came to a stop.         Detectives from the New York City and Metropolitan Transportation Authority police with assistance from the Bronx district attorneyÂ€Â™s office are collecting evidence to examine if officials determine that a crime occurred.         A law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of continuing investigations said a preliminary examination of Mr. RockefellerÂ€Â™s phone did not seem to indicate he had been texting or on a call.         Mr. Chartier said Mr. RockefellerÂ€Â™s phone had been off.         Even if investigators conclude that Mr. Rockefeller erred in operating the train any potential prosecution could be complicated. One possible precedent came last year when  Patrick L. Bruno the lawyer for Mr. Williams in his criminal case said that if Mr. Rockefeller was found to have been distracted or impaired in any way the cases appeared at least somewhat analogous.         Â€ÂœI would maintain youÂ€Â™re talking about a civil issue a lawsuit issueÂ€Âù he said Â€Âœnot about prosecuting a man.Â€Âù         Rail safety experts have suggested that a system known as positive train control might have prevented the derailment. One of its features is to slow trains as they go around bends.         A federal law requires the authority to install positive train control by 2015         With all the rail cars removed track repairs were quickly made. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Tuesday that the Hudson line was expected to resume 98 percent of its regular service by the Wednesday morning rush.        15,1E+14,1,Article,News,"24,000-Year-Old Body Shows Kinship to Europeans and American Indians",Science,660,5.594,5.568,The genome of a young boy buried at MalÂ€Â™ta near Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia some 24000 years ago has turned out to hold two surprises for anthropologists.         The first is that the boyÂ€Â™s DNA matches that of Western Europeans showing that during the last Ice Age people from Europe had reached farther east across Eurasia than previously supposed. Though none of the MalÂ€Â™ta boyÂ€Â™s skin or hair survives his genes suggest he would have had brown hair brown eyes and freckled skin.         The second surprise is that his DNA also matches a large proportion Â€Â” about 25 percent Â€Â” of the DNA of living Native Americans. The first people to arrive in the Americas have long been assumed to have descended from Siberian populations related to East Asians. It now seems that they may be a mixture between the Western Europeans who had reached Siberia and an East Asian population.         The MalÂ€Â™ta boy was 3 to 4 years old and was buried under a stone slab wearing an ivory diadem a bead necklace and a bird-shaped pendant. Elsewhere at the same site about 30 Venus figurines were found of the kind produced by the Upper Paleolithic cultures of Europe. The remains were excavated by Russian archaeologists over a 20-year period ending in 1958 and stored in museums in St. Petersburg.         There they lay for some 50 years until they were examined by a team led by  But the first results were disappointing. The boyÂ€Â™s mitochondrial DNA belonged to the lineage known as U which is commonly found among the modern humans who first entered Europe about 44000 years ago. The lineages found among Native Americans are those designated A B C D and X so the U lineage pointed to contamination of the bone by the archaeologists or museum curators who had handled it a common problem with ancient DNA projects. Â€ÂœThe study was put on low speed for about a year because I thought it was all contaminationÂ€Âù Dr. Willerslev said.         His team proceeded anyway to analyze the nuclear genome which contains the major part of human inheritance. They were amazed when the nuclear genome also turned out to have partly European ancestry. Examining the genome from a second Siberian grave site that of an adult who died 17000 years ago they found the same markers of European origin. Together the two genomes indicate that descendants of the modern humans who entered Europe had spread much farther east across Eurasia than had previously been assumed and occupied Siberia during an extremely cold period starting 20000 years ago that is known as the Last Glacial Maximum.         The other surprise from the MalÂ€Â™ta boyÂ€Â™s genome was that it matched to both Europeans and Native Americans but not to East Asians. Dr. WillerslevÂ€Â™s interpretation was that the ancestors of Native Americans had already separated from the East Asian population when they interbred with the people of the MalÂ€Â™ta culture and that this admixed population then crossed over the Beringian land bridge that then lay between Siberia and Alaska to become a founding population of Native Americans.         Â€ÂœWe estimate that 14 to 38 percent of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient populationÂ€Âù he and colleagues wrote in an article published Wednesday in the journal  A European contribution to Native American ancestry could explain two longstanding puzzles about the peopleÂ€Â™s origins. One is that many ancient Native American skulls including that of the well-known Kennewick man look very different from those of the present day population. Another is that one of the five mitochondrial DNA lineages found in Native Americans the lineage known as X also occurs in Europeans. One explanation is that Europeans managed to cross the Atlantic in small boats some 20000 years ago and joined the Native Americans from Siberia.         Dr. Willerslev thinks it more likely that European bearers of the X lineage had migrated across Siberia with the ancestors of the MalÂ€Â™ta culture and joined them in their trek across the Beringian land bridge.        5,1E+14,1,Article,News,Car Mechanic Dreams Up a Tool to Ease Births,Health,906,5.325,5.609,The idea came to Jorge OdÃƒÂ_n as he slept.

And the Â€ÂœaffordableÂ€Âù bit wasnÂ€Â™t just about subsidizing premiums. It was also supposed to be about Â€Âœbending the curveÂ€Âù Â€Â” slowing the seemingly inexorable rise in health costs.         Much of the Beltway establishment scoffed at the promise of cost savings. The prevalent attitude in Washington is that reform isnÂ€Â™t real unless the little people suffer; serious savings are supposed to come from things like  So howÂ€Â™s it going? The health exchanges are off to a famously rocky start but many though by no means all of the cost-control measures have already kicked in. Has the curve been bent?         The answer amazingly is yes. In fact  O.K. the obligatory caveats. First of all we donÂ€Â™t know how long the good news will last. Health costs in the United States slowed dramatically in the 1990s (although not this dramatically) probably thanks to the rise of health maintenance organizations but cost growth picked up again after 2000. Second we donÂ€Â™t know for sure how much of the good news is because of the Affordable Care Act.         Still the facts are striking. Since 2010 when the act was passed real health spending per capita Â€Â” that is total spending adjusted for overall inflation and population growth Â€Â” has risen less than a third as rapidly as its long-term average. Real spending per Medicare recipient hasnÂ€Â™t risen at all; real spending per Medicaid beneficiary has actually fallen slightly.         What could account for this good news? One obvious answer is the still-depressed economy which might be causing people to forgo expensive medical care. But this explanation turns out to be problematic in multiple ways. For one thing the economy had stabilized by 2010 even if the recovery was fairly weak yet health costs continued to slow. For another itÂ€Â™s hard to see why a weak economy would have more effect in reducing the prices of health services than it has on overall inflation. Finally Medicare spending shouldnÂ€Â™t be affected by the weak economy yet it has slowed even more dramatically than private spending.         A better story focuses on what appears to be a decline in some kinds of medical innovation Â€Â” in particular an absence of expensive new blockbuster drugs even as existing drugs go off-patent and can be replaced with cheaper generic brands. This is a real phenomenon; it is in fact the main reason the Medicare drug program has ended up costing less than originally projected. But since drugs are only about 10 percent of health spending it can only explain so much.         So what aspects of Obamacare might be causing health costs to slow? One clear answer is the actÂ€Â™s reduction in Medicare Â€ÂœoverpaymentsÂ€Âù Â€Â” mainly a reduction in the subsidies to private insurers offering Medicare Advantage Plans but also cuts in some provider payments. A less certain but likely source of savings involves changes in the way Medicare pays for services. The program now penalizes hospitals if many of their patients end up being readmitted soon after being released Â€Â” an indicator of poor care Â€Â” and readmission rates have in fact fallen substantially. Medicare is also encouraging a shift from fee-for-service in which doctors and hospitals get paid by the procedure to Â€Âœaccountable careÂ€Âù in which health organizations get rewarded for overall success in improving care while controlling costs.         Furthermore thereÂ€Â™s evidence that Medicare savings Â€Âœspill overÂ€Âù to the rest of the health care system Â€Â” that when Medicare manages to slow cost growth private insurance gets cheaper too.

The two films shared best picture in the awards announced Sunday by the L.A. critics but ""Gravity"" was the top award-winner. The innovatively made lost-in-space drama won for best director (Alfonso Cuaron) best editing (Cuaron and Mark Sanger) and best cinematography (Emmanuel Lubezki).         ""Her"" which is about a man (Joaquin Phoenix) who falls in love with his computer operating system (voiced by Scarlet Johansson) also won for K.K. Barrett's sleek near-future production design. But the critics otherwise spread its honors around.         Dual winners were the theme. Best actress was shared by Cate Blanchett for her fallen socialite in Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"" and Adele Exarchopoulos for the lesbian coming-of-age tale ""Blue Is the Warmest Color."" (The later film also won for best foreign language film.)         Best supporting actor was also a two-fer with the group jointly honoring Jared Leto's performance as an HIV-positive transsexual in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" and more surprisingly James Franco's performance as the cornrowed gangster Alien in ""Spring Breakers.""         Best actor went to Bruce Dern for his performance in Alexander Payne's father-son road trip ""Nebraska.""

The debate has been between those most notably Sweden who argue that prostitution is a form of predatory violence against women and must be punished and those like Germany and Denmark who maintain that criminalizing prostitution only drives it underground and exposes sex workers to greater dangers. These and other arguments Â€Â” the right to sexual freedom the hypocrisy of punishing clients but not the prostitutes the danger of driving sex workers farther from city centers Â€Â” sounded loudly across France.         In the end what pushed the French National Assembly to act Â€Â” and what may soon compel Germany to follow suit Â€Â” is the growing number of prostitutes from poorer countries like Romania Bulgaria Nigeria China and Thailand. Nine out of 10 prostitutes in France are reported to be of foreign origin and many are presumed to be victims of sex traffickers.         The French law is intended to reduce the market by fining those who pay for sex up to 1500 euros about $2000 while providing programs for sex workers to train for different work. It would also set up a fund to offer protection to prostitutes who want to leave the sex business including short-term residence permits for foreigners.         The law will not eradicate prostitution; no law ever has. But governments around the world are increasingly guided by the idea that sex workers are victims themselves and should be helped rather than punished.

Ahead of Curve in Fatal Crash,N.Y. / Region,663,5.689,5.311,The Metro-North Railroad train that hurtled off the rails on a sleepy holiday weekend morning was traveling 82 miles per hour as it approached one of the sharpest curves in the regionÂ€Â™s rail system federal investigators said on Monday Â€Â” nearly three times the speed permitted through the turn.         The throttle was still engaged Â€Â” giving the engine power Â€Â” until six seconds before the locomotive in the rear of the train came to a stop around 7:20 a.m. Sunday after the train careered toward the Harlem River killing four people and injuring more than 70 north of Spuyten Duyvil station in the Bronx officials said.         The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation and a board member Earl Weener said the trainÂ€Â™s sudden power shift came Â€Âœvery late in the game.Â€Âù The board cautioned that it remained unclear if the speed was the result of human error or faulty equipment.         But the extraordinary speed shed new light on the deadliest New York City train derailment in more than two decades and heightened the focus on the veteran engineer at the center of the investigation. The maximum allowable speed through the curve is 30 m.p.h.; even the straightaway north of the crash site permits speeds no greater than 70 m.p.h.         Asked if the safety board was looking into the possibility that the engineer William Rockefeller fell asleep was using his cellphone or was otherwise distracted a spokesman for the board Keith Holloway said Â€ÂœPart of our investigation as in all investigations is to look at human performance factors.Â€Âù         Mr. RockefellerÂ€Â™s cellphone was recovered as Â€Âœpart of our routine processÂ€Âù Mr. Weener said and the results of drug and alcohol tests conducted after the crash were not yet known. Mr. Rockefeller was treated at a hospital and released.         The authorities said that the trainÂ€Â™s brakes appeared to have been operating effectively shortly before the crash.         Â€ÂœWe are not aware of any problems or anomalies with the brakesÂ€Âù Mr. Weener said.         Senator Charles E. Schumer noted Â€ÂœThe train did make nine stops before coming to this curve. So clearly the brakes were working a short time before.Â€Âù         He added that he was told by the safety board that the tracks in the area also seemed to have been in proper condition.         The revelations came as workers raised the train cars Â€Â” all seven and the locomotive had been derailed Â€Â” and thousands of commuters were forced to use alternative routes. The police and prosecutors began a parallel investigation to see if a crime had been committed.         The safety boardÂ€Â™s interview with Mr. Rockefeller a Metro-North employee who lives in Germantown N.Y. was cut short Monday afternoon and is to continue this week officials said.         Anthony Bottalico the acting director of the Association of Commuter Rail Employees said that the interview was postponed because of Â€Âœthe trauma of the whole thing and the lack of sleepÂ€Âù for Mr. Rockefeller.         Several law enforcement officials said that detectives from the New York City and Metropolitan Transportation Authority police with assistance from the office of the Bronx district attorney Robert T. Johnson were mounting an investigation parallel to the safety boardÂ€Â™s inquiry.         That was being done to collect evidence if officials determine a crime occurred three law enforcement officials said. The safety board is not a law enforcement agency; its role is limited to issuing findings and making recommendations.         Prosecutors from Mr. JohnsonÂ€Â™s office were at the scene of the derailment on Sunday and two officials said the prosecutors had issued subpoenas for the engineerÂ€Â™s blood samples for drug and alcohol testing and for his cellphone.         Mr. Bottalico predicted that Â€Âœwhen all is said and done hereÂ€Âù the authorities would find there was Â€Âœno criminal intent.Â€Âù         A senior official with the transportation authority has said that Mr. Rockefeller initially told emergency workers that he Â€Âœdumped the brakesÂ€Âù an emergency maneuver after he realized he was traveling too quickly.         Mr. Weener said that six seconds before the rear locomotive came to a stop Â€Âœthe throttle was reduced to idle.Â€Âù The brakes were fully applied one second later.        7,1E+14,1,Article,News,Experts Reshape Treatment Guide for Cholesterol,Health,596,5.707,5.212,The nationÂ€Â™s leading heart organizations released new guidelines on Tuesday that will fundamentally reshape the use of cholesterol-lowering statin medicines which are now prescribed for a quarter of Americans over 40. Patients on statins will no longer need to lower their cholesterol levels to specific numerical targets monitored by regular blood tests as has been recommended for decades. Simply taking the right dose of a statin will be sufficient the guidelines say.         The  Everyone else should be considered for a statin if his or her risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years is at least 7.5 percent. Doctors are advised to use a  Â€ÂœNow one in four Americans over 40 will be saying Â€Â˜Should I be taking this anymore?Â€Â™ Â€Âù said Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Yale who was not on the guidelines committee.         The  It is not clear whether more or fewer people will end up taking the drugs under the new guidelines experts said. Many women and African-Americans who have a higher-than-average risk of stroke may find themselves candidates for treatment but others taking statins only to lower LDL cholesterol to target levels may no longer need them.         The previous guidelines put such a strong emphasis on lowering cholesterol levels by specific amounts that patients who did not hit their target levels just by taking statins often were prescribed additional drugs like Zetia made by Merck. But the new guidelines say doctors should no longer prescribe those extra medicines because they have never been shown to prevent heart attacks or strokes.         Zetia has been viewed with increasing skepticism in recent years since studies showed it lowered LDL cholesterol but did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or death. Still it is among MerckÂ€Â™s top-selling drugs earning $2.6 billion last year. Another drug Vytorin which combines Zetia with a statin brought in $1.8 billion in 2012 according to company filings. And in May  The new guidelines are part of a package of recommendations to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke that includes moderate exercise and a healthy diet. But its advice on cholesterol is the flash point arousing the ire of critics who say the authors ignored evidence that did not come from gold-standard clinical trials and should also have counted less rigorous but compelling data.         For example Dr. Daniel J. Rader the director of the preventive cardiovascular medicine and lipid clinic at the University of Pennsylvania points to studies of people with genes giving them low LDL levels over a lifetime. Their heart attack rate is greatly reduced he said suggesting the benefits of long-term cholesterol reduction.         Committee members counter his view saying that cholesterol lowered by drugs may not have the same effect.         Critics also question the use of a 10-year risk of heart attack or stroke as the measure for determining who should be treated. Many people will have a lower risk simply because they are younger yet could benefit from taking statins for decades to keep their cholesterol levels low they say.         Dr. Rader and other experts also worry that without the goad of target numbers patients and their doctors will lose motivation to control cholesterol levels.         Experts say it is still unclear how much the new guidelines will change clinical practice. Dr. Rader suspects many cardiologists will still strive for the old LDL targets at least for patients with heart disease who are at high risk. Â€ÂœThey are used to it and believe in itÂ€Âù he said.         Dr. Steven E. Nissen a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic said he thought it would take years for doctors to change their practices.        38,1E+14,0,Article,News,Union in Position to Defend Indefensible,Sports,931,5.904,5.365,The role of the N.H.L. PlayersÂ€Â™ Association in on-ice disciplinary matters has fallen under the spotlight again after two ugly episodes in Saturday nightÂ€Â™s game in Boston one involving the  Neal is scheduled to speak by phone Monday with Brendan Shanahan of the leagueÂ€Â™s department of player safety after he kneed Brad Marchand who was lying on the ice in the head as he skated past. Marchand was not injured on the play. Neal faces a fine and possibly a suspension of up to five games.         Thornton will meet with Shanahan later in the week and could face a suspension of six or more games for slew-footing PittsburghÂ€Â™s Brooks Orpik during a stoppage causing him to fall backward to the ice then punching Orpik in the head. Orpik was taken off the ice on a stretcher and was released later that night from a hospital. He returned to Pittsburgh with the team.         The players association will represent Neal and Thornton and could appeal any disciplinary measures against either player Â€Â” as is the unionÂ€Â™s right under the collective bargaining agreement that went into effect this season. They could first appeal to Commissioner Gary Bettman and if he were to uphold a suspension of six or more games the union could then appeal to an independent arbitrator.         On Twitter blogs and sports radio shows fans and commentators were calling for longer suspensions for Neal and Thornton and were questioning why the union had not spoken out against such violent plays. Under the new C.B.A. two appeals Â€Â” one on behalf of BuffaloÂ€Â™s Patrick Kaleta and another on behalf of PhoenixÂ€Â™s Paul Bissonnette Â€Â” were filed with Bettman. None have been filed with an arbitrator. Bettman upheld KaletaÂ€Â™s 10-game suspension for a high stick but he reduced BissonnetteÂ€Â™s 10-game sentence to three for leaving the bench illegally.         The union has argued that a player injured in an on-ice incident would not be a party to such disciplinary processes because the point is not to compensate or vindicate him but rather to arrive at an appropriate penalty for the accused player.         David Gregory executive director of the Center for Labor and Employment Law at St. JohnÂ€Â™s University said the players union might eventually face consequences if it is seen as protecting the interests of accused players to the exclusion of the injured players.         Â€ÂœThere is the ominous possibility that at some point a hockey stick could be used as a lethal weapon and if the union has not acted proactively to prevent such actions it could be seen as complicitÂ€Âù Gregory said.         But there is a side of the debate that argues the N.H.L. is reluctant to impose longer suspensions for fear of triggering an appeal process that goes beyond Bettman and to an arbitrator who could drastically reduce a suspension.         With the possible exception of football though no sport must measure out appropriate discipline for injurious play as much as hockey. That presents a special challenge for its union.         At least one sports union has a record of speaking out on behalf of one of its members when his health or career is threatened by the actions of another member.         Gordon Taylor chairman of the Professional FootballersÂ€Â™ Association which represents soccer players in England denounced LiverpoolÂ€Â™s Luis SuÃƒÂ¡rez for biting ChelseaÂ€Â™s Branislav Ivanovic during a match in April.         Â€ÂœIt is very depressing and embarrassing that it should happenÂ€Âù Taylor said at the time. Â€ÂœPlayers are role models and are highly rewarded. This sets such a bad example.Â€Âù         In 1998 a Professional FootballersÂ€Â™ Association official called out a union member Slaven Bilic of Croatia for feigning a head injury that resulted in FranceÂ€Â™s Laurent Blanc receiving a red card in a World Cup semifinal. The official denounced BilicÂ€Â™s ruse as Â€ÂœsadÂ€Âù saying Â€ÂœThere are a lot of impressionable youngsters watching and we should be highlighting the positive aspects of the game.Â€Âù         Blanc was not part of the leagueÂ€Â™s union but the official spoke out in his defense nevertheless.         The N.H.L. PlayersÂ€Â™ Association does not publicly side with parties in on-ice incidents nor has it voiced disapproval of its members for acting inappropriately in games.         But union officials say that the N.H.L.Â€Â™s disciplinary procedures under the C.B.A. are not intended to condone or encourage on-ice misconduct. The unionÂ€Â™s role they say is to ensure a fair and impartial disciplinary process so that evenhanded and consistent league discipline will act as the most effective deterrent to bad play.         Â€ÂœUnion members can harass or harm other members in any workplaceÂ€Âù said David Doorey a law professor at York University in Toronto. Â€ÂœUnions are obviously concerned about the victims in these cases but that concern must be balanced against their legal obligation to represent members who are disciplined. ItÂ€Â™s an unhappy position for unions no matter the workplace.Â€Âù         Unions Doorey says try to police the disciplinary process to hold employers to a consistent application of rules Â€Â” especially when the workplace is a professional hockey rink.         Â€ÂœThe N.H.L. has not consistently applied harsh disciplinary measures for violent hockey incidentsÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœOften thereÂ€Â™s no discipline at all. So the N.H.L.P.A. has proper grounds to question almost every disciplinary decision.Â€Âù         Thornton said he was sorry for his actions against Orpik; Neal did not apologize but suggested he might have been in the wrong for not skating around Marchand.         But until players stop committing such actions they will continue to put the N.H.L. and their union in the embarrassing position of adjudicating and defending the appalling acts they commit.        76,1E+14,0,Article,News,Bringing Back the Artistic Beauty of a 19th-Century Church,N.Y. / Region,772,5.484,5.763,The stunningly decorated sanctuary of St. AnselmÂ€Â™s Church in the South Bronx is a marvel of art and architecture capturing Byzantine Greek Italian and German styles. No glistening detail is random from the gold band circling the balconies Â€Â” a reminder of GodÂ€Â™s crowning glory Â€Â” to the 12 side pillars one for each apostle.         A similar mix is reflected in the Roman Catholic congregation whose members hail from at least 16 countries. Under one roof they are of one heart.         Â€ÂœSeeing a structure like this you see that the church is universalÂ€Âù said Luis Laboy a member of the parishÂ€Â™s Holy Name Society. Â€ÂœIt makes me think about how our country was founded on religious freedom. And when I think about who participated in building this church and the different designs they used you can see that liberty right here in this place.Â€Âù         Unfortunately you can also see the deterioration in the church which was founded in 1892 by Benedictine monks from Germany and inspired by the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. Hundreds of cracks in the building have had to be filled but leaks from the dome have run down the walls harming elaborate frescoes and murals. There have been improvised repairs. A bronze latticework encircling the imposing baptismal font was painted over in black. A former pastor actually repainted large sections of a mural of the Last Judgment that had been done by a monk who was a master artist.         Â€ÂœIt looks like a kindergarten painting nowÂ€Âù said  Mr. Cano has been working on and off since 2006 when the churchÂ€Â™s pastor the Rev. Antonio Palacios met him during a retreat in Vermont. He was so excited by the prospect of working in this one-of-a-kind church that he drove down to the Bronx that very night to assess the structure.         After months of study he estimated that 90 percent of the building could be restored.         What was not so easily attainable was the approximately $4.5 million needed to finance the project. Though the church is rich in history and art its surrounding neighborhood tucked between the Melrose and Longwood areas is home to a population of modest means.         Father Palacios who vowed to restore the church the moment he first saw it when he arrived 13 years ago said his conversations with archdiocesan officials had resulted in their sending engineers and architects to conduct surveys. And he hopes that just as officials raised about $175 million to renovate St. PatrickÂ€Â™s Cathedral they might persuade benefactors to help out in the South Bronx.         For all the glory of the churchÂ€Â™s interior the most important work right now is the most prosaic. The roof Â€Â” a collection of domes Â€Â” needs to be redone with copper to keep out water and prevent further damage. To that end State approval came last week and federal approval should follow in the coming months. The designation would allow St. Anselm to receive preservation grants although they would cover only a portion of the total repair cost.         Â€ÂœThis building is a treasureÂ€Âù said Ann Friedman who runs the conservancyÂ€Â™s Sacred Sites program. Â€ÂœIt is a building that deserves more attention funding ongoing restoration and investment from the broader New York community.Â€Âù         Father Palacios hopes to attract tourists making the argument Why fly to Istanbul when an echo of the Hagia Sophia is but a subway ride away? Mr. Cano agrees and he has seen and worked on a lot of churches whose grandeur does not approach St. AnselmÂ€Â™s.         Â€ÂœI had a chance to work on a church in Berlin and another one in FranceÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœI decided to stay in the Bronx even though there is no money right now. The challenge is bigger and that makes it more important.Â€Âù         Granted some of his fellow conservators thought he was crazy going to the South Bronx. They warned him to watch his car if not his life. He shrugged it off.         Â€ÂœThis has been a gift to meÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœNothing happened to me here except the Bronx stole my heart.

But after they canvassed bakeries and restaurants Internet cafes and bubble tea shops and buttonholed scores of workers and customers who were mostly suspicious if not downright hostile the challenge of their mission had begun to weigh on them.         Â€ÂœChipping away at the iceÂ€Âù sighed Susan Pan the legal fellow at  Across the country immigrant advocates have been confronting similar challenges amid a renewed push to sign up immigrants for the program known as  The effort has acquired a sense of urgency as comprehensive immigration legislation has stalled in Congress dimming the possibility that lawmakers Â€Â” at least in the near term Â€Â” might provide a path to citizenship for those here illegally.         The program President ObamaÂ€Â™s signature immigration initiative is open to certain immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Recipients of the reprieve are protected from deportation allowed to work and in many states to obtain a driverÂ€Â™s license; they can renew their status after two years.         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s the only game in town right now for undocumented immigrants and we need to do everything to maximize participation in the programÂ€Âù said Steven Choi executive director of the  When the program  Advocates and government officials view the program Â€Â” and the challenge of boosting participation rates Â€Â” as a test run for the far more complicated process that would come with legislation that included a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11.7 million immigrants who are in the country illegally.         The  But the participation rate has varied wildly depending on the immigrant group: It was at 66 percent among Mexicans 59 percent among Hondurans and 55 percent among Brazilians while only 16 percent of Filipinos 14 percent of Dominicans and fewer than 9 percent of Chinese have signed up according to a Among states with large immigrant populations participation was also uneven. In North Carolina 74 percent of those eligible had signed up and in Georgia 63 percent. But the rate was only 35 percent in Florida and 34 percent in New York.         Analysts have offered several possible reasons for the regional variations including differences in the enforcement of immigration laws the availability of public transportation and the corresponding need for a driverÂ€Â™s license.         But the range in application rates among immigrant groups has been harder to figure out they said.         The initiative was quickly embraced by many Latinos who were already heavily invested in the so-called Dreamer movement Â€Â” the push for legal status and educational benefits for immigrants without papers who were brought to the country as children. Much of the movementÂ€Â™s leadership is Latino giving comfort to other Latino immigrants to come forward and reveal their immigration status.         But in populations with less visible leadership among the undocumented that step has been more daunting.         Â€ÂœThe Chinese werenÂ€Â™t the first people to line up at the door on Aug. 15Â€Âù said Mae Lee executive director of the  At deferred action clinics early on some legal service providers were asked by non-Latino youths if the initiative was only for Mexicans.         In addition outreach efforts to some immigrant populations have been limited in part because of a lack of money. Meanwhile the populations that have had the highest participation rates most notably the Mexicans have had not only an elaborate network of activist groups but also proactive consulates that help their nationals apply.         Cultural inhibitions might also explain in part why some groups have been reluctant to come forward in larger numbers.         Within some Asian immigrant populations particularly the Chinese there was a well-nourished sense of shame associated with being undocumented advocates said.

It was a publicity stunt for advocates of an audacious social policy that just might become reality in the tiny rich country. Along with the coins activists delivered 125000 signatures Â€Â” enough to trigger a Swiss public referendum this time on providing a monthly income to every citizen no strings attached. Every month every Swiss person would receive a check from the government no matter how rich or poor how hardworking or lazy how old or young. Poverty would disappear. Economists needless to say are sharply divided on what would reappear in its place Â€Â” and whether such a basic-income scheme might have some appeal for other less socialist countries too.         The proposal is in part the brainchild of a German-born artist named Enno Schmidt a leader in the basic-income movement. He knows it sounds a bit crazy. He thought the same when someone first described the policy to him too. Â€ÂœI tell people not to think about it for others but think about it for themselvesÂ€Âù Schmidt told me. Â€ÂœWhat would you do if you had that income? What if you were taking care of a child or an elderly person?Â€Âù Schmidt said that the basic income would provide some dignity and security to the poor especially EuropeÂ€Â™s underemployed and unemployed. It would also he said help unleash creativity and entrepreneurialism: SwitzerlandÂ€Â™s workers would feel empowered to work the way they wanted to rather than the way they had to just to get by. He even went so far as to compare it to a civil rights movement like womenÂ€Â™s suffrage or ending slavery.         When we spoke Schmidt repeatedly described the policy as Â€Âœ Go to a cocktail party in Berlin and there is always someone spouting off about the benefits of a basic income just as you might hear someone talking up Robin Hood taxes in New York or single-payer health care in Washington. And itÂ€Â™s not only in vogue in wealthy Switzerland. Beleaguered and debt-wracked Cyprus is weighing the implementation of basic incomes too. They even are whispered about in the United States where certain wonks on the libertarian right and liberal left have come to a strange convergence around the idea Â€Â” some prefer an unconditional Â€ÂœbasicÂ€Âù income that would go out to everyone no strings attached; others a means-tested Â€ÂœminimumÂ€Âù income to supplement the earnings of the poor up to a given level.         The case from the right is one of expediency and efficacy. LetÂ€Â™s say that Congress decided to provide a basic income through the tax code or by expanding the Social Security program. Such a system might work better and be fairer than the current patchwork of programs including welfare food stamps and housing vouchers. A single father with two jobs and two children would no longer have to worry about the hassle of visiting a bunch of offices to receive benefits. And giving him a single lump sum might help him use his federal dollars better. Housing vouchers have to be spent on housing food stamps on food. Those dollars would be more valuable Â€Â” both to the recipient and the economy at large Â€Â” if they were fungible.         Even better conservatives think such a program could significantly reduce the size of our federal bureaucracy. It could take the place of welfare food stamps housing vouchers and hundreds of other programs all at once: Hello basic income; goodbye H.U.D. Charles Murray of the conservative American Enterprise Institute has proposed a minimum income for just that reason Â€Â” feed the poor and starve the beast. Â€ÂœGive the money to the peopleÂ€Âù Murray wrote in his book Â€ÂœIn Our Hands: A Plan to Replace the Welfare State.Â€Âù He suggested guaranteeing $10000 a year to anyone meeting the following conditions: be American be over 21 stay out of jail and Â€Â” as he once quipped Â€Â” Â€Âœhave a pulse.Â€Âù        187,1E+14,0,Article,News,Golf Capsules,Sports,913,5.095,5.554,THOUSAND OAKS Calif. Â€Â” Zach Johnson put together the storybook finish at Sherwood on Sunday that for the longest time belonged to Tiger Woods.         Johnson rallied from four shots behind with eight holes to play holed out from a drop area for par on the last hole to force a playoff and beat the No. 1 player in golf at the World Challenge when Woods missed a 5-foot par putt on the first extra hole.         It was an extraordinary sendoff at Sherwood which hosted the World Challenge for the 14th and final time before it moves to Florida next year.         For Woods it was only the fourth time in his career that he lost a lead of at least two shots going into the final round the second time at Sherwood. Graeme McDowell overcame a four-shot deficit in 2010 and beat Woods in a playoff.         This was far more dramatic.         They were tied after Johnson hit his tee shot to 4 feet for birdie on the 17th hole. Playing from the left rough Woods came up just short and watched his approach tumble down the elevated green and into the bunker. Johnson followed with an 8-iron so weak that it came up well short and into the hazard.         Johnson knew Woods had a difficult bunker shot and if he figured if he could stick his wedge close from 58 yards away in the drop zone a bogey might be enough to get into a playoff. The ball bounced three times and then spun back a few inches into the cup for an unlikely par and a 4-under 68.         Woods' hit a superb bunker shot to 2 feet and matched his par for a 70. They finished at 13-under 275.         Woods was between clubs from the 18th fairway in the playoff and tried a smooth 7-iron that he lost enough to the right that it again found the bunker. He hit an exquisite sand shot this one sliding 5 feet by the hole and the par putt spun out of the left side.         Johnson won $1 million and should go to No. 9 in the world.         HONG KONG OPEN         HONG KONG (AP) Â€Â” Miguel Angel Jimenez successfully defended his Hong Kong Open title Sunday to extend his record as the oldest winner in European Tour history.         The Spaniard won at 49 years 337 days to break the record he set last year at Hong Kong Golf Club holing an 18-foot birdie on the first hole of a playoff with Thailand's Prom Meesawat and Wales' Stuart Manley.         Jimenez won the event for the fourth time to match the tournament victory record set by Taiwan's Hsieh Yong Yo the winner in 1963 '64 '75 and '78. Jimenez also won in 2004 and 2007. He has 20 European Tour victories a tour-record 13 since turning 40.         Jimenez closed with a 4-under 66 to match Meesawat at 12-under 268. Manley holed a birdie chip on the final hole of regulation for a 68 and Meesawat had two eagles in a 65.         NEDBANK GOLF CHALLENGE         SUN CITY South Africa (AP) Â€Â” Denmark's Thomas Bjorn had two back-nine eagles in a comeback victory in the Nedbank Golf Challenge         The 42-year-old Bjorn closed with a 7-under 65 for a two-stroke victory over Wales' Jamie Donaldson amd Spain's Sergio Garcia.         Bjorn finished at 20-under 268 at Gary Player Country Club. He earned $1.25 million for his 15th European Tour title.         Donaldson three strokes ahead entering the round closed with a 70. Garcia had a 65.         Bjorn's 5-iron into No. 10 set up the first eagle to move past Donaldson. The Dane had his second on No. 14 after his approach hit a bunker and rolled up onto the green.         The victory was hailed by fans waving streams of South African flags in late afternoon sunshine on a day dedicated in the country to prayer and reflection following the death of former President Nelson Mandela.         SWINGING SKIRTS WORLD LADIES MASTERS         TAIPEI Taiwan (AP) Â€Â” Lydia Ko rallied to win her first title as a professional.         The 16-year-old from New Zealand won the Swinging Skirts World Ladies Masters closing with a 4-under 68 for a three-stroke victory over South Korea's So Yeon Ryu.         Ko had an 11-under 205 total at Linkou Miramar and earned $150000 in the event sanctioned by the Taiwan and Korean tours. Ryu finished with a 73. Top-ranked Inbee Park was third at 7 under after a 70.         Ko tied for 21st last month in the LPGA Titleholders in her only other start as a professional. She won four pro events as an amateur taking the Canadian Women's Open the last two years.         LPGA TOUR QUALIFYING TOURNAMENT         DAYTONA BEACH Fla. (AP) Â€Â” Jaye Marie Green completed a runaway victory in the LPGA Tour qualifying tournament finishing with a record 29-under 331 total for a 10-stroke margin.         The 19-year-old Green from Boca Raton closed with a 4-under 68 on LPGA International's Jones Course. She broke the event 90-hole mark of 18-under 342 set by Stacy Lewis in 2008.         The top 20 earned Category 12 status the next 26 players received membership in Category 17 and the other 22 players who made the 72-hole cut got Symetra Tour status.         South Korea's Mi Rim Lee was second after a 69. Tiffany Joh finished third at 15 under after a 71.         Amy Anderson the 21-year-old former North Dakota State star who won a record 20 college titles was fourth at 14 under after a 69.        172,1E+14,0,Article,News,Woods Finds Good and Bad in Sherwood Farewell,Sports,603,5.216,5.773,"THOUSAND OAKS California Â€Â” Tournament host Tiger Woods expressed bitter-sweet feelings after he lost out in a playoff for the Northwestern Mutual World Challenge on Sunday as the elite event ended a run of 14 years in California.         Next December the World Challenge will shift to Isleworth Country Club outside Orlando in Florida but Woods will long treasure memories of his five previous victories here and the $25 million raised by the tournament for his foundation.         ""It is very sad to obviously leave Sherwood (Country Club) because there are so many great memories for me personally"" world number one Woods told reporters after being beaten at the first extra hole by fellow American Zach Johnson.         ""This was the last time my dad (Earl) ever got a chance to watch me play live and this event has always had special meaning for my father and me.         ""Without this event we wouldn't be able to build the learning center which we did down in Orange County and over 100000 kids have now gone through our facilities.""         Woods World Challenge champion in 2001 2004 2006 2007 and 2011 had been bidding for his sixth tournament victory of 2013 but was still able to reflect on a highly successful campaign after being denied by Johnson.         ""Pretty damn good year"" said Woods who won a season-high five times on the PGA Tour before being voted Player of the Year for a record 11th time.         ""Five wins and you know on some pretty good venues so I'm very pleased with the year.""         Though Woods failed to add to his career haul of 14 majors he won five of his first 11 PGA Tour events clinching the Farmers Insurance Open the WGC-Cadillac Championship the Arnold Palmer Invitational the Players Championship and the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.         MAJOR LIKING         Woods especially likes the look of the venues for next year's majors.         He has always enjoyed playing at Augusta (Masters) has placed second and third in the last two U.S. Opens staged at Pinehurst and has previously triumphed at both Hoylake (2006 British Open) and Valhalla (2000 PGA Championship).         ""I've won at every one except for Pinehurst and I'm trending in the right way"" Woods said. ""I've finished third second. You get the picture right?         ""So I'm looking forward to the major championship venues next year. They have set up well for me over the years and I look forward to it.""         As for his form at Sherwood Country Club this week Woods was particularly pleased with the success of a new driver he put in his bag while he bemoaned his putting on three of the four days.         ""I drove the ball great this week"" he said. ""I found a nice driver and I'm very pleased at the changes that I found in that. I think changing the shaft really made a big difference there.         ""Most of the week though except for Friday I was struggling with my putting blocking putts. Today was a perfect example of that. I blocked a lot of putts and just had a tough time finding my release point.         ""The last hole you know being left-to-right and I just didn't want to block that one and I didn't. I over released it.""         Woods lipped out with a five-footer to bogey the first extra hole after Johnson had safely two-putted there for par.         ""Putting comes and goes"" said Woods. ""It is what it is. You have your good days and bad days. Friday I made everything. And today was just one of those days where I just didn't make a lot.""

Two shots behind the pacesetting Woods at the start of the day Johnson fell four behind with just eight holes left before making four birdies along with a spectacular wedge hole-out for par at the last to take the tournament into a playoff.         Having twice finished second to tournament host Woods in the elite limited-field event at Sherwood Country Club Johnson reversed that position as he safely parred the first extra hole before Woods surprisingly lipped out from five feet to bogey.         ""You want to end the tournament with someone making a putt"" Johnson said after Woods' miss handed him his second tournament victory of the year. ""You don't want to see it like that especially when he has hit a really good sand shot.""         Woods had dumped his approach into the front right greenside bunker at the par-four 18th before failing to get up and down to extend the playoff.         ""He played great"" Johnson said of the American world number one who had previously won the World Challenge five times. ""He didn't make as many putts as I did. That's all it really was. Today.""         Johnson whose only major victory came at the 2007 Masters is a medium-length hitter renowned for his brilliant short game and never-say-die attitude.         ""I love the competition I love being in difficult situations and having to execute and that sort of thing"" said the 37-year-old American a 10-times winner on the PGA Tour.         ""I like when you get somewhat in contention I like getting after it. I've always liked that. Doesn't matter what sport it is.         ""I know what my talent is and I know my limitations and I feel like I know my game. So if it's good enough that week that day then great. If it's not I'll just keep working.""         What made Sunday's charge down the stretch even more special for Johnson was that he was duelling with 14-time major champion Woods the greatest player of his generation.         ""Everybody talks about going head to head with him"" said Johnson. ""That's what I want as a competitor. I want to play against the best. He's the best I've ever played with and I want to put myself in that position.         ""I've been in it I don't know how many times twice here and a handful of times on Tour. I like playing with him. He's a friend and he seems to bring out the worst and the best in you you know.         ""If I win I win. If I lose I lose. That's kind of the way I approached today. I just like to compete and being in those situations where you get into holes you have to execute you have to hit a shot. I feel very honoured to be the champion.""

She corralled her four children and her husband and they padded rapidly down the stairs coughing shoeless and still in pajamas. From the street they watched their apartment burn and with it their belongings.         Â€ÂœWe lost everythingÂ€Âù Ms. Alvarado now 44 said. Â€ÂœTodito. Every little thing burned.Â€Âù         Ms. Alvarado and her husband Francisco Arias had grown up in small villages in El Salvador Â€Â” known as cantones in Salvadoran Spanish Â€Â” during the countryÂ€Â™s 12-year civil war. Fear was pervasive. Ms. Alvarado hid in cornfields to avoid roving guerrilleros and bullet-spitting helicopters.         During the most violent times Â€Âœwe just had to stay insideÂ€Âù Ms. Alvarado said. Â€ÂœWe were too scared to go out.Â€Âù Ms. Alvarado and Mr. Arias eventually fled El Salvador (they did not know each other then) and came to the United States arriving in New York with nothing.         When Ms. Alvarado came to this country she lived with her brother in Far Rockaway Queens and worked as a housekeeper. She eventually met Mr. Arias a dishwasher three years her junior and the couple had four children together.         Day by day they had pieced together a life. But the 2010 fire in Washington Heights which started in a downstairs laundromat according to Ms. Alvarado snatched them back to the starting point: no belongings no home and facing seemingly insurmountable challenges. Â€ÂœWhen the house was on fire oh I thought about many thingsÂ€Âù Ms. Alvarado said. Â€ÂœThe things our papers the things weÂ€Â™d spent so much to buy. I thought about: Where were we going to go? Because we left without shoes.         Â€ÂœFrom there we went to stay with my sister. She said Â€Â˜If you are O.K. sleeping on the floor you can stay here.Â€Â™ So we stayed.Â€Âù         After four months with Ms. AlvaradoÂ€Â™s sister Â€Â” 15 people in a three-bedroom apartment Â€Â” the family found a place of their own. But the rent was $2000 a month far more than they could afford.         Mr. Arias makes about $1600 a month working at a MortonÂ€Â™s steakhouse and the couple slipped into debt. For two years after the fire they slept on an inflatable mattress and the children slumbered on sofas or on the floor. Â€ÂœEvery night we inflated the bedÂ€Âù Ms. Alvarado said. Â€ÂœThis is no good because I would wake up in pain. I woke up with pain here in the back. And sometimes one wakes on the floor sometimes the bed doesnÂ€Â™t inflate. ItÂ€Â™s very difficult to sleep like this.Â€Âù         In December 2012 a city-subsidized apartment opened up in the West 50s. Rent would be just $213 a month. Ms. Alvarado was ecstatic. But when she saw the place it was gray-walled grime-filled and furniture-less. Â€ÂœAy I said to myself: How are we going to buy things?Â€Âù she recalled.         The ChildrenÂ€Â™s Aid Society a recipient agency of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund offered to help donating $1300 for winter clothing pots pans kitchen utensils a bed and an armoire. Mr. Arias painted the walls in the home a canary yellow.         Â€ÂœThings they have a lot of importanceÂ€Âù Ms. Alvarado said. Â€ÂœYou want to wash to have your own towel to have your clean underwear to change into your bed linens. To have a pretty little apartment with all of your little things.Â€Âù         The family continues to face challenges. Mr. Arias said they are $4000 in debt from the aftermath of the fire. He did not receive compensation for lost belongings and would like to bring a suit against the landlord of the apartment. He has contacted lawyers but they have not been able to help him recuperate funds. Ms. Alvarado is prepared for whatever may come. She still has the inflatable bed she said.         Just in case.        184,1E+14,0,Article,News,Japan Cuts 3Q Economic Growth Estimate to 1.1 Pct,World,265,5.982,5.511,TOKYO Â€Â” Japan slashed its estimate of economic growth for the July-September quarter Monday as investment by companies slowed more than first estimated.         The government said the world's third-largest economy grew an annualized 1.1 percent last quarter less than half the pace of the previous quarter. The initial estimate had put growth at 1.9 percent.         Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic revival strategy for Japan centers on cheap credit a weak yen and longer-term reforms to boost competitiveness but corporate investment and personal incomes have yet to rebound. Meanwhile exports have grown less than expected despite the weaker yen partly due to slowing growth in many emerging economies.         Japan's economy grew at a 4.3 percent pace in the first quarter of the year and 3.8 percent in April-June.         The revised data for the third quarter showed that the economy expanded 0.3 percent from the second quarter. The original estimate was 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter growth.         As the U.S. has moved toward a possible reduction of its monetary easing Japan's central bank has reaffirmed its commitment to pumping money into the economy to achieve an inflation target of 2 percent by 2015. Prices have only just begun to rise but most of the increase has been attributed to rising costs for fuel and other imports.         The revised data Monday showed slower foreign and domestic demand than originally thought.         Private investment excluding residential investment was flat. Economic growth was supported by a 6.5 percent increase year-on-year in public spending reflecting the government's boost in infrastructure investment and stepped up reconstruction in the areas devastated by the March 2011 tsunami.        188,1E+14,0,Article,News,Items From Nancy Drew Author Sold at Ohio Auction,U.S.,444,5.419,5.695,"TOLEDO Ohio Â€Â” Typewriters and a desk from the home of the original author of the Nancy Drew mystery books along with a book detailing how the series was created were auctioned in Ohio on Sunday.         The items were among a lifetime of keepsakes including autographed posters and writing awards belonging to Mildred Wirt Benson that sold at an auction in Toledo where she was a newspaper reporter and columnist for nearly 60 years before her death a decade ago.         Benson wrote more than 130 books including the 1940s Penny Parker mystery series but she is best known for the Nancy Drew books that inspired and captivated generations of girls. She wrote 23 of the 30 original Nancy Drew stories using the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. Paid $125 per book she never collected any royalties.         Benson died in 2002 at 96 and left her home and possessions to her only daughter Peggy Wirt who died in January.         A copy of ""Rediscovering Nancy Drew"" that details how the series was created and was inscribed for her daughter drew a gavel price of $2150 Sunday.         A typewriter went for $825 and a desk for $525. A 10-book set by science-fiction writer Andre Norton who had a personal relationship with Benson was also auctioned. Nine of the 10 books were signed to Benson and the collection along with some letters had a gavel price of $3200.         Auctioneer Jade Montrie who handled the estate sale said a few hundred of Benson's signed and canceled checks went for $900.         A typewriter that Benson used to write the Nancy Drew stories was donated to the Smithsonian Institution years ago. Her daughter left a collection of her mother's books to the University of Iowa which was Benson's alma mater.         Benson was hired in 1930 to write the books based on plot outlines written by Edward Stratemeyer the famed book publisher who also was behind the Bobbsey Twins and Hardy Boys.         Most scholars credit Benson with developing the character of Nancy Drew who wore stylish cardigan sweater sets while climbing through attics and haunted mansions in search of clues and catching jewel thieves and kidnappers.         Dozens of ghost writers followed Benson also writing under the Keene name. Harriet Adams Stratemeyer's daughter took over and directed writers in the 1950s to make the stories shorter and faster-paced. The books are still in publication though the main character has evolved with the times since her debut in 1930.         Benson was bound by an agreement with the publisher not to publicly reveal her identity as the series' original author but it became known in 1980 when she testified in a court case involving Nancy Drew's publisher.        "146,1E+14,0,Article,News,Bruins Topple Maple Leafs 5-2,Sports,779,5.262,5.347,"TORONTO Â€Â” Carl Soderberg and Torey Krug scored second-period power-play goals and the Boston Bruins defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 5-2 on Sunday.         The Bruins were coming off a Saturday night win over Pittsburgh where Shawn Thornton had a takedown of Brooks Orpik. The Bruins were without the suspended Thornton as well as Loui Eriksson and Chris Kelly who were both injured in the game.         The Leafs controlled the play early on and led 1-0 after the first on a goal by Peter Holland.         But the Bruins had a three-goal outburst in the second period including a pair of power-play goals in a 93-second stretch.         Toronto which also gave up two power-play goals in a win against the Senators on Saturday went 0 for 4 on the power play Sunday.         The Bruins outshot the Leafs 40-32.         Jay McClement also scored for Toronto.         Kevan Miller Jarome Iginla and Patrice Bergeron also scored for Boston.         Thornton the Bruins' enforcer is suspended pending a league hearing into an incident that sent Orpik to a hospital.         ""I agree he did cross the line"" Boston coach Claude Julien said of Thornton prior to Sunday's game. ""He got caught in the emotions. There's nobody that's proud of what happened (Saturday) night. Absolutely not. So he's going to suffer the consequences and so will we.""         ""Thorny did cross the line and some others did too"" Julien added. ""But sometimes you have to man up to those things and I think he did.""         Defensemen Adam McQuaid and Johnny Boychuk were sidelined with earlier injuries. The Bruins' defensive issues were intensified Sunday when Dougie Hamilton exited after the first period after a collision with Leafs defenseman Carl Gunnarsson.         The Leafs also missed Tuukka Rask given the night off in favor of Chad Johnson. Jonathan Bernier started for Toronto after James Reimer's 47-save performance in Ottawa.         It took the Leafs almost five minutes to get a shot on the Boston goal but they still showed jump and went ahead at 12:20 when Holland jammed a David Clarkson redirect of a Jake Gardiner shot into a gaping net for his third of the season.         Boston pulled even on the power play at 5:14 of the second period after Reilly Smith found Soderberg alone on the edge of the crease. Toronto's Carter Ashton was in the penalty box for delay of game.         Shortly after the goal the Leafs went a man-down again with Gunnarsson sent to the box. And Krug made the Leafs pay with his eighth goal of the season at 6:47 beating Bernier with the hulking Zdeno Chara blocking the goalie in front.         Ten of the Bruins' 15 power-play goals this season have come from their defensemen.         Boston outshot Toronto 8-0 in the second period before the Leafs put a shot on Johnson at 9:57. Defenseman Cody Franson had a good chance from in close with seven minutes remaining but the Bruins goalie made the save.         Toronto captain Dion Phaneuf and forward Phil Kessel ran into each other on a line change flooring Kessel. It was that kind of period for the Leafs.         Smith hit the Toronto crossbar late in the period. Seconds later Miller's wrist shot from the blue line slipped through Bernier at 15:58. It was his first NHL goal.         Boston outshot Toronto 17-9 in the second period.         McClement closed the gap to 3-2 just 37 seconds into the third winning a faceoff in the Bruins' end and then driving the Boston goal slapping in his own rebound for his first of the season.         The Bruins had to kill off consecutive penalties to maintain their lead. The Leafs needed a save from Bernier on Jordan Caron to stay within one as the clock wound down.         But Bernier couldn't stop Iginla after Milan Lucic accelerated past Phaneuf and passed to Iginla in the crease for his sixth goal at the 16:00 mark.         Miller left the game with 2:17 remaining after being hit in the boards by Phaneuf. And Boston closed out the game killing off the Bergeron penalty while the Leafs pulled their goalie for a sixth attacker.         In the wake of Saturday night's injuries the Bruins summoned forwards Ryan Spooner and Matt Fraser from the AHL's Providence Bruins on an emergency basis.         Mark Fraser and Morgan Rielly sat out Sunday's game opening spots on the blue line for Paul Ranger and John-Michel Liles.         NOTES: Sunday's game was the 326th regular-season game meeting between the Bruins and Leafs in Toronto but just the third on a Sunday. ... The Bruins continue their four-game road trip in Canada against Calgary on Tuesday Edmonton on Thursday and Vancouver on Saturday before returning home to host the Flames on Dec. 17.        "49,1E+14,1,Article,News,"His Honor? Torontoâ€™s Mayor Rampages On, to Cityâ€™s Shame",World,709,5.375,5.459,TORONTO Â€Â” The end did not come for Rob Ford the mayor of this city when he proclaimed his proclivity for oral sex on live television.         It did not come when the police confirmed that they had a video of him smoking crack something he had repeatedly denied nor when he showed up drunk at a local festival careened equally plastered on a dance floor or when the local Santa parade told him to please stay away.         It did not even come Monday during a City Council meeting at which members voted to take away most of his budget and staff while he cantered around the chamber heckling voters and knocking a City Council member to the floor.         It seems that Mr. Ford absent a decision to quit will remain at the helm of CanadaÂ€Â™s largest and most affluent city at least until his term ends next year. He says he has far too many phone calls left to make.         Â€ÂœAre you aware that 2200 people call me?Â€Âù Mr. Ford repeatedly said Monday adding that he also gets 138000 emails a year that require a response by way of explaining why he ought to keep his budget and staff. Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m still doing the job!Â€Âù         Mr. Ford who rode to power in 2010 on a populist wave of suburban rage after 10 years as a city councilor has a long and well-known history of profane intemperate outbursts. But his recent behavior which has mortified many of his constituents has also enhanced his appeal with many of his core voters Â€Â” working-class residents of the unified suburbs the people he calls the Ford Nation.         But in the six months since The Toronto Star and the website Gawker first reported viewing a video of the mayor smoking crack his support has plummeted among the wealthy conservative voters in the cityÂ€Â™s core who once liked his antitax message.         On Monday the Council voted to cut the mayorÂ€Â™s budget by 60 percent leaving him with a skeletal staff. They have also eliminated most of his authority important powers like appointing key city leaders and responding to emergencies leaving him as little more than the face of Toronto the role he nevertheless relishes most. Under local law the Council has no authority to impeach or remove the mayor nor can it hold a recall campaign.         Undaunted Mr. Ford has indicated he will test the CouncilÂ€Â™s unprecedented moves in court. Â€ÂœWhat is happening today is not a democratic processÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s a dictatorship process.Â€Âù         For the lawmakers and people of Toronto known to much of the world as a cosmopolitan city with copious bike lanes hockeyÂ€Â™s Maple Leafs and general placidity the endurance of Mr. Ford so rotund and erratic that he often appears on the brink of spontaneous explosion has become nothing short of an obsession.         Â€ÂœI just had to see this for myselfÂ€Âù said Lynn Murray a retired teacher who sat riveted in the Council chamber as Mr. Ford spoke. Â€ÂœThis place used to be so civilized.Â€Âù         The majority of his fellow Council members wish he would simply go away.         Â€ÂœThis is a real crisisÂ€Âù said Sarah Doucette a Council member. Â€ÂœThe impact on our city is that weÂ€Â™ve become a laughingstock. How can we encourage business to move here?Â€Âù         Ms. Doucette said she gets loads of emails from concerned parents; in the High Park area children have taken to a schoolyard game called Â€ÂœCops and Rob Ford.Â€Âù         Just a decade ago Mr. Ford was a brash if marginal lawmaker from Etobicoke a suburb with a large working-class and immigrant population in the western edge of Toronto one of several small cities that became part of a large-scale Toronto under unification in 1998. Etobicoke and some of the other suburbs have not seen the same explosive economic growth as the old city where real estate arts money and cultural life have flourished. The old Toronto values particularly discouraging the use of cars clashed with those suburbanites.         As a councilor Mr. Ford usually took positions to the right of his conservative peers often on the wrong side of 42-to-2 votes including an annual attempt to eliminate money for the watering of plants at City Hall. Â€ÂœI was astonished when he became mayorÂ€Âù said John Filion the Council member who wrote the measure to strip Mr. Ford of his budget.        35,KTJ493vNbwrrkNI0sY5EkQ,1,Blogs,Blog Post,Dispute Over Gay Marriage Erupts in Cheney Family ,U.S.,4834,5.667,5.52,"Updated, 10:09 p.m. |  â€œ W e   w e r e   a s   c l o s e   a s   s i s t e r s   c a n   b e , â€ù   r e c a l l e d   M a r y   C h e n e y   o f   h e r   r e l a t i o n s h i p   w i t h   h e r   o l d e r   s i s t e r ,   L i z .

The Canucks (17-10-5) earned their fifth win in sixth games and moved within a point of the Avalanche (20-8) in the tight Western Conference standings.         Jean-Sebastien Giguere lost for the first time in eight decisions this season. The Avalanche were beaten for just the third time in nine games.         Ryan Kesler also scored for the Canucks who were outshot 29-21.         Jamie McGinn had the lone goal for Colorado scored with only 7.1 seconds left. That kept Roberto Luongo from earning his 65th NHL shutout. He is 14-8-5 this season.         Giguere's 7-0 start was a career best as a Colorado franchise record.         The Canucks criticized by coach John Tortorella following Friday's overtime win over Phoenix for an ongoing inability to finish out wins broke open a tight game with two goals in the third.         Vancouver shut out on three power plays failed to net a man-advantage goal for the first time in eight games. Colorado had one power play.         The Avalanche outshot the Canucks 12-6 in the first period but Vancouver held a 1-0 lead after 20 minutes.         Santorelli opened the scoring 5:34 in on his club's first shot. He deked Giguere after Chris Higgins intercepted Colorado defenseman Nate Guerin's pass behind the net and sent the puck out front.         The Canucks had chances to increase their lead in the closing seconds of the first but Nick Holden pulled the puck off the goal line. Giguere also stopped Daniel Sedin's backhand and then denied Ryan Stanton on the final shot of the period.         Early in the second Giguere stopped a dangerous chance by Santorelli and Luongo foiled John Mitchell by doing the splits. With just over three minutes left in the second Holden beat Luongo cleanly with a high slap shot but the puck bounced off the crossbar went back down to the ice and was cleared.         Kesler put the Canucks ahead 2-0 at 1:32 of the second period when he tucked in Santorelli's rebound while standing alone beside the net. The goal was Kesler's 15th in 32 games this season putting him seven shy of the 22 he mustered in 77 games in the 2011-12 season.         He has already surpassed the four he scored in an injury-plagued and lockout-shortened 2013 season.         About five minutes later Santorelli beat Giguere with a high shot while using Higgins as a decoy on a 2-on-1 break.         NOTES: The Canucks recalled D Yannick Weber from Utica (AHL). He adds further depth following Alex Edler's undisclosed injury and Tortorella's comment that Andrew Alberts' play ""scares"" him. Edler sat out a second consecutive game. ... This season marks the first since the former Quebec Nordiques franchise relocated to Colorado that the Avalanche and Canucks aren't in the same division.

The FedÂ€Â™s chairman Ben S. Bernanke predicted in June that the Fed would taper its purchases by the end of this year and officials say they still could announce such a cut next week when the FedÂ€Â™s policy-making committee is scheduled to hold its final meeting of the year.         But influential Fed officials see little harm in postponing the decision particularly compared with the risks of pulling back too soon. Significant details of the eventual retreat also remain the subjects of unresolved debates according to the public statements and interviews. And some officials argue that the slow pace of inflation is itself a reason for the Fed to maintain its stimulus campaign.         Â€ÂœEverything else equal I would like to see a couple of months of good numbersÂ€Âù Charles L. Evans president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago  Mr. Evans added that he was Â€Âœcertainly nervousÂ€Âù about the sluggish pace of inflation. Rising prices can  Low inflation reduces those incentives. It also means the economy is closer to deflation or a general decline in prices which has the opposite effect: freezing economic activity by discouraging both borrowing and spending.         Since January the Fed has added $85 billion a month to its holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities as part of a broader campaign to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers and encourage risk-taking by investors.         Mr. Bernanke and his allies have repeatedly described the program as a safe and effective way to generate a little more economic activity at a time when the nationÂ€Â™s primary economic problem is that millions of Americans cannot find jobs.         Almost from the outset however internal and external critics have questioned whether the bond purchases are helping the broader economy or merely enriching investors. And they have warned that the FedÂ€Â™s outsize role in financial markets is disrupting normal activity and may be encouraging excessive speculation.         In the face of those doubts the Fed has appeared to play for time repeatedly indicating that it is getting ready to pull back even as a strong majority of its policy-making committee has voted to extend the campaign at each meeting this year.         William C. Dudley the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a key supporter of the bond purchase program reflected the caution of this majority in  Â€ÂœI hope that this marks a turning point for the economyÂ€Âù Mr. Dudley said. But he continued Â€ÂœWe have seen such bursts in payroll growth before over the past few years and have been disappointed when the pickups proved temporary.Â€Âù         Officials including Mr. Dudley and Janet L. Yellen the FedÂ€Â™s vice chairwoman Â€Â” whom the Senate is likely to confirm as Mr. BernankeÂ€Â™s successor later this month Â€Â” see recent job growth as outstripping the moderate pace of economic growth.         Â€ÂœThe Yellen/Dudley prescription holds that it will take strong  Agreeing on a plan also will take some work. The Fed wants to convince investors that tapering would not alter what it views as the centerpiece of its economic stimulus campaign its commitment to hold short-term interest rates near zero. It has said that it will keep rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent and probably quite a bit longer. The rate in November was 7 percent.        19,1E+14,1,Article,News,"Inside the Race to Rescue a Health Care Site, and Obama",U.S.,704,5.882,5.412,WASHINGTON Â€Â” As a small coterie of grim-faced advisers shuffled into the Oval Office on the evening of Oct. 15 President ObamaÂ€Â™s chief domestic accomplishment was falling apart 24 miles away at a bustling high-tech data center in suburban Virginia.         HealthCare.gov the $630 million online insurance marketplace was a disaster after it went live on Oct. 1 with a roster of engineering repairs that would eventually swell to more than 600 items. The private contractors who built it were pointing fingers at one another. And inside the White House after initially saying too much traffic was to blame Mr. ObamaÂ€Â™s closest confidants had few good answers.         The political dangers were clear to everyone in the room: Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.;  Â€ÂœWe created this problem we didnÂ€Â™t need to createÂ€Âù Mr. Obama said according to one adviser who like several interviewed insisted on anonymity to share details of the private session. Â€ÂœAnd itÂ€Â™s of our own doing and itÂ€Â™s our most important initiative.Â€Âù         Out of that tense Oval Office meeting grew a frantic effort aimed at rescuing not only the insurance portal and Mr. ObamaÂ€Â™s credibility but also the Democratic philosophy that an activist government can solve big complex social problems. Today that rescue effort is far from complete.         The website which the administration promised would Â€Âœfunction smoothlyÂ€Âù for most people by Nov. 30 remains a work in progress. It is more stable with many more people able to use it simultaneously than just two weeks ago. But it still suffers sporadic crashes and large parts of the vital Â€Âœback endÂ€Âù that processes enrollment data and transactions with insurers remain unbuilt. The president who polls showed was now viewed by a majority of Americans  Another round of hardware upgrades and software fixes was planned for Saturday night. Administration officials say they will give a public update about the siteÂ€Â™s performance on Sunday morning.         The story of how the administration confronted one of the most perilous moments in Mr. ObamaÂ€Â™s presidency Â€Â” drawn from documents and from interviews with dozens of administration officials lawmakers insurance executives and tech experts working inside the HealthCare.gov Â€Âœwar roomÂ€Âù Â€Â” reveals an insular White House that did not initially appreciate the magnitude of its self-inflicted wounds and sought help from trusted insiders as it scrambled to protect Mr. ObamaÂ€Â™s image.         After a month of bad publicity and intensifying Republican attacks the sense of crisis and damage control inside the White House peaked on Oct. 30 as the presidentÂ€Â™s top aides began to fully grasp the breadth of the political challenges they faced. As Ms. Sebelius was grilled by Congressional Republicans that day Mr. Obama flew to Boston to defend the health law and confront a  The day was a brutal reminder for top White House advisers that fixing the botched health care rollout would be critical to restoring their bossÂ€Â™s agenda and legacy. To do that they would have to take charge of a project that they would come to discover had never been fully tested and was flailing in part because of the Medicare agencyÂ€Â™s decision not to hire a Â€Âœsystems integratorÂ€Âù that could coordinate its complex parts. The White House would also have to hold together a fragile alliance of Democratic lawmakers and insurance executives.         Â€ÂœIf we donÂ€Â™t do thatÂ€Âù one senior White House adviser recalled Â€ÂœitÂ€Â™s a very serious threat to the success of the legislation and a very serious threat to him. We get that.Â€Âù         The urgent race to fix the website Â€Â” now playing out behind the locked glass doors of the closely guarded war room in Columbia Md. Â€Â” has exposed a deeply dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and Human Services and its technology contractors and tensions between the White House chief of staff and senior health department officials. It strained relations between the Obama administration and the insurance industry helped revive a Republican Party battered after the two-week government shutdown and frustrated even infuriated Congressional Democrats.         But as the presidentÂ€Â™s team gathered on Oct. 15 Â€Â” with a budget deal finally in sight on Capitol Hill Â€Â” his difficulties were only just becoming clear to the White House. As aides left the Oval Office that evening clutching notes filled with what Mr. McDonough called Â€Âœdo-outsÂ€Âù or assignments political pressure was mounting.        61,1E+14,1,Article,News Analysis,Health Law Rolloutâ€™s Stumbles Draw Parallels to Bushâ€™s Hurricane Response,U.S.,681,5.791,5.381,WASHINGTON Â€Â” Barack Obama won the presidency by exploiting a political environment that devoured George W. Bush in a second term plagued by sinking credibility failed legislative battles fractured world relations and revolts inside his own party.         President Obama is now threatened by a similar toxic mix. The disastrous rollout of his health care law not only threatens the rest of his agenda but also raises questions about his competence in the same way that the Bush administrationÂ€Â™s botched response to Hurricane Katrina undermined any semblance of Republican efficiency.         But unlike Mr. Bush who faced confrontational but occasionally cooperative Democrats Mr. Obama is battling a Republican opposition that has refused to open the door to any legislative fixes to the health care law and has blocked him at virtually every turn. A contrite-sounding Mr. Obama repeatedly blamed himself on Thursday for the failed health care rollout which he acknowledged had thrust difficult burdens on his political allies and hurt AmericansÂ€Â™ trust in him.         Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s legitimate for them to expect me to have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole range of these issues in generalÂ€Âù Mr. Obama said. The president did not admit to misleading people about whether they could keep their insurance but again expressed regret that his assurances turned out to be wrong.         Â€ÂœTo those Americans I hear you loud and clearÂ€Âù Mr. Obama said as he announced changes intended to allow some people to keep their insurance.         But earning back the confidence of Americans as he pledged to do will require Mr. Obama to right more than just the health care law. At home his immigration overhaul is headed for indefinite delay and new budget and debt fights loom. Overseas revelations of spying by the National Security Agency have infuriated American allies and negotiations over IranÂ€Â™s nuclear arsenal have set off bipartisan criticism.         For the first time in Mr. ObamaÂ€Â™s presidency surveys suggest that his reserve of good will among the public is running dry. Two polls in recent weeks have reported that a majority of Americans no longer trust the president or believe that he is being honest with them.         Â€ÂœWhen you start losing the trust and confidence not only of Congress but the American people that makes it even more difficultÂ€Âù said Senator Joe Manchin III Democrat of West Virginia. Â€ÂœYou can work yourself out. But you have to be sincere and you have to be honest.Â€Âù         The difficulties have put Mr. Obama on the defensive at exactly the moment he might have seized political advantage in a dysfunctional Washington. If not for the health care disaster the two-week shutdown of the government last month would have been an opportunity for Mr. Obama to sharpen the contrast with Republicans. Democratic lawmakers expressed growing frustration on Thursday with the opportunities the party had missed to hammer home the ideological differences between the two parties. The lawmakers say there is intensifying anxiety within the Democratic caucus that the poor execution of the health care law could bleed into their 2014 re-election campaigns.         Republicans readily made the Hurricane Katrina comparison. Â€ÂœThe echoes to the fall of 2005 are really eerieÂ€Âù said Peter D. Feaver a top national security official in Mr. BushÂ€Â™s second term. Â€ÂœKatrina which is shorthand for bungled administration policy matches to the rollout of the website.Â€Âù Looking back he said Â€Âœwe can see that some of the things that we hoped were temporary or just blips turned out to be more systemic from a political sense. ItÂ€Â™s a fair question of whether thatÂ€Â™s happening to President Obama.Â€Âù         The presidentÂ€Â™s top aides vehemently reject the comparison of Mr. ObamaÂ€Â™s fifth year in office to the latter half of Mr. BushÂ€Â™s second term. They say Americans lost confidence in Mr. Bush because of his administrationÂ€Â™s ineptitude on Hurricane Katrina and its execution of the war in Iraq while Mr. Obama is struggling to extend health care to millions of people who do not have it. Those are very different issues they said.         Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m always very leery of these apocalyptic predictionsÂ€Âù said David Axelrod a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama.        27,1E+14,1,Article,News,U.S. Sends Two B-52 Bombers Into Air Zone Claimed by China,World,768,5.854,5.495,WASHINGTON Â€Â” Defying China two long-range American bombers flew through contested airspace over the East China Sea days after the Chinese announced they were claiming the right to police the sky above a vast area that includes islands at the center of a simmering dispute with Japan.         Pentagon officials said Tuesday that the B-52s were on a routine training mission planned long in advance of the Chinese announcement on Saturday that it was  A senior Pentagon official said that the mission overnight Monday from Guam Â€Âœwas a demonstration of long-established international rights to freedom of navigation and transit through international airspace.Â€Âù The official said the unilateral Chinese declaration of expanded control Â€Âœwas provocativeÂ€Âù and Â€Âœonly increases the risk of miscalculation in the region.Â€Âù         There was no immediate Chinese response to the flights conducted without prior notification as demanded under the new declaration from Beijing which asserted the right to identify monitor and possibly take military action against any aircraft that enter the area. The unexpected announcement by China was among its boldest moves yet in a struggle for power in Asia with the United States and by extension its regional allies including Japan. The United States long the dominant power in the region has been scrambling to shore up its influence there promising in what it called a Â€ÂœpivotÂ€Âù to Asia in 2011 to refocus its energies after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan diverted its time and resources.         Having Japan in the mix only adds volatility. The country has its own tangled history with China which has sped past Japan as an economic power and which retains bitter memories of imperial JapanÂ€Â™s military invasion last century. Under its conservative leader Shinzo Abe Japan has refused to back down in the dispute with China over the uninhabited islands which Japan has long controlled.         For the White House the flare-up could prove a major distraction for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as he embarks on a weeklong tour of China Japan and South Korea. Administration officials are eager to focus on issues like North Korea and an American-led trans-Pacific trade deal meant to bolster economic ties in the region even as China woos its neighbors with aid and investment.         The islands called the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China are currently administered by the Japanese who consider the airspace above the islands to be theirs. American officials have been increasingly worried about the standoff which they fear could lead to conflict. By treaty the United States is obligated to defend Japan if it is attacked.         But both China and AmericaÂ€Â™s Asian allies know that WashingtonÂ€Â™s focus has been elsewhere a reality that became evident when President Obama had to cancel a trip to an Asian summit meeting during the recent American government shutdown.         Pressed on whether the Chinese move represents an overt attempt to fill an American security void in the region Pentagon officials responded by pointing to the American response to the catastrophic typhoon that struck the Philippines this month. The United States quickly moved in hundreds of Marines dozens of transport aircraft and an entire aircraft carrier strike group.  However Mr. Obama is fielding a new national security team with views on Asia that are still coalescing and with relatively little experience in the region.         In her first major speech on Asia policy last week Mr. ObamaÂ€Â™s national security adviser Susan E. Rice did not mention the mutual defense clause in the treaty between the United States and Japan Â€Â” an omission her colleagues dismissed as irrelevant since American officials reiterate it religiously but which troubled some in Japan.         But Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel wasted no time in responding to the initial Chinese declaration issuing a statement on Saturday reiterating that the United States was Â€Âœsteadfast in our commitments to our allies and partners.Â€Âù He also repeated that the mutual defense treaty with Japan applies to the disputed islands.         American officials said Tuesday that the United States military would continue to stage a standard cycle of training flights over the East China Sea. The flight by the bombers was first reported Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal.         The move by China on Saturday appeared to be another step in its efforts to intensify pressure on Japan over the contested islands. In the past year Chinese paramilitary ships have made almost daily incursions into the waters around the islands including waters claimed by Japan. The incursions have led to a constant game of cat-and-mouse on the high seas in which the Japanese Coast Guard pursues the Chinese ships with both sides using bullhorns and electronic sign boards to tell the other to stay out of its territorial waters.        42,1E+14,0,Article,News,"So Far, So Good for John Kerry",U.S.,669,5.716,5.661,WASHINGTON Â€Â” Despite a successful political career that includes six statewide election victories in Massachusetts capturing the Democratic presidential nomination and coming within a hair of winning the White House  These traits however arenÂ€Â™t inhibiting an auspicious start as a diplomat.

Â€ÂœHe has thought about this territory energetically and creatively for a long time.Â€Âù         There are caveats. Mr. KerryÂ€Â™s habit of putting his foot in his mouth hasnÂ€Â™t vanished. He hailed a deal with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan that hasnÂ€Â™t materialized; his rhetoric on Syria was all over the lot; and he misspoke about leaders of EgyptÂ€Â™s military coup.         It remains an open question whether the White House will try to rein him in. Associates say Mr. Kerry and President Obama respect each other though accounts that they forged a close bond when Mr. Kerry helped prepare Mr. Obama for the debates against Mitt Romney during the last presidential campaign are exaggerated.         But this White House more than any since Richard NixonÂ€Â™s clings to power and authority. Even Mrs. Clinton despite her political standing was kept on a bit of a leash.         And Susan E. Rice the national security adviser wanted to be secretary of state but removed herself from contention with her comments on the killing of United States diplomats in Libya. She and Mr. Kerry share lunch periodically; the relationship at best is correct. A National Security Council review of Middle East policy didnÂ€Â™t include the State Department and the White House has imposed a number of top State Department officials.         Restraints or not Mr. Kerry is a diplomatic risk-taker; the White House was delighted to give him the Israeli-Palestinian account which was viewed as doomed. Progress has been minimal but Mr. Kerry is relentless.         He is a lead figure in the tentative pact with Iran and will be central in selling the Iranians and Congress on any final deal. Much of his tenure has been consumed by the Middle East. An Asia trip is slated for this week that will include a stop in Vietnam. Mr. Kerry fought there in the 1960s and in the 1980s and Â€Â™90s he led the move toward United States reconciliation with the Southeast Asian nation.         He doesnÂ€Â™t engender much good will in the State Department. This is left to Bill Burns a deputy secretary and veteran diplomat; their relationship by all accounts is a good one. Reportedly it was Mr. Burns who persuaded the secretary to tap a respected envoy Martin Indyk to work on the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.         Top White House aides still occasionally roll their eyes at the mention of Mr. Kerry though there is also a grudging respect now. Mr. Shultz says the key to Mr. KerryÂ€Â™s success will be his relationship with the president: Â€ÂœThey werenÂ€Â™t on the same page on Syria and that was embarrassing.

While the United States continued to defy China by sending military planes into the zone unannounced administration officials said they had made the decision to urge civilian planes to adhere to BeijingÂ€Â™s new rules in part because they worried about an unintended confrontation.         Although the officials made clear that the administration rejects ChinaÂ€Â™s unilateral declaration of control of the airspace over a large area of the East China Sea the guidance to the airlines could be interpreted in the region as a concession in the battle of wills with China.         Â€ÂœThe U.S. government generally expects that U.S. carriers operating internationally will operate consistent withÂ€Âù notice requirements Â€Âœissued by foreign countriesÂ€Âù the State Department said in  The decision contrasted with that of JapanÂ€Â™s government this week when it asked several Japanese airlines which were voluntarily following ChinaÂ€Â™s rules to stop apparently out of fear that complying with the rules would add legitimacy to Chinese claims to islands that sit below the now contested airspace. ChinaÂ€Â™s newly declared zone experts say is intended mainly to whittle away at JapanÂ€Â™s hold on the islands which it has long administered.         On Saturday a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said Â€ÂœWe will not comment on what other countries are doing with regard to filing flight plans.Â€Âù It was not immediately clear if the Obama administration had notified Japan a close ally of its decision.         An official at JapanÂ€Â™s Transport Ministry said it had no immediate change to its advice to Japanese airlines.         The American decision drew criticism from some quarters. Stephen Yates a former Asia adviser to Dick Cheney when he was vice president said it was Â€Âœa bad moveÂ€Âù that would undercut allies in the region that take a different stance.         But Strobe Talbott a former deputy secretary of state under Bill Clinton and now president of the Brookings Institution said it was important to avoid an accident while drawing a firm line. Â€ÂœThe principal option is to be extremely clear that disputesÂ€Âù over territory Â€Âœmust be resolved through diplomacy and not unilateral actionÂ€Âù he said.         American officials said they began having talks with airlines on Wednesday and characterized the guidance Friday as simply following established international air protocols independent of any political deliberations. The American announcement came on the same day that Chinese state news media said that China sent jets aloft and that they identified two American surveillance planes and 10 Japanese aircraft in the air defense zone the country declared last weekend.         Although there was no indication that ChinaÂ€Â™s air force showed any hostile intent the move raised tensions. The Chinese had also sent jets on patrol into the contested airspace the day before but Xinhua the state-run news agency indicated that the planes on Friday were scrambled specifically to respond to foreign jets in the area.         Earlier in the week the United States sent unarmed B-52s into the area and they proceeded unimpeded. China then appeared to back down somewhat from its initial declaration that planes must file advance flight plans or face possible military action.         The administrationÂ€Â™s decision on Friday underscored the delicate position President Obama finds himself in drawn into a geopolitical dispute that will test how far he is willing to go to contain ChinaÂ€Â™s rising regional ambitions.         ChinaÂ€Â™s move thrust the United States into the middle of the already prickly territorial clash between Beijing and Tokyo a position the administration had avoided for months even while reiterating that the mutual defense treaty with Japan covers the islands. After the Chinese declaration last weekend American officials feared that if left unchallenged the Chinese action would lead to ever greater claims elsewhere in the Pacific region.        35,1E+14,0,Article,News,"On Health Exchanges, Premiums May Be Low, but Other Costs Can Be High",U.S.,1092,5.832,5.673,WASHINGTON Â€Â” For months the Obama administration has heralded the low premiums of medical insurance policies on sale in the insurance exchanges created by the new health law. But as consumers dig into the details they are finding that the deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs are often much higher than what is typical in employer-sponsored health plans.         Until now it was almost impossible for people using the federal health care website to see the deductible amounts which consumers pay before coverage kicks in. But federal officials finally relented last week and added a Â€Âœwindow shoppingÂ€Âù feature that displays data on deductibles.         For policies offered in the federal exchange as in many states the annual deductible often tops $5000 for an individual and $10000 for a couple.         Insurers devised the new policies on the assumption that consumers would pick a plan based mainly on price as reflected in the premium. But insurance plans with lower premiums generally have higher deductibles.         In El Paso Tex. for example for a husband and wife both age 35 one of the cheapest plans on the federal exchange offered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield has a premium less than $300 a month but the annual deductible is more than $12000. For a 45-year-old couple seeking insurance on the federal exchange in Saginaw Mich. a policy with a premium of $515 a month has a deductible of $10000.         In Santa Cruz Calif. where the exchange is run by the state Robert Aaron a self-employed 56-year-old engineer said he was looking for a low-cost plan. The best one he could find had a premium of $488 a month. But the annual deductible was $5000 and that he said Â€Âœsounds really high.Â€Âù         By contrast according to the Kaiser Family Foundation the average deductible in employer-sponsored health plans is $1135.         Â€ÂœDeductibles for many plans in the insurance exchanges are pretty highÂ€Âù said Stan Dorn a health policy expert at the Urban Institute. Â€ÂœThese plans are more generous than whatÂ€Â™s prevalent in the current individual insurance market but significantly less generous than most employer-sponsored insurance.Â€Âù         Caroline F. Pearson a vice president of Avalere Health a consulting company that has analyzed hundreds of plans said: Â€ÂœThe premiums are lower than expected but consumers on the exchange will often face high deductibles and high co-payments for medical services and prescription drugs before they reach the cap on out-of-pocket costsÂ€Âù $6350 for an individual and $12700 for a family.         Those limits provide significant protection even though those sums are substantial for most consumers. In addition the federal website HealthCare.gov informs people that they may qualify for subsidies to reduce their out-of-pocket costs if their household income is below 250 percent of the federal poverty level meaning that it is less than $28725 for an individual or $48825 for a family of three.         These Â€Âœcost-sharing reductionsÂ€Âù are available for a specific kind of midlevel plan known as a silver plan. People with lower incomes can get more help with out-of-pocket costs but only if they choose silver plans.         Mr. Dorn said the government had not done much to inform people of these potential savings. Â€ÂœConsumers are giving up cost-sharing reductions of enormous value if they enroll in a bronze plan because it has the lowest premiumÂ€Âù he said.         Plans in the marketplace are separated into four categories Â€Â” bronze silver gold and platinum Â€Â” indicating the generosity of coverage or the share of costs paid by insurance for an average enrollee.         Many people buying insurance on the federal and state exchanges are expected to qualify for subsidies. But in the first month for reasons that are not clear only 30 percent qualified. The others must pay the full premium and will be subject to the full deductible.         Most people shopping in the exchanges are expected to choose bronze or silver plans which provide less generous coverage than most employer-sponsored plans.        32,1E+14,0,Article,News,Eastern States Press Midwest to Improve Air,U.S.,1278,5.636,5.288,WASHINGTON Â€Â” In a battle that pits the East Coast against the Midwest over the winds that carry dirty air from coal plants the governors of eight Northeastern states plan to petition the  The East Coast states including New York and Connecticut have for more than 15 years been subject to stricter air pollution requirements than many other parts of the country. Their governors have long criticized the Appalachian and Rust Belt states including Ohio Kentucky and Michigan for their more lenient rules on pollution from coal-fired power plants factories and tailpipes Â€Â” allowing those economies to profit from cheap energy while their belched soot and smog are carried on the prevailing winds that blow across the United States.         All the governors on the petition are Democrats. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey a Republican and a potential presidential candidate in 2016 has not signed it.         The petition comes the day before the Supreme Court is to hear arguments to determine the fate of a related E.P.A. regulation known as the Â€Âœgood neighborÂ€Âù rule. The regulation officially called the  Even if the regulation is upheld the Eastern governors are seeking stronger constraints on pollution from the Midwest and Rust Belt states.         The Obama administration issued the Â€Âœgood neighborÂ€Âù rule which would apply chiefly to power plants in 27 states east of Nebraska half of the country in 2011 but the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  In the case before the Supreme Court the E.P.A. argues that the cross-state air rule which it is required to issue under the Clean Air Act of 1990 is necessary to protect the health and environment of downwind states. The utilities and 15 states on the other side argue that the rule as written by the Obama administration E.P.A. gives the agency too much regulatory authority and places an unfair economic burden on the states.         The Supreme Court is allowing 90 minutes to listen to arguments rather than the traditional 60 minutes signaling that the justices have a particularly keen interest in the case.         Like the petition from the Northeastern governors the court case reflects the growing anger of East Coast officials against the Appalachian states that mine coal and the Rust Belt states that burn it to fuel their power plants and factories. Coal emissions are the chief cause of global warming and are linked to many health risks including asthma and lung disease.         Gov.  Â€ÂœI care about this because itÂ€Â™s put Connecticut at an economic disadvantageÂ€Âù Mr. Malloy said in an interview. Â€ÂœWeÂ€Â™re paying a lot of money to remove these compounds from the air. That money is reflected in higher energy costs. WeÂ€Â™re more than willing to pay that but the states weÂ€Â™re petitioning should have to follow the same rules.Â€Âù         Mr. Malloy said that more than half the pollution in Connecticut was from outside the state and that it was lowering the life expectancy of Connecticut residents with heart disease or asthma. Â€ÂœTheyÂ€Â™re getting away with murderÂ€Âù Mr. Malloy said of the Rust Belt and Appalachia. Â€ÂœOnly itÂ€Â™s in our state not theirs.Â€Âù         Judging by history environmental advocates said the governorsÂ€Â™ petition had a good chance of success. In 2000 for example the E.P.A. granted petitions from Connecticut Massachusetts New York and Pennsylvania to require 12 states including Ohio and Indiana to control nitrogen emissions from nearly 400 large coal- and gas-fired power plants.         In the last three years Republicans and the coal industry have campaigned aggressively against the E.P.A. regulations as they have accused Mr. Obama of waging a Â€Âœwar on coal.Â€Âù         Across the Midwest many lawmakers see the regulations as a serious economic threat. Representative Fred Upton the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee has said that the cross-state air rule will force families to face Â€Âœthe threat of higher power bills less reliability and job losses.Â€Âù        3,1E+14,1,Article,News,A Russian GPS Using U.S. Soil Stirs Spy Fears,World,557,6.036,5.52,WASHINGTON Â€Â” In the view of AmericaÂ€Â™s spy services the next potential threat from  Instead this menace may come in the form of a seemingly innocuous dome-topped antenna perched atop an electronics-packed building surrounded by a security fence somewhere in the United States.         In recent months the  They fear that these structures could help Russia spy on the United States and improve the precision of Russian weaponry the officials said. These monitor stations the Russians contend would significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of MoscowÂ€Â™s version of the Global Positioning System the American satellite network that steers guided missiles to their targets and thirsty smartphone users to the nearest Starbucks.         Â€ÂœThey donÂ€Â™t want to be reliant on the American system and believe that their systems like GPS will spawn other industries and applicationsÂ€Âù said a former senior official in the State DepartmentÂ€Â™s Office of Space and Advanced Technology. Â€ÂœThey feel as though they are losing a technological edge to us in an important market. Look at everything GPS has done on things like your phone and the movement of planes and ships.Â€Âù         The Russian effort is part of a larger global race by several countries Â€Â” including China and European Union nations Â€Â” to perfect their own global positioning systems and challenge the dominance of the American GPS.         For the State Department permitting Russia to build the stations would help mend the Obama administrationÂ€Â™s relationship with the government of President Vladimir V. Putin now at a nadir because of MoscowÂ€Â™s granting asylum to Mr. Snowden and its backing of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.         But the C.I.A. and other American spy agencies as well as the Pentagon suspect that the monitor stations would give the Russians a foothold on American territory that would sharpen the accuracy of MoscowÂ€Â™s satellite-steered weapons. The stations they believe could also give the Russians an opening to snoop on the United States within its borders.         The squabble is serious enough that administration officials have delayed a final decision until the Russians provide more information and until the American agencies sort out their differences State Department and White House officials said.         RussiaÂ€Â™s efforts have also stirred concerns on Capitol Hill where members of the intelligence and armed services committees view MoscowÂ€Â™s global positioning network Â€Â” known as Glonass for Global Navigation Satellite System Â€Â” with deep suspicion and are demanding answers from the administration.         Â€ÂœI would like to understand why the United States would be interested in enabling a GPS competitor like Russian Glonass when the worldÂ€Â™s reliance on GPS is a clear advantage to the United States on multiple levelsÂ€Âù said Representative Mike D. Rogers Republican of Alabama the chairman of a House Armed Services subcommittee.         Mr. Rogers last week asked the Pentagon to provide an assessment of the proposalÂ€Â™s impact on national security. The request was made in a letter sent to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel Secretary of State John Kerry and the director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr.         The monitor stations have been a high priority of Mr. Putin for several years as a means to improve Glonass not only to benefit the Russian military and civilian sectors but also to compete globally with GPS.         Earlier this year Russia positioned a station in Brazil and agreements with Spain Indonesia and Australia are expected soon according to Russian news reports. The United States has stations around the world but none in Russia.        74,1E+14,0,Article,News,Capital Salutes 5 Stars With Kennedy Center Honors,U.S.,570,5.389,5.877,WASHINGTON Â€Â” Justice Sonia Sotomayor was 15 when Carlos Santana gave his renowned performance at Woodstock Â€Â” one that would help catapult his music career eventually taking him to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 and now to the White House and the State Department as a Kennedy Center honoree.

That is true. As long as their constituents have access to Â€Âœin-person support sessionsÂ€Âù like the ones being conducted at the Capitol and congressional office buildings by the local exchange and four major insurers. Or can log on to a special Blue Cross and Blue Shield website for members of Congress and use a special toll-free telephone number Â€Â” a Â€Âœdedicated congressional health insurance plan assistance line.Â€Âù         And then there is the fact that lawmakers have a larger menu of Â€Âœgold planÂ€Âù insurance choices than most of their constituents have back home.         While millions of Americans have been left to fend for themselves and go through the frustrating experience of trying to navigate the federal exchange members of Congress and their aides have all sorts of assistance to help them sort through their options and enroll.         Lawmakers and the employees who work in their Â€Âœofficial officesÂ€Âù will receive coverage next year through the small-business marketplace of the local insurance exchange known as D.C. Health Link which has staff members close at hand for guidance.         Â€ÂœD.C. Health Link set up shop right here in CongressÂ€Âù said Eleanor Holmes Norton the delegate to the House from the nationÂ€Â™s capital.         Insurers routinely offer Â€Âœmember servicesÂ€Âù to enrollees. But on Capitol Hill the phrase has special meaning indicating concierge-type services for members of Congress.         If lawmakers have questions about Aetna plan benefits and provider networks they can call a special phone number that provides Â€Âœmember services for members of Congress and staff.Â€Âù         On the website run by the Obama administration for 36 states it is notoriously difficult to see the prices deductibles and other details of health plans.         It is much easier for members of Congress and their aides to see and compare their options on websites run by the Senate the House and the local exchange.         Lawmakers can select from 112 options offered in the Â€Âœgold tierÂ€Âù of the District of Columbia exchange far more than are available to most of their constituents.         Aetna is offering eight plan options to members of Congress and Blue Cross and Blue Shield is offering 16. Eight are available from Kaiser Permanente and 80 are on sale from the UnitedHealth Group.         Lawmakers and their aides are not eligible for tax credit subsidies but the government pays up to 75 percent of their premiums contributing a maximum of $5114 a year for individual coverage and $11378 for family coverage. The government contribution is based on the same formula used for most other federal employees.         In debates leading up to passage of the Affordable Care Act members of both parties suggested that all Americans should have coverage as good as what Congress had. President Obama said in 2009 that people should be able to buy insurance in a marketplace or exchange Â€Âœthe same way that federal employees do same way that members of Congress do.Â€Âù         For decades members of Congress have received coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. They generally like their coverage but Â€Â” like millions of Americans facing the loss of their policies next year Â€Â” they cannot keep it.         In the past if lawmakers did nothing in the open enrollment period their coverage would automatically continue. This year by contrast they must affirmatively pick a plan. Their coverage under the federal employee program will end on Dec. 31. If they do not choose a plan via D.C. Health Link by Dec. 9 they will lose the government contribution to their premiums and could lose their right to retiree health benefits as well.         In addition lawmakers who go without insurance next year may like other Americans be subject to tax penalties.        80,1E+14,1,Article,News,The Gayest Place in America?,Fashion & Style,707,5.479,5.531,WASHINGTON Â€Â” My earliest sense of what it meant to be gay in the nationÂ€Â™s capital came more than a decade ago when I was a summer intern. I was a few blocks from Union Station when a congressman walked by and gave the reporters I was standing with a big floppy wave hello.         Â€ÂœYou know what they say about  I didnÂ€Â™t know in fact. I wasnÂ€Â™t even sure what the congressmanÂ€Â™s name was. But the message was as clear as it was unsettling for a 20-year-old struggling with his own sexual identity: There were plenty of gay people in Washington even at the highest levels of government. But instead of being widely accepted they were usually whispered about derisively suspect characters to be mocked and maligned.         Today having moved here 10 months ago after six and a half years of living in Manhattan I hardly recognize that closeted often intolerant Washington I first glimpsed as a 20-year-old. I now live in the gayest place in America.         But donÂ€Â™t take my word for it. Consider what surveys by Gallup and the Census Bureau have found about the gay population here.

The mood was grim.         The prime contractor CGI Federal had long before concluded that the administration was blindly enamored of an unrealistic goal: creating a cutting-edge website that would use the latest technologies to dazzle consumers with its many features. Knowing how long it would take to complete and test the software the companyÂ€Â™s officials and other vendors  Government officials on the other hand insisted that Oct. 1 was not negotiable. And they were fed up with what they saw as CGIÂ€Â™s pattern of excuses for missed deadlines. Michelle Snyder the agencyÂ€Â™s chief operating officer was telling colleagues outright Â€ÂœIf we could fire them we would.Â€Âù         Interviews with current and former Obama administration officials and specialists involved in the project as well as a review of hundreds of pages of government and contractor documents offer new details into how tensions between the government and its contractors questionable decisions and weak leadership within the  The online exchange was crippled people involved with building it said in recent interviews because of a huge gap between the administrationÂ€Â™s grand hopes and the practicalities of building a website that could function on opening day.         Vital components were never secured including sufficient access to a data center to prevent the website from crashing. A backup system that could go live if it did crash was not created a weakness the administration has never disclosed. And the architecture of the system that interacts with the data center where information is stored is so poorly configured that it must be redesigned a process that experts said typically takes months. An initial assessment identified more than 600 hardware and software defects Â€Â” Â€Âœthe longest list anybody had ever seenÂ€Âù one person involved with the project said.         When the realization of impending disaster finally hit government officials at the Aug. 27 meeting Â€Â” just 34 days before the site went live Â€Â” they threw out nearly 30 requirements including the Spanish-language version of the site and a payment system for insurers to receive government subsidies for the policies they sold.         Even then the system  The acrimony between the Medicare agency and CGI had built steadily over the preceding months the new interviews show. By late summer teams of agency officials had parked themselves in CGI FederalÂ€Â™s headquarters in Herndon Va. demanding on-the-spot reviews and demonstrations of new code that was never tested. Agency officials complained that CGI missed crucial deadlines and that it could not control other contractors although the company said it had no power to do so.         CGI and other contractors complained of endlessly shifting requirements and a government decision-making process so cumbersome that it took weeks to resolve elementary questions such as determining whether users should be required to provide  Â€ÂœCut corners make dateÂ€Âù said one specialist who like most of the people interviewed for this article would not allow his name to be used because the Obama administration has requested that all government officials and contractors involved keep their work confidential.         Another sore point was the Medicare agencyÂ€Â™s decision to use database software from a company called MarkLogic that managed the data differently from systems by companies like IBM Microsoft and Oracle. CGI officials argued that it would slow work because it was too unfamiliar. Government officials disagreed and its configuration remains a serious problem.         Thanks to a huge effort to fix the most obvious weaknesses and the appointment at last of a single contractor QSSI to oversee the work the website now crashes much less frequently officials said. That is a major improvement from a month ago when it was up only 42 percent of the time and 10-hour failures were common. Yet an enormous amount of work remains to be done all sides agree.         In a statement on Friday the Medicare agency said officials held hundreds of meetings in the month before the start-up and tried their best to manage a highly complex project in a short time. Â€ÂœThere were issues in meeting deliverables in a timely fashionÂ€Âù the statement said. Â€ÂœWe expected there would be issues. However we did not anticipate the degree of the problems in the system.Â€Âù         One computer expert with intimate knowledge of the project said Â€ÂœLiterally everyone involved was at fault.Â€Âù        74,1E+14,1,Article,News,Obama Moves to Avert Cancellation of Insurance,U.S.,615,5.932,5.469,WASHINGTON Â€Â” President Obama trying to quell a growing furor over the rollout of his health care law bowed to bipartisan pressure on Thursday and announced a policy reversal that would allow insurance companies to temporarily keep people on health plans that were to be canceled under the new law because they did not meet minimum standards.         The decision to allow the policies to remain in effect for a year without penalties represented the Obama administrationÂ€Â™s hurriedly developed effort to address one of the major complaints about the beleaguered health care law. It seemed for the moment to calm rising anger and fear of a political backlash among congressional Democrats who had been threatening to support various legislative solutions opposed by the White House because of their potential to undermine the law.         Senate Democratic leaders said they did not see the need for an immediate legislative fix Â€Â” a victory for White House officials worried that momentum was building toward consideration of a measure to force the change.         The Republican-controlled House is still set to vote Friday on a bill by Representative Fred Upton Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee that would allow Americans to keep their existing health coverage through 2014 without penalties Â€Â” as well as allow new people to continue to buy the plans something the White House said would gut the Affordable Care Act.         The presidentÂ€Â™s announcement on Thursday seemed to limit Democratic defections with only two dozen or so House Democrats now expected to support Mr. UptonÂ€Â™s bill. Without the presidential action officials said scores of Democrats might have joined Republicans in approving the Upton measure.         It remained unclear however just how much impact the fix delivered by an apologetic Mr. Obama would actually have. Though his proposal grants discretion to insurers to allow people to stay on their existing plans there is no guarantee that insurers will do so or that the states will allow such renewals.         Also unclear are what prices will be charged by insurers for existing policies that are continued in force through 2014. Insurers generally did not have rates approved for the renewal of such coverage because the policies were supposed to be terminated at the end of this year.         Some state insurance commissioners caught off-guard by the announcement said they did not intend to allow insurers to reinstate the policies. And insurance companies denounced the presidentÂ€Â™s action.         Â€ÂœChanging the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumersÂ€Âù said Karen M. Ignagni the president of AmericaÂ€Â™s Health Insurance Plans a trade group.         Â€ÂœPremiums have already been set for next year based on an assumption about when consumers will be transitioning to the new marketplaceÂ€Âù she said. Â€ÂœIf now fewer younger and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange premiums will increase and there will be fewer choices for consumers.Â€Âù         The National Association of Insurance Commissioners representing state officials and the American Academy of Actuaries a nonpartisan professional group said the move could threaten the viability of insurance markets operating under rules that provide consumers with new protections starting in 2014.         Republicans portrayed the policy switch as an effort to shift blame to insurance companies. Speaker John A. Boehner dismissed the presidentÂ€Â™s act and said the White House could not be trusted on the issue.         Â€ÂœPromise after promise from this administration has turned out to be not trueÂ€Âù Mr. Boehner said. Â€ÂœSo when it comes to this health care law the White House doesnÂ€Â™t have much credibility. Now letÂ€Â™s be clear. The only way to fully protect the American people is to scrap this law once and for all. There is no way to fix this.Â€Âù        8,1E+14,1,Article,News Analysis,Partisan Fever in Senate Likely to Rise,U.S.,691,5.892,5.437,WASHINGTON Â€Â” President Obama will get a short-term lift for his nominees judicial and otherwise but over the immediate horizon the strong-arm move by Senate Democrats on Thursday to limit filibusters could usher in an era of rank partisan warfare beyond even what Americans have seen in the past five years.         Ultimately a small group of centrists Â€Â” Republicans and Democrats Â€Â” could find the muscle to hold the Senate at bay until bipartisan solutions can be found. But for the foreseeable future Republicans wounded and eager to show they have not been stripped of all power are far more likely to unify against the Democrats who humiliated them in such dramatic fashion.         Â€ÂœThis is the most important and most dangerous restructuring of Senate rules since Thomas Jefferson wrote them at the beginning of our countryÂ€Âù declared Senator Lamar Alexander Republican of Tennessee. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s another raw exercise of political power to permit the majority to do whatever it wants whenever it wants to do it.Â€Âù         The decision to press the button on the so-called nuclear option was no doubt cathartic for a Democratic majority driven to distraction by Republican obstructionism. President Obama had predicted his re-election would break the partisan fever gripping Washington especially since the Tea Party movement swept Republicans to control of the House. It did not.         Â€ÂœDoing nothing was no longer an optionÂ€Âù said Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico one of a new breed of Democrats who have pressed to reform Senate rules.         But the fever is hardly gone. The rule change lowered to a simple 51-vote majority the threshold to clear procedural hurdles on the way to the confirmation of judges and executive nominees. But it did nothing to streamline the gantlet that presidential nominees run. Republicans may not be able to muster the votes to block Democrats on procedure but they can force every nomination into days of debate between every procedural vote in the Senate book Â€Â” of which there will be many.         And legislation at least for now is still very much subject to the filibuster. On Thursday afternoon as one Republican after another went to the Senate floor to lament the end of one type of filibuster they voted against cutting off debate on the annual defense policy bill a measure that has passed with bipartisan support every year for decades.         Â€ÂœTodayÂ€Â™s historic change to Senate rules escalates what is already a hyperpartisan atmosphere in Washington which is already preventing Congress from addressing our nationÂ€Â™s most significant challengesÂ€Âù said former Senator Olympia Snowe a Republican and former Representative Dan Glickman a Democrat in a joint statement from the Bipartisan Policy Center.         Republican senators who were willing to team with Democrats on legislation like an immigration overhaul farm policy and a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act will probably think twice in the future.         Â€ÂœWeÂ€Â™ll have to see but I think it was certainly unfortunateÂ€Âù said Senator Susan Collins a Maine Republican who has often worked with Democrats.         Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the Republican leader made clear that he hoped to exact the ultimate revenge taking back control of the Senate and using the new rules against the Democrats who made them. Â€ÂœThe solution to this problem is at the ballot boxÂ€Âù he said. Â€ÂœWe look forward to having a great election.Â€Âù         David Axelrod a former top adviser to Mr. Obama said retaliation by Republicans against the presidentÂ€Â™s broader agenda would end up hurting them more than Democrats. Â€ÂœIf their answer is Â€Â˜Oh yeah we can make it even worseÂ€Â™ I think they do that at great riskÂ€Âù Mr. Axelrod said. Â€ÂœThey have to make a decision about whether they want to be a shrinking shrieking blocking party or if they are going to be a national party.Â€Âù         From the moment Mr. Obama took office the president who proclaimed that there was no red America and blue America only the United States of America has strained to maintain some pretense of bipartisanship Â€Â” through protracted and fruitless efforts to woo Republicans on his economic stimulus plan and health care law through dinner dates with some handpicked Republican Â€ÂœfriendsÂ€Âù through the nomination of Chuck Hagel a former Republican senator to lead the Defense Department.        94,1E+14,1,Article,News,C.I.A.

Another while not acknowledging the program suggested that the surveillance court had imposed rules withholding the identities of any Americans from the data the C.I.A. sees requiring a tie to a terrorist organization before a search may be run and mandating that the data be discarded after a certain number of years. The court has imposed several similar rules on the N.S.A. call logs program.         Several officials also said more than one other bulk collection program has yet to come to light.         Â€ÂœThe intelligence community collects bulk data in a number of different ways under multiple authoritiesÂ€Âù one intelligence official said.         Dean Boyd a spokesman for the C.I.A. declined to confirm whether such a program exists but said that the agency conducts lawful intelligence collection aimed at foreign Â€Â” not domestic Â€Â” activities and that it is subject to extensive oversight.         Â€ÂœThe C.I.A. protects the nation and upholds the privacy rights of Americans by ensuring that its intelligence collection activities are focused on acquiring foreign intelligence and counterintelligence in accordance with U.S. lawsÂ€Âù he said.         Juan Zarate a White House and Treasury official under President George W. Bush said that unlike telecommunications information there has generally been less sensitivity about the collection of financial data in part because the government already collects information on large transactions under the Bank Secrecy Act.         Â€ÂœThere is a longstanding legal baseline for the U.S. government to collect financial informationÂ€Âù said Mr. Zarate who is also the author of Â€ÂœTreasuryÂ€Â™s WarÂ€Âù about the crackdown on terrorist financing. He did not acknowledge the C.I.A. program.         Orders for business records from the surveillance court generally prohibit recipients from talking about them. A spokeswoman for one large company that handles money transfers abroad Western Union did not directly address a question about whether it had been ordered to turn over records in bulk but said that the company complies with legal requirements to provide information.         Â€ÂœWe collect consumer information to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and other lawsÂ€Âù said the spokeswoman Luella Chavez DÂ€Â™Angelo. Â€ÂœIn doing so we also protect our consumersÂ€Â™ privacy.Â€Âù         In recent months there have been hints in congressional testimony declassified documents and litigation that the N.S.A. program Â€Â” which was disclosed by Edward J. Snowden a former N.S.A. contractor Â€Â” is not unique in collecting records involving Americans.         For example the American Civil Liberties Union is fighting a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit for documents related to Section 215 of the Patriot Act the provision that allows the government to compel companies to turn over business records for counterterrorism purposes. After the government declassified the N.S.A. phone records program it has released many documents about it in response to the suit.         But the government has notified the A.C.L.U. that it is withholding two Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court rulings invoking Section 215 Â€Â” one dated Aug. 20 2008 and the other Nov. 23 2010 Â€Â” because they discuss matters that remain classified according to Alexander Abdo an A.C.L.U. lawyer. Â€ÂœIt suggests very strongly that there are other programs of surveillance that the public has a right to know aboutÂ€Âù Mr. Abdo said.        101,1E+14,1,Article,News,Postal Service to Make Sunday Deliveries for Amazon,Business Day,654,5.678,5.691,WASHINGTON Â€Â” The cash-short United States Postal Service which has failed to win congressional approval to stop delivering mail on Saturdays to save money has struck a deal with the online retailer  For the Postal Service which  The deal announced on Sunday and taking effect immediately in time for the holiday shopping season gives the Postal Service a chance to take some business from United Parcel Service and FedEx which do not deliver on Sundays. Now some orders that would have been handled by either of those carriers for Monday delivery will go through the Postal Service and arrive on Sunday.         The Postal Service said it expected to make more such deals with other merchants seeking a larger role in the $186 billion e-commerce market. Amazon.com would not say if it would try to arrange Sunday deliveries with other parcel carriers.         For this holiday shopping season Sunday delivery of Amazon products will be limited to the Los Angeles and New York metropolitan areas which in New YorkÂ€Â™s case includes parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. In 2014 it is expected to expand to other cities including Dallas Houston New Orleans and Phoenix.         Among the primary beneficiaries of the new delivery schedule will be Amazon Prime members who pay an annual fee for premium services including free two-day shipping for certain items said Kelly Cheeseman a spokeswoman for Amazon. Â€ÂœNow every day can be an Amazon delivery dayÂ€Âù Ms. Cheeseman said.         Postal Service officials called the agreement an important step in diversifying its services and expanding those that make a profit. Â€ÂœConsumers have shown that there is a market for package deliveries seven days a week and we are glad to be in a position to partner with Amazon on providing this serviceÂ€Âù said Patrick R. Donahoe the postmaster general.         Neither Amazon nor the Postal Service would disclose financial arrangements or discuss the volume or revenue they expected to generate from Sunday deliveries. The Postal Service already delivers some packages on Sundays and holidays for an extra fee.         Shipping and package services have been one of the  That contributed to a decline in revenue to $65 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 2012 from nearly $75 billion in 2008. Shipping and package volume has increased to about 3.5 billion pieces since 2008 and accounts for about $11.6 billion in revenue for the agency.         Mr. Donahoe the postmaster general said the deal with Amazon was part of the Postal ServiceÂ€Â™s attempt to alter its business model. That effort includes increasing package delivery to take advantage of the growth of e-commerce streamlining the work force and eliminating mail delivery on Saturdays.         Though the Postal Service would continue to deliver packages on Saturdays the proposal to halt Saturday delivery has  The agency faces myriad problems that have led to its financial decline. It faces legal constraints that prevent it from diversifying into certain lines of business. It is also barred from raising postage prices faster than the rate of inflation.         But an even bigger cause of the financial decline is a 2006 law that requires the Postal Service unlike any other government agency to pay $5.5 billion a year into a health fund for its future retirees. The majority of the agencyÂ€Â™s losses since 2007 about $32 billion result from  As a result of its financial troubles the Postal Service has defaulted on three annual $5.5 billion payments into the health care fund. It has also exhausted its $15 billion borrowing limit from the Treasury Department. More recently the agency has asked for permission to  Congress is considering legislation that would overhaul the agency and ease the financial constraints but few anticipate a bill passing this year as lawmakers continue to wrestle with broader budget issues.         Â€ÂœWeÂ€Â™ve got to get this doneÂ€Âù Mr. Donahoe said. Â€ÂœThe faster we can get it done the faster we can focus attention away from all the negative attention about our financial situation and onto the positive things we do like this new agreement with Amazon.Â€Âù        9,1E+14,1,Article,News,"In Landmark Vote, Senate Limits Use of the Filibuster",U.S.,624,5.961,5.418,WASHINGTON Â€Â” The Senate approved the most fundamental alteration of its rules in more than a generation on Thursday ending the minority partyÂ€Â™s ability to filibuster most presidential nominees in response to the partisan gridlock that has plagued Congress for much of the Obama administration.         Furious Republicans accused Democrats of a power grab warning them that they would deeply regret their action if they lost control of the Senate next year and the White House in years to come. Invoking the Founding Fathers and the meaning of the Constitution Republicans said Democrats were trampling the minority rights the framers intended to protect. But when the vote was called Senator Harry Reid the majority leader who was initially reluctant to force the issue prevailed 52 to 48.         Under the change the Senate will be able to cut off debate on executive and judicial branch nominees with a simple majority rather than rounding up a supermajority of 60 votes. The new precedent established by the Senate on Thursday does not apply to Supreme Court nominations or legislation itself.         It represented the culmination of years of frustration over what Democrats denounced as a Republican campaign to stall the machinery of Congress stymie President ObamaÂ€Â™s agenda and block his choices for cabinet posts and federal judgeships by insisting that virtually everything the Senate approves be done by a supermajority.         After repeatedly threatening to change the rules Mr. Reid decided to follow through when Republicans refused this week to back down from their effort to keep Mr. Obama from filling any of three vacancies on the most powerful appeals court in the country.         This was the final straw for some Democratic holdouts against limiting the filibuster providing Mr. Reid with the votes he needed to impose a new standard certain to reverberate through the Senate for years.         Â€ÂœThere has been unbelievable unprecedented obstructionÂ€Âù Mr. Reid said as he set in motion the steps for the vote on Thursday. Â€ÂœThe Senate is a living thing and to survive it must change as it has over the history of this great country. To the average American adapting the rules to make the Senate work again is just common sense.Â€Âù         Republicans accused Democrats of irreparably damaging the character of an institution that in many ways still operates as it did in the 19th century and of disregarding the constitutional prerogative of the Senate as a body of Â€Âœadvice and consentÂ€Âù on presidential nominations.         Â€ÂœYou think this is in the best interest of the United States Senate and the American people?Â€Âù asked the Republican leader Senator Mitch McConnell sounding incredulous.         Â€ÂœI say to my friends on the other side of the aisle youÂ€Â™ll regret this. And you may regret it a lot sooner than you thinkÂ€Âù he added.         Mr. Obama applauded the SenateÂ€Â™s move. Â€ÂœTodayÂ€Â™s pattern of obstruction it just isnÂ€Â™t normalÂ€Âù he told reporters at the White House. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s not what our founders envisioned. A deliberate and determined effort to obstruct everything no matter what the merits just to refight the results of an election is not normal and for the sake of future generations we canÂ€Â™t let it become normal.Â€Âù         Only three Democrats voted against the measure.         The changes will apply to all 1183 executive branch nominations that require Senate confirmation Â€Â” not just cabinet positions but hundreds of high- and midlevel federal agency jobs and government board seats.         This fight was a climax to the bitter debate between the parties over electoral mandates and the consequences of presidential elections. Republicans through their frequent use of the various roadblocks that congressional procedure affords them have routinely thwarted Democrats. Democrats in turn have accused Republicans of effectively trying to nullify the results of a presidential election they lost whether by trying to dismantle his health care law or keep Mr. Obama from filling his cabinet.        24,1E+14,1,Article,News,Obama Signals a Shift From Military Might to Diplomacy,World,675,5.699,5.218,WASHINGTON Â€Â” The weekend ended with the first tangible sign of a nuclear deal with Iran after more than three decades of hostility. Then on Monday came the announcement that a conference will convene in January to try to broker an end to the civil war in Syria.         The success of either negotiation both long sought by President Obama is hardly assured Â€Â” in fact the odds may be against them. But the two nearly simultaneous developments were vivid statements that diplomacy the venerable but often-unsatisfying art of compromise has once again become the centerpiece of American foreign policy.         At one level the flurry of diplomatic activity reflects the definitive end of the post-Sept. 11 world dominated by two major wars and a battle against Islamic terrorism that drew the United States into Afghanistan and still keeps its Predator drones flying over Pakistan and Yemen.         But it also reflects a broader scaling-back of the use of American muscle not least in the Middle East as well as a willingness to deal with foreign governments as they are rather than to push for new leaders that better embody American values. Â€ÂœRegime changeÂ€Âù in Iran or even Syria is out; cutting deals with former adversaries is in.         For Mr. Obama the shift to diplomacy fulfills a campaign pledge from 2008 that he would stretch out a hand to AmericaÂ€Â™s enemies and speak to any foreign leader without preconditions. But it will also subject him to considerable political risks as the  Â€ÂœWeÂ€Â™re testing diplomacy; weÂ€Â™re not resorting immediately to military conflictÂ€Âù Mr. Obama said defending the Iran deal on Monday in San Francisco. Â€ÂœTough talk and bluster may be the easy thing to do politicallyÂ€Âù  Still diplomacy is a protracted messy business with often inconclusive results. It is harder for a president to rally the American public behind a multilateral negotiation than a missile strike though the deep war weariness of Americans has reinforced Mr. ObamaÂ€Â™s instinct for negotiated settlements over unilateral action.         White House officials suggest that the president always planned to arrive at this moment and that everything that came before it Â€Â” from the troop surge in Afghanistan to the commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden Â€Â” was cleaning up after his predecessor.         Â€ÂœIn 2009 we had 180000 troops in two wars and a ton of legacy issues surrounding terrorismÂ€Âù said Benjamin J. Rhodes a deputy national security adviser. Â€ÂœSo much that was done out of the box was winding down those wars. WeÂ€Â™ve shifted from a very military face on our foreign policy to a very diplomatic face on our foreign policy.Â€Âù         Much of that diplomacy has been on public display in the  But some of the crucial dealings have occurred in the shadows. In March administration officials said Mr. Obama authorized a small team of senior officials from the White House and the State Department to travel secretly to Oman the Arab sultanate where they met face to face with Iranian officials to explore the possibility of a nuclear deal.         The cloak-and-dagger was necessary the officials said because it allowed the United States and Iran to discuss the outlines of a nuclear deal without fear that details would leak out. Cutting out others eliminated the competing agendas that come with the six negotiating partners engaged in the formal Geneva talks.         But the disclosure that the United States and Iran had been talking privately angered France which registered its displeasure two weeks ago by warning that the proposal then being discussed was too lenient and that it would not accept a Â€ÂœsuckerÂ€Â™s deal.Â€Âù         For all of Mr. ObamaÂ€Â™s emphasis on diplomacy analysts noted that the United States often depends on others to take the initiative. In the case of Iran it was the election of Hassan Rouhani as president with his mandate to seek a relaxation of punishing sanctions.         In the case of Syria it was a Russian proposal for President Bashar al-Assad to turn over and destroy his chemical weapons stockpiles an option the White House seized on as a way of averting a military strike that Mr. Obama first threatened and then backed off from.        75,1E+14,1,Article,News,Obama in Bind Trying to Keep Health Law Vow,U.S.,664,5.887,5.534,WASHINGTON Â€Â” Under intense bipartisan pressure to answer mounting consumer complaints about the botched health care rollout White House officials are struggling to make good on President ObamaÂ€Â™s promise that Americans can keep their insurance coverage without undermining the new health law or adding unaffordable costs.         After the presidentÂ€Â™s apology last week for wrongly assuring Americans that they could retain their health plans if they wanted senior White House aides said the president wanted to ensure that people who were forced off older policies with less comprehensive coverage were not stuck with higher monthly premiums to replace their insurance. But administration officials declined to say how they might achieve that goal how much it would cost or whether it would require congressional approval.         At the same time officials signaled the presidentÂ€Â™s strong opposition to calls from across the political spectrum Â€Â” including one Tuesday from a key ally former President Bill Clinton Â€Â” to support bipartisan legislation that would allow people to keep their current insurance plans even after provisions of the Affordable Care Act go into effect next year.         White House officials refused to discuss in detail what options Mr. Obama was considering. But they made clear that the president was skeptical of any solution that would allow insurance companies to continue selling what officials consider to be cheap and substandard policies.         Â€ÂœBroadly speaking we do not see that as fixing the problemÂ€Âù Jay Carney the White House press secretary said Tuesday.         The split between lawmakers and the White House reflects the dilemma the president finds himself in as he seeks to follow through on last weekÂ€Â™s acknowledgment about his incorrect promise on health care coverage. Hundreds of thousands of people have received cancellation notices from health insurance companies because their plans do not conform with minimum standards set by the new law.         With lawmakers promoting their simple-sounding solution the challenge for Mr. Obama is to find a workable and politically practical way to address the issue to the satisfaction of those who have lost policies.         Â€ÂœAny fix that would essentially open up for insurers to sell new plans that did not meet the standards would create more problems than it would fixÂ€Âù Mr. Carney told reporters. It was unclear how the administration could make new plans more affordable or whether that solution would be interpreted by Americans as keeping the promise that the president made in selling the health care law. Republicans in Congress would be certain to oppose efforts by the White House to expand subsidies.         The idea of passing legislation to allow all Americans to keep their coverage got a fresh boost on Tuesday when Mr. Clinton added his voice to the debate. In an  Â€ÂœI personally believe even if it takes a change in the law the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they gotÂ€Âù Mr. Clinton said in the interview published by Ozy a web magazine.         Mr. Clinton who tried to pass a health care overhaul during his presidency has been a powerful advocate for the Affordable Care Act especially among the presidentÂ€Â™s key Democratic constituencies. And Mr. ClintonÂ€Â™s wife Hillary Rodham Clinton is weighing a White House bid in 2016 that could be affected by the fortunes of the health care law.         Mr. Clinton followed a steady stream of Democrats who have announced their support for legislation to let people keep their coverage. Senator Dianne Feinstein Democrat of California endorsed one such effort by Senators Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia both Democrats.         Â€ÂœSince the beginning of September I have received 30842 calls emails and letters from Californians many of whom are very distressed by cancellations of their insurance policies and who are facing increased out-of-pocket costsÂ€Âù Ms. Feinstein said. Â€ÂœThe Landrieu bill is a common-sense fix that will protect individuals in the private insurance market from being forced to change their insurance plans.Â€Âù         Ms. Landrieu who faces a difficult election fight next year said the cancellation notices Â€Âœshould have never gone out.Â€Âù        51,1E+14,1,Article,News,Obamaâ€™s Portable Zone of Secrecy (Some Assembly Required),U.S.,551,5.785,5.657,WASHINGTON Â€Â” When  Even when Mr. Obama travels to allied nations aides quickly set up the security tent Â€Â” which has opaque sides and noise-making devices inside Â€Â” in a room near his hotel suite. When the president needs to read a classified document or have a sensitive conversation he ducks into the tent to shield himself from secret video cameras and listening devices.         American security officials demand that their bosses Â€Â” not just the president but members of Congress diplomats policy makers and military officers Â€Â” take such precautions when traveling abroad because it is widely acknowledged that their hosts often have no qualms about snooping on their guests.         The United States has come under withering criticism in recent weeks about revelations that the  Â€ÂœNo matter where you are we are a target these daysÂ€Âù said R. James Woolsey Jr. the director of central intelligence during the Clinton administration. Â€ÂœNo matter where we go countries like China Russia and much of the Arab world have assets and are trying to spy on us so you have to think about that and take as many precautions as possible.Â€Âù         On a trip to Latin America in 2011 for example a White House photo showed Mr. Obama talking from a security tent in a Rio de Janeiro hotel suite with Hillary Rodham Clinton then the secretary of state and Robert M. Gates the defense secretary at the time about the air war against Libya that had been launched the previous day. Another photo taken three days later in San Salvador showed him conferring from the tent with advisers about the attack.         Spokesmen for the State Department the C.I.A. and the National Security Council declined to provide details on the measures the government takes to protect officials overseas. But more than a dozen current and former government officials most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity described in interviews some of those measures.         They range from instructing officials traveling overseas to assume every utterance and move is under surveillance and requiring them to scrub their cellphones for listening devices after they have visited government offices to equipping the presidentÂ€Â™s limousine which always travels with him to keep private conversations private. Mr. Obama carries a specially encrypted BlackBerry; one member of his cabinet was told he could not take his iPad on an overseas trip because it was not considered a secure device.         Countermeasures are taken on American soil as well. When cabinet secretaries and top national security officials take up their new jobs the government retrofits their homes with special secure rooms for top-secret conversations and computer use.         In accordance with a several-hundred-page classified manual the rooms are lined with foil and soundproofed. An interior location preferably with no windows is recommended. One of the most recent recipients: James B. Comey the new director of the F.B.I. whose homes in the Washington area and New England were retrofitted.         During the Cold War a former senior official said listening devices were found embedded in the walls and light fixtures of the hotels where American diplomats stayed. These days the official said American analysts worry more about eavesdropping radio signals beamed toward hotel rooms in the hopes of picking up officialsÂ€Â™ conversations.         Â€ÂœWe took it for granted that in some of these hotels no matter the state that devices were built in thereÂ€Âù the official said.        141,1E+14,0,Article,News,"Billy Joel, Shirley MacLaine Feted at Kennedy Center Honors",Arts,649,5.56,6.07,"WASHINGTON Â€Â” With notes of rock jazz and opera Washington feted piano man Billy Joel actress Shirley MacLaine and guitarist Carlos Santana on Sunday at the Kennedy Center Honors the capital's annual celebration of the arts.         Jazz pianist Herbie Hancock and opera singer Martina Arroyo rounded out the list of honorees at the country's prestigious awards ceremony for stars of the stage screen and concert hall.         ""The diverse group of extraordinary individuals we honor today haven't just proven themselves to be the best of the best"" President Barack Obama said at a White House ceremony before the show.         ""Despite all their success all their fame they've remained true to themselves - and inspired the rest of us to do the same.""         The evening started with a tribute to Santana a 10-time Grammy winner originally from Mexico.         Singer Harry Belafonte himself a Kennedy Center honoree joked that he was a victim of the Latino musician's greatness saying he thought Santana got his spot in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.         ""We should've built a bigger fence"" he deadpanned referring to the debate in Washington about immigration reform and border security with Mexico.         ""The Latino thing has arrived. It has become the new black. And now Carlos is a citizen of the world.""         The theme continued when Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor the first Hispanic member of the nation's highest court introduced opera diva Arroyo. The daughter of a Puerto Rican father and an African-American mother Arroyo grew up in an unlikely place for a future opera star: New York City's Harlem neighborhood.         ""Martina faced an uphill battle"" Sotomayor said. ""She never gave up.""         Musicians filled the Kennedy Center with opera and Santana's unique fusion sound in honor of the two performers.         Then rapper Snoop Dogg electrified the stage with a rap tribute to Hancock the keyboardist and band leader who hails from the Obamas' home state of Illinois.         ""Hey Herbie you know we love you baby"" the rapper shouted. ""Thank you for creating Hip Hop!""         THE ACTRESS AND THE PIANO MAN         MacLaine who won an Oscar for her performance in the 1983 film ""Terms of Endearment"" was the sole actress highlighted during a night dominated by musicians.         ""Ask me how my feet are and ask me how my back is and ask me where my martini is"" she joked on Saturday at a State Department reception for the honorees.         MacLaine grew up in the Washington area and joins her brother actor Warren Beatty as a recipient of the award.         ""It's more about my life and my past and my background and my home and my parents and dancing and work ethic"" she told Reuters. ""This is squaring the circle of living here.""         MacLaine's other-worldly beliefs described in her many books also got some ribbing.         Perhaps the most emotional moment of the night came during the tribute to Joel who's songs were described as a soundtrack for the lives of generations of Americans.         During a performance of Joel's song ""Goodnight Saigon"" a group of Vietnam veterans came on stage to sing along as Garth Brooks crooned the words ""And we would all go down together.""         The veterans saluted Joel at the end of the ballad. He saluted back.         ""It's a little overwhelming"" Joel told Reuters on Saturday night referring to the award.         Asked to pick a favorite song or album the composer - who has focused on his ""first love"" of writing instrumental music in recent years - demurred.         ""I like 'em all. They're kinda like my kids. It's hard to pick a favorite"" he said. ""I like something about all of 'em. I remember the birth.""         The final performance of the evening was Joel's famous hit ""Piano Man"" with the Kennedy Center audience singing along.         The show which was recorded on Sunday will be broadcast on CBS on December 29.

If youÂ€Â™ve followed his career at all you know how committed this guy was to winning. Last week I happened to see the trailer for the documentary Â€Âœ Â€ÂœI like to win but more than anything I canÂ€Â™t stand this idea of losing. Because to me losing means death.Â€Âù         It played out that way. Armstrong decided that avoiding the pain of losing was worth any cost. Now it seems as if it could very well cost him everything.         Turns out that most of us donÂ€Â™t like losing. In fact itÂ€Â™s what the academics call loss aversion. We feel the pain of loss more acutely than we feel the pleasure of gain. In other words we may like to win but we  The psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky showed that even something  Â€ÂœIn my classes I say: Â€Â˜IÂ€Â™m going to toss a coin and if itÂ€Â™s tails you lose $10. How much would you have to gain on winning in order for this gamble to be acceptable to you?Â€Â™         Â€ÂœPeople want more than $20 before it is acceptable. And now IÂ€Â™ve been doing the same thing with executives or very rich people asking about tossing a coin and losing $10000 if itÂ€Â™s tails. And they want $20000 before theyÂ€Â™ll take the gamble.Â€Âù         In other words weÂ€Â™re willing to leave a lot of money on the table to avoid the possibility of losing.         We see this aversion to loss play out in the lives of real people when we try to make smart money decisions especially when itÂ€Â™s time to make a change to our investments. It almost doesnÂ€Â™t matter what change we need to make. We hesitate to change from the current situation because it means having an opinion and making a decision. And with a decision comes the very real possibility that weÂ€Â™ll make the wrong one. Sticking with the status quo feels much better even if we know itÂ€Â™s costing us money.         Just think of the things you wonÂ€Â™t do even though you know you should. For example letÂ€Â™s imagine that a few years ago you invested in the process of planning and built a financial plan based on your values and goals. Now you have a portfolio of low-cost diversified investments but youÂ€Â™re still holding on to a stock your brother-in-law recommended years before that went down right after you bought it. It clearly doesnÂ€Â™t fit in your plan. Every rational thought every spreadsheet and every calculator tells you that itÂ€Â™s past time to get rid of it but you donÂ€Â™t.         Making the choice to sell would mean realizing a loss and IÂ€Â™m not just talking from a tax perspective. To some degree it means admitting weÂ€Â™ve made a mistake but weÂ€Â™d feel the loss too. As weÂ€Â™ve discussed weÂ€Â™re wired to go to great lengths to avoid that feeling. Once we realize that loss and open ourselves up to the pain of that experience weÂ€Â™ll discover that we feel almost twice the emotion over a loss as opposed to a gain.         To get past our aversion to loss I recommend taking the Overnight Test. ItÂ€Â™s something IÂ€Â™ve discussed previously but itÂ€Â™s an excellent tool that helps us separate the emotion from a decision. LetÂ€Â™s go back to the earlier example. You have a low-cost diversified portfolio and you have the stock your brother-in-law recommended. Now letÂ€Â™s play a little game.         Imagine you went to bed and overnight someone sold the stock and replaced it with cash. The next morning you have a choice: You can buy back the brother-in-lawÂ€Â™s recommended stock for the same price or you can take that cash and add it to your well-designed portfolio. What would you do?         Most people wouldnÂ€Â™t buy the stock back.         Just by changing your perspective (investing cash versus getting rid of the stock) you can gain clarity and have the emotional space to make the decision you know you need to make. Sometimes thatÂ€Â™s all it takes. While weÂ€Â™ll probably never embrace loss itÂ€Â™s good to know that we can find ways to work around our aversion to it when it makes sense.        77,1E+14,1,Article,News,"Rejecting Billions, Snapchat Expects a Better Offer",Technology,1029,5.844,5.792,What business makes no money has yet to pass its third anniversary and just turned down an offer worth billions of dollars? Snapchat a social media service run by a pair of 20-somethings who until last month worked out of a beachfront bungalow in Venice Calif.         Thanks to todayÂ€Â™s rabid rat race for the hottest social media start-ups Snapchat has joined the list of tech companies Â€Â” like Tumblr and Instagram Â€Â” with no money coming in but multiple sky-high takeover offers. So far SnapchatÂ€Â™s leaders have balked at the offers according to three people with knowledge of the overtures including a recent multibillion-dollar proposal from  ItÂ€Â™s not that they donÂ€Â™t want billions of dollars. In part itÂ€Â™s because they think making a deal now would leave many billions more on the table.         The service started in 2011 by Evan Spiegel 23 and Bobby Murphy 25 two former Stanford fraternity brothers lets users send photo and video messages that disappear after they are viewed. Snapchat quickly gained a reputation as an easy way to send sexually suggestive photos but it also picked up steam as a fun and easy way to trade photo messages.         The company has in recent months become one of the most sought-after businesses in the tech industry getting attention from top Silicon Valley companies and venture capital firms as well as international technology companies.         In the past several start-ups found even greater success by passing up a billion dollars or more including Facebook and Twitter. Even Twitter with its red-hot debut on the public market still has skeptics who question whether it can grow enough to justify its current market capitalization of more than $20 billion.         But Silicon Valley is littered with many more entrepreneurs whose big dreams went unfulfilled people who were at the helm of the next big thing and lost momentum before they could cash out.         Â€ÂœI think this is classic bird-in-hand versus bird-in-bushÂ€Âù said Julie A. Ask an analyst at Forrester Research. Â€ÂœSnapchat must believe the bird-in-bush is bigger.Â€Âù         There are some suggestions about why Snapchat thinks it will be worth far more later than it is now. For one thing SnapchatÂ€Â™s leaders think it might be one of the first social media companies in the United States to build its business largely around revenue beyond advertising.         On stage at an industry event in September Mr. Spiegel said that he wanted to duplicate the success of overseas chatting applications like WeChat.         Many such companies particularly WeChat and Line have found ways to make money from their applications through virtual goods and games. WeChat which is based in China and operated by a company called Tencent allows its users to subscribe to brands like Starbucks and Nike and receive messages from them. Line a Japanese messaging app has $10 million a month in revenue from selling stickers that users can send to each other while chatting with friends.         But the decision appears to have also been influenced by one of SnapchatÂ€Â™s big venture backers Benchmark Capital according to a person close to the talks. Before leading an investment in Snapchat Benchmark led an early bet on Instagram a photo service and was disappointed when InstagramÂ€Â™s founders decided to sell to Facebook for $1 billion last year. Despite the high price tag the firm thought Instagram could have succeeded as a stand-alone company or at least could have brought a higher offer.         Eight months after the Instagram sale Benchmark switched tactics and placed an initial $13 million bet on Snapchat. Benchmark executives thought they might be able to profit from Facebook fatigue by investing in services like Snapchat that offered users Â€Â” particularly teenagers Â€Â” greater privacy.         It is those teenagers who most interest Facebook. In an earnings call this month Facebook said that its youngest users were using its service less.         Still the news about Snapchat rejecting FacebookÂ€Â™s offer Snapchat and applications like it represent a coming sea change in social media one not necessarily defined by shared or public interactions. These services present an antidote to mainstream services that are meant to capture life moments so they can be shared liked and commented on. SnapchatÂ€Â™s appeal lies largely in the lack of permanence. It offers a reprieve from worrying about awkward or unflattering photos turning up unexpectedly.         Snapchat recently said that it now processed upward of 350 million messages a day. In February the company was processing only 60 million a day.         Other messaging services similar to Snapchat are also quickly gaining in popularity. WhatsApp KakaoTalk Kik WeChat and Line to name a few have added hundreds of millions of users in the last few years and each continues to grow.         That rocketlike growth has emboldened SnapchatÂ€Â™s leaders to hold out for a better deal and with a suitor of their choice at least for now. One person with knowledge of the talks who would speak only on the condition of anonymity said one roadblock in the talks with Facebook was that Mr. Spiegel questioned whether he wanted to work for Mark Zuckerberg FacebookÂ€Â™s young billionaire chief executive.         In addition Snapchat relishes being a successful company outside Silicon Valley. In December when the company was still getting its footing in the social media market Mr. Zuckerberg requested a meeting. But he traveled to Venice Calif. to meet with the company according to SnapchatÂ€Â™s founders instead of them visiting him at his headquarters in Northern California.         Shortly after the meeting Facebook started a similar product called Poke. But Poke never took off. Even FacebookÂ€Â™s stand-alone messaging product called Messenger has struggled to attain the same kind of momentum that rivals have gained. Facebook released a new Messenger mobile app on Wednesday.         And in Silicon Valley where something new could pop up at any time tech companies and investors are often compelled to act when they can Â€Â” sometimes with fear and little regard for the number of zeros involved.         Another potential suitor for Snapchat is Tencent one of the three Internet giants in China. In September Pony Ma one of the founders of Tencent spoke of that constant tension when discussing his interest in Snapchat.         Â€ÂœIÂ€Â™m facing a crisis in this industry said Mr. Ma. Â€ÂœYoung people the things they like on the Internet increasingly I donÂ€Â™t understand it.

A  Â€ÂœBehind every big momentÂ€Âù reads a title card Â€Âœthere are lots of small ones.Â€Âù Now the snowboarder who looks barely old enough to stand snowboards down a sloping front yard and is scooped up by an adult.         Â€ÂœTD AmeritradeÂ€Âù says the actor Matt Damon the voice of the brand at the close of the spot Â€Âœhelping you reach your long-term goals one small step at a time.Â€Âù         Commercials featuring Mr. Vito and other athletes the company is sponsoring will begin appearing on television and online Monday. Some moments in the commercials including the closing footage of the snowboarder in the front yard are staged shot recently using actors in a grainy home-movie style. The commercials some of which use several clips with younger actors pretending to be the athletes contain no disclosure about doing so.         The spots are by Goodby Silverstein & Partners San Francisco part of the Omnicom Group with direction by Noam Murro and production by Biscuit Filmworks. A social media extension of the campaign is by Huge Brooklyn part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.         TD Ameritrade reports spending $239 million on advertising for its fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30. Dedra DeLilli director of marketing and corporate sponsorship at TD Ameritrade said that while the company was widely known for helping investors trade stocks on the go the Olympics campaign was meant to Â€Âœtalk more about long-term investing tools and programsÂ€Âù like Individual Retirement Accounts.         Â€ÂœAthletes take a lot of small steps every day in the journey to make it to the Olympic GamesÂ€Âù Ms. DeLilli said. Â€ÂœAs a brokerage firm we feel that a goal of saving $1 million or $2 million can also be daunting but there are small steps that consumers can take to make that goal not so daunting.Â€Âù         One new TD Ameritrade commercial featuring the speed skater J. R. Celski includes footage of him sprawled on the ice which is splattered with blood after  Margaret Johnson an executive creative director at Goodby Silverstein & Partners said including such moments would resonate with investors who have weathered fluctuations in financial markets in recent years.         Â€ÂœThere are hiccups along the way for both athletes and people who are investingÂ€Âù Ms. Johnson said. Â€ÂœIt doesnÂ€Â™t always go smoothly but youÂ€Â™ve got to keep your eye on that long-term goal.Â€Âù         When advertising agencies develop a concept for a commercial they create a storyboard that functions as a blueprint including every camera shot and the script. But in this case the agency asked the athletes and their families to send all the video and photographs they could and each commercial was made more organically.         Â€ÂœWe were getting these giant boxes of family albums old Super 8 footage videos everythingÂ€Âù Ms. Johnson said. Â€ÂœSo it didnÂ€Â™t work the way it typically does with storyboarding and then shooting but instead it was almost like scrapbooking.Â€Âù         In what the brand is calling a first it also is sending seven athletes aged 14 to 21 to the Winter Games in Sochi Russia in February who are not competing but hope to qualify for the Winter Olympics in 2018. These next-generation athletes as the brand refers to them compete in the same sports as the sponsored Olympic athletes who will act as their mentors.         TD Ameritrade set up brokerage accounts for these next-generation athletes and once they arrive in Russia every time consumers use the hashtag #itaddsup the company will add $1 to a fund that will be split equally in their accounts with each receiving a total of as much as $25000.         Conor Brady chief creative officer of Huge said brands often used social media Â€Âœas a bolt on to other channelsÂ€Âù like advertising. But he continued the TD Ameritrade effort Â€Âœis almost crowdsourcing to invest in the futures of these athletes.Â€Âù          Joe Favorito who teaches in the sports management program at Columbia University noted that Joe Moglia the former chief executive of TD Ameritrade (and still the chairman of its board) is now the football coach at Coastal Carolina University and said it reinforced a connection between financial and athletic strategy.         Mr. Favorito lauded the brand for highlighting athletes who hope to participate in the Winter Olympics in 2018.         Â€ÂœMost Olympics sponsors have shied away from that sort of a long-term approachÂ€Âù Mr. Favorito said. Â€ÂœThatÂ€Â™s unique but I guess the message to their clients is that like the trading market this is a long-term play.Â€Âù        107,1E+14,1,Article,News,Custody Battle Raises Questions About the Rights of Women,U.S.,626,5.568,5.62,When Bode Miller the Olympic ski star known for daring Alpine racing met Sara A. McKenna in San Diego last year through the high-end matchmaker Kelleher International they were both professing interest in finding a marriage partner she recalls.         The relationship did not last long Â€Â” but she did become pregnant. And now the skier 36 and Ms. McKenna 27 a former Marine and firefighter who is attending Columbia University with G.I. Bill support are locked in a cross-country custody fight that has become not only tabloid fodder but also a closely watched legal battle over the rights of pregnant women to travel and make life choices.         In December when she was seven months pregnant and already sparring with Mr. Miller about their future relations Ms. McKenna moved to New York to start school. Mr. Miller accused her of fleeing to find a sympathetic court and a New York judge agreed castigating Ms. McKenna for virtually absconding with her fetus. This allowed a California court to subsequently grant custody of the baby a boy to Mr. Miller and also set off alarm bells among advocates for womenÂ€Â™s rights.         But on Nov. 14 a five-judge appeals court in New York said Ms. McKennaÂ€Â™s basic rights had been violated adding Â€ÂœPutative fathers have neither the right nor the ability to restrict a pregnant woman from her constitutionally protected liberty.Â€Âù         The appeals court also ruled that jurisdiction belonged in New York.         On Monday a New York City Family Court will start proceedings that could switch custody of the boy now nine months old back to Ms. McKenna.         But a tug of war between courts in two states remains possible because the San Diego judge has not yet ceded jurisdiction.         It is an unusual celebrity custody case not centered on extravagant financial demands or questions about paternity. Both sides say they hope for Â€Âœco-parentingÂ€Âù but relations have been poisoned by what Ms. McKenna says is a steamroller campaign by Mr. Miller to push her to the margins and by what Mr. Miller calls the motherÂ€Â™s uncooperative behavior based on a quest for revenge.         They cannot even agree on what to call the boy. When he was born in New York on Feb. 23 Ms. McKenna pointedly gave the newborn Mr. MillerÂ€Â™s given names registering him as Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna. She calls him Sam. Mr. Miller won permission from the California court to add Nathaniel as a middle name in honor of his recently deceased brother and he calls the boy Nate.         WomenÂ€Â™s rights advocates called the early decisions questioning Ms. McKennaÂ€Â™s behavior a threat to the autonomy of pregnant women and applauded the appeals court reversal.         Â€ÂœEspecially with current political pressures to recognize separate legal rights for fetuses there will be increasing calls on the courts to fault a pregnant woman for moving to restrain women from living their lives because theyÂ€Â™re pregnantÂ€Âù said Sarah E. Burns the head of the Reproductive Justice Clinic at the New York University law school.         Ms. Burns was an author along with several womenÂ€Â™s rights groups of a  Mr. Miller is currently training for the Sochi Winter Olympics. In October 2012 he married Morgan Beck a beach volleyball star and model he started dating around the time Ms. McKenna became pregnant. They often travel together to tournaments and promotional events posting pictures of Nate on social media.         The marriage provided new grist for conflict. Ms. McKenna has accused Ms. Miller who announced that she had a miscarriage in January of seeking to replace her as a mother. Ms. Miller in a blog post on Nov. 16 that was soon taken down contrasted their Â€Âœloving and balanced familyÂ€Âù with Ms. McKennaÂ€Â™s heavy reliance on child care.         Ms. McKenna joined the Marines at 17 and four years later became a firefighter at Camp Pendleton the Marine base near San Diego.        59,1E+14,1,Article,Op-Ed,Where Is the Love?,Opinion,500,5.899,5.684,When IÂ€Â™ve written recently  A reader named Keith reflected a coruscating chorus when he protested: Â€ÂœIf kids are going hungry it is because of the parents not upholding their responsibilities.Â€Âù         A reader in Washington bluntly suggested taking children from parents and putting them in orphanages.

But remember also that many of todayÂ€Â™s poor are small children who have done nothing wrong.         Some 45 percent of food stamp recipients are children for example. Do we really think that kids should go hungry if they have criminal parents? Should a little boy not get a curved spine treated properly because his dad is a deadbeat? Should a girl not be able to go to preschool because her mom is an alcoholic?         Successful people tend to see in themselves a simple narrative: You study hard work long hours obey the law and create your own good fortune. Well yes.

But if youÂ€Â™re conceived by a teenage mom who drinks during pregnancy so that youÂ€Â™re born with fetal alcohol effects the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against you from before birth. YouÂ€Â™ll perhaps never get traction.         Likewise if youÂ€Â™re born in a high-poverty neighborhood to a stressed-out single mom who doesnÂ€Â™t read to you and slaps you more than hugs you youÂ€Â™ll face a huge handicap.  All this helps explain why one of the strongest determinants of ending up poor is being born poor. As Warren Buffett puts it our life outcomes often  John Rawls the brilliant 20th-century philosopher  As we celebrate Thanksgiving letÂ€Â™s remember that the difference between being surrounded by a loving family or being homeless on the street is determined not just by our own level of virtue or self-discipline but also by an inextricable mix of luck biography brain chemistry and genetics.         For those who are well-off it may be easier to castigate the irresponsibility of the poor than to recognize that success in life is a reflection not only of enterprise and willpower but also of random chance and early upbringing.         Low-income Americans who actually encounter the needy in daily life understand this complexity and respond with empathy.  And compassion isnÂ€Â™t a sign of weakness but a mark of civilization.        73,1E+14,1,Article,News,Coming Out as a Modern Family,Fashion & Style,719,5.045,5.823,When my 12-year-old son Jackson asked me if there was something I wasnÂ€Â™t telling him I replied Â€ÂœThere are a lot of things I donÂ€Â™t tell you.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœLike what?Â€Âù         Â€ÂœAdult stuff.Â€Âù         He persisted: Â€ÂœWhat kind of adult stuff?Â€Âù         This was the moment I had been anticipating and dreading for months. Â€ÂœLike romantic stuffÂ€Âù I said fumbling for words.         Â€ÂœWhat kind of romantic stuff?Â€Âù         Â€ÂœWellÂ€Âù I said. Â€ÂœLike how sometimes you can be friends with someone and then it turns romantic and then youÂ€Â™re friends again. Like with Dad and me. Or romantic like Bryn and me were and then he and I became friends.Â€Âù         Â€ÂœSo are you romantic with anyone right now?Â€Âù he asked.         I took a deep breath knowing that my answer and his response would have an impact on our lives for a very long time.         He was right; I was with someone romantically and I hadnÂ€Â™t told him. I had become involved with a woman who was my best friend and as it happens a person who is like a godmother to my son.         How and when should I tell him? When I explained the situation to a therapist she smiled and said Â€ÂœYour son may say a lot of things about you when heÂ€Â™s older but he will never say his mother was boring.Â€Âù         Her advice was to wait until he asked. And now here he was asking.         About a year before this conversation I had been sitting in my garden in California looking through photos and old journals I have kept since childhood. From a green tattered notebook with ink hearts drawn on it to the one I started in Haiti while helping after the earthquake there in January 2010 the journals told stories that seemed woven together by a similar theme.         I read about the handful of men and the one woman I had been in romantic relationships with passages rife with pain and angst. It seemed when I was physically attracted to someone I would put them in the box of being my Â€Âœsoul mateÂ€Âù and then be crushed when things didnÂ€Â™t turn out as I had hoped.         I read about the two men I fell for while working on films. I was sure each was my soul mate a belief fueled by sexual attraction that made me certain I was in love only to find that when the filming ended so did the relationship. And I read about the man who asked me to marry him four years ago over the phone before we had even kissed. Three months later we were in his kitchen throwing steaks at each otherÂ€Â™s heads in anger.         As I continued to look through photos I came across a black-and-white one of my best friend and me taken on New YearÂ€Â™s Eve. We looked so happy I couldnÂ€Â™t help but smile. I remembered how we had met two years before; she was sitting in a bar wearing a fedora and speaking in her Zimbabwean accent.         We had an immediate connection but didnÂ€Â™t think of it as romantic or sexual. She was one of the most beautiful charming brilliant and funny people I had ever met but it didnÂ€Â™t occur to me until that soul-searching moment in my garden that we could perhaps choose to love each other romantically.         What had I been waiting for all of these years? She is the person I like being with the most the one with whom I am most myself.         The next time I saw her in New York I shared my confusing feelings and we began the long painful wonderful process of trying to figure out what our relationship was supposed to be.         First how would it affect my son? He trusted Clare. He loved her. He had never met most of the men I had been in love with and had no idea I had been with a woman as well. Second how would it affect my career? I have never defined myself by whom I slept with but I know others have and would.         ItÂ€Â™s hard for me even to define the term Â€Âœpartner.Â€Âù For five years I considered my partner to be a friend then in his 70s John Calley with whom I talked daily. He was the one who picked me up each time I had a breakdown about another failed romance. Because we were platonic did that make him any less of a partner?        100,1E+14,1,Article,Op-Ed,A Cure for the Allergy Epidemic?,Opinion,717,5.794,5.66,WILL the cure for  Allergies are often seen as an accident. Your immune system misinterprets a harmless protein like dust or peanuts as a threat and when you encounter it you pay the price with  What prompts some immune systems to err like this while others never do? Some of the vulnerability is surely genetic. But comparative studies highlight the importance of environment beginning it seems in the womb. Microbes are one intriguing protective factor. Certain ones seem to stimulate a motherÂ€Â™s immune system during  By emulating this naturally occurring phenomenon scientists may one day devise a way to prevent allergies.         This task though still in its infancy has some urgency. Depending on the study and population the prevalence of allergic disease and  These days one in five American children have a respiratory allergy like  Nine people die daily from asthma attacks. While the increase in respiratory allergies shows some signs of leveling off the prevalence of food and skin allergies continues to rise. Five percent of children are allergic to peanuts milk and other foods half again as many as 15 years ago. And each new generation seems to have more severe potentially life-threatening  Some time ago I visited a place where seemingly protective microbes occurred spontaneously. It wasnÂ€Â™t a spotless laboratory in some university somewhere. It was a manure-spattered cowshed in IndianaÂ€Â™s Amish country.         My guide was Mark Holbreich an allergist in Indianapolis. HeÂ€Â™d recently discovered that the Amish people who lived in the northern part of the state were remarkably free of allergies and asthma.         About half of Americans have evidence of allergic sensitization which increases the risk of allergic disease. But judging from skin-prick tests just 7.2 percent of the 138 Amish children who Dr. Holbreich tested were sensitized to tree pollens and other allergens. That yawning difference positions the Indiana Amish among the least allergic populations ever described in the developed world.         This invulnerability isnÂ€Â™t likely to be genetic. The Amish originally came to the United States from the German-speaking part of Switzerland and these days Swiss children a genetically similar population are about as allergic as Americans.         Ninety-two percent of the Amish children Dr. Holbreich tested either lived on farms or visited one frequently. Farming Dr. Holbreich thinks is the Amish secret. This idea has some history. Since the late 1990s European scientists have investigated what they call the Â€Âœfarm effect.Â€Âù         The working hypothesis is that innocuous cowshed microbes plant material and raw milk protect farming children by favorably stimulating their immune systems throughout life particularly early on. That spring morning Dr. Holbreich gave me a tour of the bonanza of immune stimuli under consideration.         We found our hosts Andrew Mast and his wife Laura hard at work milking cows in the predawn chill.         Dr. Holbreich slight and bespectacled peppered them with questions. At what age did Mr. Mast begin working in the cowshed? Â€ÂœMy first memory is of milkingÂ€Âù he said at about the age of 5. What about his children two straw-haired girls then ages 2 and 3; did they spend time in the cowshed? The elder girl came to the barn at 3 months of age he said. Â€ÂœPeople learn to walk in here.Â€Âù Do expectant mothers work in the barn? Â€ÂœYesÂ€Âù Laura said. Â€ÂœWe work.Â€Âù         Dr. Holbreich had made his point: whatever forces were acting here they were chronic and they began before birth. As the sun rose Dr. Holbreich and I sniffed the damp fermented feed (slightly malty); shoveled fresh cow manure (Â€ÂœLiquid goldÂ€Âù Dr. Holbreich said only half-jokingly Â€Âœthe best medicine you could think ofÂ€Âù); and marveled at the detritus floating in the air. Extrapolating from previous research with each breath we were inhaling perhaps 1000 times more microbes than usual. By breakfast time grime had collected under our nails hay clung to our clothes and muck to our boots. Â€ÂœThereÂ€Â™s got to be bacteria mold and plant materialÂ€Âù Dr. Holbreich said. Â€ÂœYou do this every day for 30 years 365 days a year you can see there are so many exposures.Â€Âù         The challenge of identifying the important exposures Â€Â” and getting them into a bottle Â€Â” is a pressing one. In parts of the developing world where allergic disease was once considered rare scientists have noted an uptick especially in urban areas. China offers a dramatic case in point.

In Philadelphia snow began falling two hours before the Lions-Eagles kickoff and intensified after the game started. Workers used shovels and hand-held blowers to clear off yard lines.

Before the Vikings-Ravens game in Baltimore small tractors with plows and workers with shovels tried to clear the snow to no avail. After the snow let up tractors moved it from between the hash marks and shovels cleared the yard lines. The Ravens held off the Vikes 29-26.
