She finished her run one morning beneath cloudless blue skies and sat down with a visitor from Beijing in the lakeside boutique hotel started by her and her husband.         åÛåÏI think luxury is sunshine good air and good wateråÛå she said. åÛåÏBut in the big city you canåÛåªt get those things.åÛå         More than two years ago Ms. Lin 34 and her husband gave up comfortable careers in the booming southern city of Guangzhou åÛåÓ she at  a Norwegian risk management company  he at an advertising firm that he had founded åÛåÓ to join the growing number of urbanites who have decamped to rural China. One resident here calls them åÛåÏenvironmental refugeesåÛå or åÛåÏenvironmental immigrants.åÛå         At a time when hundreds of millions of Chinese many poor farmers are  leaving their country homesteads  to find work and tap into the energy of ChinaåÛåªs dynamic cities a small number of urban dwellers have decided to make a reverse migration. Their change in lifestyle speaks volumes about anxieties over pollution traffic living costs property values and the general stress found in ChinaåÛåªs biggest coastal metropolises.         Take  air quality : Levels of fine particulate matter in some Chinese cities reach  40 times  the recommended exposure limit set by the World Health Organization. This month an official Chinese news report said an 8-year-old  girl  near Shanghai was hospitalized with lung cancer the youngest such victim in China. Her doctor blamed air pollution.         The urban refugees come from all walks of life åÛåÓ businesspeople and artists teachers and chefs åÛåÓ though there is no reliable estimate of their numbers. They have staked out greener lives in small enclaves from central Anhui Province to remote Tibet. Many are Chinese bobos or bourgeois bohemians and they say that besides escaping pollution and filth they want to be unshackled from the material drives of the cities åÛåÓ what Ms. Lin derided as a focus on åÛåÏwhat youåÛåªre wearing where youåÛåªre eating comparing yourself with others.åÛå         The town of Dali in Yunnan Province nestled between a wall of 13000-foot mountains and one of ChinaåÛåªs largest freshwater lakes is a popular destination. Increasingly the indigenous ethnic Bai people of the area are leasing their village homes to ethnic Han the dominant group in China who turn up with suitcases and backpacks. They come with one-way tickets from places like Beijing Shanghai Guangzhou and Shenzhen all of which have roaring economies but also populations of 15 million people or more.         On Internet forums the new arrivals to Dali discuss how to rent a house where to shop how to make a living and what schools are best for their children. Their presence is everywhere in the cobblestone streets of the old town. They run cafes hotels and bookstores and the younger ones sit on the streets selling trinkets from blankets.         Some become farmers here and some spend their days home schooling their children. Their presence has transformed Dali and surrounding villages into a cross between Provence and Haight-Ashbury.         One magnet is the village of Shuanglang which became a draw after the famous Yunnan natives Yang Liping a dancer and Zhao Qing an artist built homes there. As at other lakeside villages the immigrants some with immense wealth live near fishermen and farmers.         åÛåÏAll kinds of people come here with different dreamsåÛå said Ye Yongqing 55 an ethnic Bai artist from the region who has lived mostly in cities including London but bought a home here five years ago. åÛåÏSome people imagine this place as Greece or Italy or Bali.åÛå         åÛåÏDali is one of the few places in China that still has a close tie to the earthåÛå he added sitting in front of a table of squashes in his garden courtyard. åÛåÏA lot of villages in China have become empty shells. Dali is a survivor of this phenomenon.åÛå         Ms. Lin said she first fell in love with Dali when she came as a backpacker in 2006. She returned twice before moving here. In 2010 on the third visit she and her husband whom she had met trekking in Yunnan looked for land to lease to build a hotel on Erhai Lake. It has not all been easy going Ms. Lin said citing negotiations and misunderstandings with local officials villagers and employees.         åÛåÏWe just wanted to switch to a different lifeåÛå said Ms. Lin who had lived in Shanghai as well as Guangzhou. åÛåÏMy friends in Shanghai are struggling there åÛåÓ not only in their work but also just to live. The prices are too high even higher than in Europe. They become crazy go mad.åÛå         Ms. Lin moved here less than two years after giving birth to a son. åÛåÏItåÛåªs good for the baby because itåÛåªs like my motheråÛåªs childhoodåÛå she said. åÛåÏMy motheråÛåªs childhood in Shanghai åÛåÓ the air was still clean you could see blue skies there was clean water.åÛå         That is a common refrain among parents here. One afternoon four mothers all urban refugees sat outside a bookstore cafe SongåÛåªs Nest practicing English with one another. åÛåÏThe one thing we all have in common is we moved here to raise our children in a good environmentåÛå one woman said.         The bookshopåÛåªs owner Song Yan moved here this year and translates books by an Indian philosopher popular with Chinese spiritual seekers. One night she and another translator and urban refugee Zheng Yuantao 33 talked over dinner about their moves.         åÛåÏIåÛåªve never felt so free in my lifeåÛå Mr. Zheng said. åÛåÏI grew up as a city boy and I never realized how much I like living close to nature.åÛå         From the nearby lakeside village of Caicun Huang Xiaoling a photographer flies back to Beijing to shoot portraits and events for clients. She had once lived in a courtyard home in the Chinese capital but fled in September with her 3-year-old son and husband an American who works remotely as a technology director for a New York publishing company.         åÛåÏIåÛåªm still productive even though I donåÛåªt go into an officeåÛå she said. åÛåÏI donåÛåªt know if itåÛåªs the weather and the environment or just me feeling that åÛå÷Oh I got out of the cave that I wanted to escape.åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå

As if he werenåÛåªt already teetering on the edge a  Christmas  Eve visit to a bar is no help to Jimmy StewartåÛåªs desperate protagonist in åÛåÏItåÛåªs a Wonderful Life.åÛå Just before resolving to end it all he gets hammered at the hands of  one of the least agreeable barmen on film  in a bar where even an angel gets no respect.         Then thereåÛåªs Jack LemmonåÛåªs hapless C. C. Baxter in åÛåÏThe ApartmentåÛå who is forced out of his lodgings on Christmas so his no-good boss can rendezvous there with his mistress leaving Baxter with no choice but to repair to a saloon. There he finds  a great thrum of festivity  but the merriment as conceived by the brilliantly cynical Billy Wilder is hollow at its core. Baxter chain-smokes and drinks martini after martini fraternizing miserably with a fellowship of the forlorn.         The message from these Hollywood classics is clear: a bar is no place to be at Christmas. ItåÛåªs a last resort the bottom of the barrel a holiday holding pen for losers and lowlifes the unloved and unlucky.         IåÛåªve been there.         IåÛåªve never had it as bad as Bailey or Baxter but I wasnåÛåªt exactly in a jolly mood the first time I spent a good portion of my holiday in a bar. I think it was the winter of my junior year in college. I came home to New York to celebrate with my family and got into a screaming match with my mother at the dinner table on Christmas Day.         So I did what any self-respecting angst-ridden young person would do: I excused myself from the table took a walk had a good sulk ate some Chinese food saw a movie and as my last stop before returning home hit a bar. No place special. Nowhere I had been before.         But instead of finding despair in there I encountered a measure of cheer and comfort that had eluded me at home at least that year. I had a whiskey and a few beers and I enjoyed a nice chat with a friendly bartender a couple of customers who had to work most of the day and another who was newish to New York.         I felt much better. I think we all did.         It turns out that around the holidays bars do exactly what they are always supposed to do: provide a place to blow off steam far from the demands of home or office. This season may be the most treasured time to spend with family but it can also foment discord. Expectations are high. Our homes are supposed to be festively decked out. Our cooking should be perfectly timed and unimpeachably delicious.         With the holidays come pressure whether we spend them with our families or not. And the bar is one place that can relieve that pressure.         Like those whom I met during college break many of the people youåÛåªll find at bars during the holidays are trying to relax after a workday or are new to town. But itåÛåªs not a default for everyone; for some of us itåÛåªs a choice.         A bar holiday may be tinged with melancholy but itåÛåªs a sweet sort of melancholy. (Its tone is captured perfectly IåÛåªm compelled to say in  John Denver and Rowlf the DogåÛåªs rendition of åÛåÏHave Yourself A Merry Little ChristmasåÛå  on the åÛåÏJohn Denver and the Muppets: A Christmas TogetheråÛå TV special in 1979.)         I am not alone in my view that a bar can be a source of holiday comfort. åÛåÏI donåÛåªt know if itåÛåªs anything specialåÛå the playwright Peter Gil-Sheridan said of Christmas at FlanneryåÛåªs Bar an Irish dive on West 14th Street åÛåÏbut it is to me.åÛå         Mr. Gil-Sheridan found the bar years ago when he was cat-sitting for a friend in the neighborhood. That friend later moved but Mr. Gil-Sheridan who lives in Brooklyn still returns almost every Christmas to FlanneryåÛåªs where the management serves a free turkey feast. åÛåÏI love that they unceremoniously put out some turkey and potatoes and stuffing and gravyåÛå he said. åÛåÏThereåÛåªs no announcement. ItåÛåªs just there in the back because itåÛåªs Christmas so of course thereåÛåªs some turkey around. And you kind of discover it and think åÛå÷Yeah IåÛåªll have some of that.åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå         Last year Mr. Gil-Sheridan and his partner had to fly to London on Christmas but they considered taking a night flight so they could spend the day at FlanneryåÛåªs. åÛåÏIn the end we decided against it but I missed itåÛå he said.         There are others whose bar Christmases have more closely resembled George BaileyåÛåªs. The British-born author and bartender Gary Regan recalled Christmas in 1975 his first in New York City. He was manning the bar at DrakeåÛåªs Drum an Upper East Side establishment he describes as åÛåÏa neighborhood joint that attracted rugby players and their groupiesåÛå as well as lawyers plumbers and artists.         Mr. Regan didnåÛåªt relish the idea of working on Christmas but his boss assured him the tips would make it worthwhile. Nearly 40 years later he remembers this as the worst bar shift of his life. Each customer was surlier than the last. åÛåÏThere was a damned good reason nobody had invited them anywhereåÛå he said         IåÛåªve spent Christmas on the working side of a bar too at  South  in South Park Slope Brooklyn. Last year Christmas fell on a Tuesday the day of my usual shift. I opened the bar at 5 p.m. The first hour was dead and foot traffic on Fifth Avenue was thin. åÛåÏWhy am I doing this?åÛå I wondered bracing myself for a lonely night.         But business picked up around 6 when regulars returned from early family dinners badly wanting drinks sans relatives. And knowing that I was working for the holiday several friends turned up to surprise me not a few bearing cookies and leftover pie and other gifts. Some sang along as my favorite holiday playlist issued from the speakers (including Rowlf and John Denver naturally). I lit some extra candles and soon enough you could feel some genuine Christmas cheer warming the room like the hot toddies warming my customers.         Even if thereåÛåªs no room at the inn thereåÛåªs plenty at the pub.          COMFORT AND JOY:  A sampling of bars open on Christmas.

The garbage strewn around the entrance was about as inviting as the prospect of walking nearly a mile under one of  Paris åÛåªs most famous parks not knowing what or whom to expect. We were in the heart of the city but completely removed from it.         But with four of us there was safety in numbers and so we set out into the darkness to explore one of the cityåÛåªs more hidden treasures: the Petite Ceinture. Forget the Catacombes or the ÌÄåägouts; impressive as ParisåÛåªs underground bone repository (the former) and sewers (the latter) are the abandoned  rail line encircling the city  offers urban hikers a new perspective.         A section of the line in the 16th Arrondissement was opened to the public as a nature trail in 2008 and another in the 15th Arrondissement was opened this summer; there is also a short path in the 12th. The Jardin de la Rue du Colonel ManhÌÄå¬s is a verdant narrow park in the 17th Arrondissement that runs parallel to the railway.         As nice as those are we wanted to see more of the Petite Ceinture and that meant exploring sections that have not been repurposed and that are not necessarily easy to hike. It is officially forbidden to walk the tracks with high fencing lining the entire beltway (ceinture means åÛåÏbeltåÛå in French) but for the most part the authorities look the other way. As Richard Prost who has lived in areas neighboring the tracks for most his life and  has made a documentary  on the subject put it: åÛåÏIf youåÛåªre a polite hiker the cops will simply ask you to leave.åÛå On a pleasant weekend dozens of intrepid Parisians can be found walking the rails.         Knowing where you can get in and out of the Petite Ceinture is critical. In most places the railway is sunken åÛåÓ the tracks are below street level which can feel like being in the bottom of a valley. Along the way there are tunnels trestles and elevated sections. We figured a good place to start was the Jardins du Ruisseau (Porte de Clignancourt MÌÄå©tro stop) near the MarchÌÄå© aux Puces on the northern edge of Paris. The community garden in the 18th Arrondissement has taken up residence along the north bank of the tracks and includes a chicken coop beehives and about three dozen plots bursting with a variety of vegetables and flowers. It is a great place to unwind on a warm afternoon but as it turns out a bad place to try to get onto the tracks. So we continued until we found a breach in the fence and started on our way.         Much of the 18th Arrondissement seemed a concrete wasteland of industrial infrastructure as we walked alone out of breath not so much from exertion but out of apprehension over what lay ahead and because we knew an easy exit would be all but impossible. The 33 kilometers (20 miles) of tracks surrounded Paris when they were built in the mid-19th century connecting passengers and freight with the cityåÛåªs major train stations. The Paris MÌÄå©tro gradually replaced the Petite Ceinture and in 1934 commuter service virtually ended. Freight trains continued to use the network until 1993.         Our urban hiking was tough going: The weeds were one reason; having to walk on the wooden ties or the loose rock between them was another. At a spot with chest-high overgrowth we crossed paths with our first taggeurs or graffiti artists of the day. We uttered a quick bonjour before scuttling off.         A massive heap of concrete beckoned. We were walking through what is listed on maps as a warehouse parking garage and a subway repair facility.         As we approached the Canal de låÛåªOurcq and the Parc de la Villette it didnåÛåªt help our anxiety levels to recall that until 1974 this was the site of the slaughterhouses of Paris åÛåÓ but it did beat the åÛåÏMad MaxåÛå zone we had just bushwhacked through. Confronted by a construction site and an active suburban train line we were forced to climb down from the tracks to cross the canal by a regular pedestrian bridge. While searching for a way back up we discovered a community of artists working in studios wedged between the arches that support this elevated section of track.         Flowers plants and bright artistic creations decorate the entrances to their vaulted workplaces. åÛåÏWeåÛåªve carved ourselves into the Petite CeintureåÛå Sylviane Borie said with a laugh. She is part of a loose collective of sculptors rap musicians and painters who have åÛåÏcreated links with the community and camaraderie amongst artistsåÛå she continued åÛåÏbut our voice isnåÛåªt being heard.åÛå Like the Petite Ceinture the collective is in legal no manåÛåªs land and is facing eviction.         Peeling back a sheet-metal partition that was blocking access to another construction site we ascended a long ramp that led up to a fence separating the site from the tracks. We found an opening in the fence and after hoisting ourselves over it we were back on the tracks. We soon realized we were above the Paris that we had seen a thousand times from ground level. From our elevated perspective we could see the Parisians on the way to their Sunday market waiting for the bus and children playing.

I heard a story of a drum sander running off a second-story deck a runaway buffer destroying a wall and of course many ruined floors.         åÛåÏNever againåÛå was the most common refrain.         ItåÛåªs hard to square such reactions with online tutorials produced in the can-do spirit of home improvement salesmanship. In one such video a woman strips her moribund kitchen floor without so much as a hint of sweat or effort.         Much like childbirth.         My floor project scored a solid 85 on the torture scale and I had help from three specialists: James Toal owner of Floors of Distinction in Connecticut; Phil Sanchez national account manager for Bona a manufacturer of cleaners and finishes for wood floors; and Charles Peterson a floor builder and author of åÛåÏA Complete Guide to Layout Installation & Finishing Wood FlooringåÛå (Taunton 2010). You can save thousands of dollars by doing the job yourself they said but not everyone can or should.         The project involves heavy machinery and power tools with vast destructive potential and procedural land mines that can mar the final product. And even when rookies navigate those obstacles they seldom achieve professional results.         So if your preholiday ambitions include taking a flyer on floor refinishing burn your plans. Then when you have a few days off from work and no party-organizing pressure start by dialing down your expectations.         åÛåÏYou wonåÛåªt do a good job with thisåÛå Mr. Peterson said. åÛåÏForgive me but not a chance.åÛå         While itåÛåªs easy to do a good job of coating a floor with a new finish taking the old finish off is mercilessly hard. Mr. Toal pointed out that many builders employ in-house specialists for electrical work plumbing and other arcane functions.         åÛåÏBut not sanding floorsåÛå he said. åÛåÏThey donåÛåªt want anything to do with it.åÛå         Neither did I but I lacked the budget to hire professionals for my entire floor and I couldnåÛåªt leave it as it was. A last-minute holiday refreshing a few years ago did not last long and the floors had reached a new level of nastiness since.         Where to begin?         On your knees my panelists said.         Remove a heating register or even a short strip of wood to make sure the floor is thick enough to sand. You need a minimum of one-eighth of an inch of wood above the tongue of the board Mr. Peterson said.         Even if you end up doing the floors yourself this might be a good time to call for a professional consultation. Mr. Toal said that some wood floor specialists will visit a home or offer phone-based guidance to people who are planning a do-it-yourself refinish. That counsel he said can extend to weekend or evening phone calls.         It may take several phone calls to find such a contractor but for $50 or $75 this sort of help can be a godsend.         Seek an estimate while youåÛåªre at it and compare it with your list of supplies and rental needs. Mine included a drum sander ($45 daily) orbit sander ($65 daily) buffer/grinder ($40 daily) and a van to haul equipment ($30 daily).         I also bought a Shop-Vac ($70) a small hand sander ($30) a scraper good kneepads plastic sheeting painteråÛåªs tape a pry bar wood filler and putty knife a nail set for burying nails tack cloth and paint pads.         Finally I invested in a half-face respirator ($30 from 3M) because cheaper masks offer poor protection against toxic wood dust. Total spent on supplies rental fees excluded: $425.         By comparison Mr. Peterson said reputable contractors will charge roughly $3 per square foot.         Spend an hour or two researching the inventory at nearby rental shops so you can minimize wasted trips. Then empty your rooms and your schedule. I allotted a day for clearing a day for prep and gathering supplies a day for sanding and a day for applying finish.

I wanted to pack him up and take him along but his life and work were in New York so we promised to visit each other during my one-year teaching contract and switched to cheap phone plans. We were going to be a progressive couple who could support each other in pursuing our dreams strong enough to let each other thrive apart.         We had met three years earlier when I was a 22-year-old English major just out of college living in Greenwich Village. He was standing by me in a deli line tall with blond spiky hair like Bart Simpson.         åÛåÏHope youåÛåªre not stuck with just hundredsåÛå he said to me pointing to a homemade åÛåÏNo Change for $100åÛå sign taped on the counter.         We talked until chairs were being stacked mops were moving and we had to be kicked out. We discovered we both had a band of freckles on our upper left arms that looked like the Big Dipper. Later he would hold me with that arm as we melded into one constellation on the futon in my tiny apartment.         Randy was my first serious relationship. It was 2001. He was the one I rushed to find when the twin towers fell when the smoke billowed and rose. Life was uncertain but Randy felt solid.         For three years we hung out going to his shows with his group of ragtag rocker friends. When our leases expired we moved in together. Weekends were spent at his gigs with him firmly in the spotlight.         But when I saw the newspaper ad for teaching English in Japan it struck like a gong. I had been obsessed with Japan since childhood had studied Zen and kanji in college. I needed to explore to claim my own spotlight for a while.         Yet on the plane across the Pacific I watched several old Japanese women do calisthenics near the emergency exit and I suddenly couldnåÛåªt breathe. It hit me: I was going halfway around the world alone. I would be living by myself in Osaka teaching English in a school in the back of a mall. And I knew no one there. Except Mika.         Mika and I became pen pals when I was 7 and her neighbor visited my familyåÛåªs upstate farm. She left with my address and a picture of me with red hair. Two months later I received a letter.         åÛåÏHelloåÛå it read. åÛåÏMy name is Mika.åÛå In her photo she wore long dark braids and a shirt with the English alphabet.         Mika and I wrote letters for 15 years. When I moved to Manhattan I sent her a map of the island with a gold star downtown. åÛåÏI am hereåÛå I wrote.         When I fell for Randy I told Mika how his James Taylor voice serenaded me while he made smooshed grilled cheese and tomato soup in our small kitchen. I described walking along streets with my hand in his oversize pockets.         Now I was moving to her island.         Training with American expats in central Osaka I felt overwhelmed and shy. The company housed me in a studio that looked from the outside like a washing machine. Every morning I woke to fliers for teenage pornography slid under my door like delivery menus. I rode the train to work aware of the other passengers staring at my bright red hair. I began wearing black hats to cover it.         Japan was beautiful but isolating. On my pink cellphone I called Randy daily. When I got his voice mail repeatedly I rationalized: the time difference. Sometimes I called just to hear his recording.         One weekend I took the bullet train past Mount Fuji to meet Mika.         åÛåÏKonnichiwa!åÛå she exclaimed greeting me at the door. I stared at my longtime friend her hair cut short her eyes farther apart in person. We gave each other a silent hug. I knew this girl so deeply yet we could barely communicate. My spoken Japanese boiled down to three phrases: åÛåÏNo fish flakes pleaseåÛå åÛåÏThank youåÛå and åÛåÏWhere is the bathroom?åÛå Mika wrote better English than she spoke.         We sat on tatami mats and smiled at each other. We ate noodley soups and fresh tofu. Mika was dating a businessman. In a photo I pointed to RandyåÛåªs light blue eyes.         After dinner Mika brought out an envelope with all my letters. In my happy 10-year-oldåÛåªs script IåÛåªd written: åÛåÏDear Mika I have a dog too!åÛå How many tiny details weåÛåªd shared.         Back in my washing machine apartment I could get free Wi-Fi if I placed my laptop on the windowsill overlooking clotheslines. When Randy and I exchanged instant messages I felt anchored.

The report found that by virtually all measures of cost access to care and ease of dealing with insurance problems Americans fared poorly compared with people in other advanced countries. The survey covered 20000 adults in the United States and 10 other industrial nations åÛåÓ Australia Canada France Germany the Netherlands New Zealand Norway Sweden Switzerland and Britain all of which put in place universal or near-universal health coverage decades ago. The United States spends far more than any of these countries on a per capita basis and as a percent of the national economy.         For that it gets meager results. Some 37 percent of American adults went without recommended care did not see a doctor when sick or failed to fill prescriptions in the past year because of costs compared with 4 percent in Britain and 6 percent in Sweden. Nearly a quarter of American adults could not pay medical bills or had serious problems paying them compared with less than 13 percent in France and 7 percent or less in five other countries. Even Americans who were insured for the entire year were more likely than adults abroad to forgo care because of costs an indication of how skimpy some insurance policies are.         When Americans got sick they had to wait longer than people in most of the other countries to get help. Fewer than half were able to get same-day or next-day appointments with a doctor or nurse; one in four had to wait six days or longer. (Only Canada fared worse on both counts.) But Americans got quicker access to specialists than adults in all but two other countries.         The complexity of the American insurance system is also an issue. Some 32 percent of consumers spent a lot of time on insurance paperwork or in disputes with their insurer over denials of payment for services they thought were covered.         The Affordable Care Act was created to address these problems by covering tens of millions of uninsured people and providing subsidies to help many of them pay for policies; by setting limits on the out-of-pocket costs that patients must bear; and by requiring that all policies cover specified benefits.         Americans are understandably frustrated with the Obama administrationåÛåªs failure to produce a functioning website. President ObamaåÛåªs erroneous statements that all people who like their current insurance policies can keep them åÛåÓ not true for many people buying insurance in the individual market åÛåÓ has added to anger and misunderstanding. The reform law however imperfect is needed to bring the dysfunctional American health care system up to levels already achieved in other advanced nations.

In my case it started with a visit from my old friend the activist. The activist became my patient back in the mid-1990s when H.I.V. was slowly morphing into a treatable disease. He was young then with a mop of dark curls ‰ÛÓ excitable suspicious and frantic about his health. He was convinced the new drugs were pure synthetic poison a profiteering scam by the government and Big Pharma. He was also feeling sick enough that he thought he might just give them a try. He lurched back and forth between these two incompatible positions once or twice a month dragging me and my prescription pad behind him in a flurry of abandoned amber plastic bottles. Eventually though good sense kicked in and he had to admit that on meds he felt a lot better than otherwise. He managed to retain his contempt for the system while regularly filling his prescriptions. I no longer winced at his name on my schedule. And now it is suddenly decades later his H.I.V. has long been perfectly controlled and he is still fomenting revolution. He used to march and holler; now he works social media with a miserable old desktop computer that keeps breaking down. As it happens about a week before one of our infrequent appointments ‰ÛÓ he barely needs me any more ‰ÛÓ I had treated myself to a brand new laptop sending an old perfectly good model into the back of the closet. Of course I wiped its hard drive clean and gave it to him ‰ÛÓ for he is my old friend. But (also of course) we met furtively in a back corridor and I carefully concealed the contraband in a nest of old grocery bags ‰ÛÓ for he is my patient and gifts to patients ‰Û_well we don‰Ûªt usually do that. Once again apparently we were dealing with two incompatible positions. Everyone knows that professional boundaries guide all medical activity in hospital office and clinic. But aside from indisputable sexual and financial depredations no one agrees exactly where these boundaries lie. Kindness to friend and duty to patient: Are they one and the same? Or separated by a barbed-wire fence? Opinion is all over the map. At one extreme is the position probably best articulated by one of medicine‰Ûªs great clinician-scientists Dr. Donald Seldin of the University of Texas. In a 1981 talk to an audience of physicians Dr. Seldin deplored ‰ÛÏa tendency to construe all sorts of human problems as medical problems‰Û and thus within doctors‰Ûª duty and purview to fix. If it isn‰Ûªt ‰ÛÏrelief of pain prevention of disability and postponement of death‰Û Dr. Seldin said why then doctor leave it alone! He got a  standing ovation . In the opposite corner stands Dr. Gordon Schiff of Harvard‰Ûªs Brigham and Women‰Ûªs Hospital who was issued an official reprimand a few years ago for egregious boundary crossing. The incident that it set it off: Dr. Schiff (now 63 an experienced senior clinician) had tangled with an insurer on the phone for two hours before he gave up and handed an impoverished patient $30 to pay for her pain pills. A resident observed the transaction and turned him in. But Dr. Schiff is a proud repeat offender whose past infractions include helping patients get jobs giving them jobs himself offering them rides home extending the occasional dinner invitation and yes once handing over a computer. He was told physicians should stay away from ‰ÛÏrandom acts of kindness‰Û ‰ÛÓ an activity that may sound harmless but is quite distinct from the practice of medicine and has its risks. Patients might get too familiar expect too much. Dr. Schiff  published  a long rumination about the incident a few months ago (which he reported in an interview has elicited the email equivalent of a standing ovation). In it he considers whom exactly the sanctions against befriending patients are designed to protect. The patient in some instances he concludes but the doctor in far more. ‰ÛÏLet‰Ûªs not pretend we are imposing limits for patients rather than our own best interests.‰Û Dr. Schiff draws medicine‰Ûªs borders around a shared social agenda: doctors help the patient‰Ûªs health by helping the whole patient. Dr. Seldin‰Ûªs borders contain specific technical tasks. If you think too superficially about all of this you may begin to hear Dr. Seldin screeching like Ebenezer Scrooge: Are there no charities? Are there no social workers? But it‰Ûªs not quite that simple. I too handed out the odd $20 bill at work without thinking much about it until I didn‰Ûªt see one patient for almost a full year afterward ‰ÛÓ and she was a sick person who really needed care. What had happened? ‰ÛÏI couldn‰Ûªt come back without your money‰Û she said. So that was a random act of blindness on my part good evidence of the perils of the terrain and the need to think before each step. I think ‰ÛÓ I hope ‰ÛÓ the activist and I understand each other a little better than that. Dr. Abigail Zuger on the everyday ethical issues doctors face.

More than 60 years after the debut of  åÛåÏWaiting for GodotåÛå  BeckettåÛåªs absurdist drama about two vagabonds anticipating a mysterious savior there is much disagreement among directors actors critics and scholars on how the name of that elusive title figure should be spoken.         åÛåÏGOD-ohåÛå with the accent on the first syllable is how åÛåÏit should be pronouncedåÛå said Sean Mathias the British director of  the latest a Broadway revival  of åÛåÏWaiting for GodotåÛå opening later this month at the Cort Theater.         åÛåÏIt has to be reallyåÛå he said. åÛåÏThereåÛåªs no other way to do it.åÛå         But the theater critic John Lahr said that rendering åÛåÏis too obviousåÛå for the playwright  Samuel Beckett  with its suggestion of the Almighty.         åÛåÏBeckett is more elusive and poetic and he wouldnåÛåªt hit it on the head like thatåÛå said Mr. Lahr a longtime contributor to The New Yorker who instead advocates for åÛåÏgod-OHåÛå with the accent on the second syllable.         Georges Borchardt a literary agent who represented Beckett and continues to represent his literary estate suggested even a third pronunciation was possible.         åÛåÏI myself have always pronounced it the French way with equal emphasis on both syllablesåÛå Mr. Borchardt said in an email.         Mr. Borchardt said he had consulted with Edward Beckett a nephew of the author who told him that his uncle pronounced it the same way and that Edward Beckett could not see åÛåÏwhy there should be a correct or incorrect way of pronouncing Godot.åÛå         åÛåÏAs the agents for the estateåÛå Mr. Borchardt continued åÛåÏwe do not insist on any particular pronunciation.åÛå         There seems to be nothing to be done to reconcile these competing camps and productions of åÛåÏGodotåÛå do what they will.  In a video recording  Peter Hall who directed the first British production in 1955 pronounces it GOD-oh.  An American television production  from 1961 starring Burgess Meredith and Zero Mostel uses åÛåÏgod-OH.åÛå Discussing his role in the 2009 Broadway production  Nathan Lane says  åÛåÏGOD-oh.åÛå         åÛåÏI donåÛåªt think there is a mathematical solution to this problemåÛå said Mark Nixon the director of the  Beckett International Foundation  at the University of Reading in England.         Dr. Nixon said he believed the name was correctly pronounced with a stressed first syllable. But he said åÛåÏI donåÛåªt feel strongly in the sense that I would correct somebody who said it differently.åÛå         Still he did not dismiss the Godot question as a trivial issue. åÛåÏNothingåÛåªs trivial when it comes to BeckettåÛå he said.         The debate would surely please Beckett an Irish author who originally wrote åÛåÏWaiting for GodotåÛå in French before translating it into English and whose work embraced ambiguity and resisted easy interpretation. As this Nobel laureate wrote åÛåÏno symbols where none intendedåÛå but he kept his intentions mysterious and seemed to leave symbols everywhere. The pronunciation of Godot like the name itself seems pregnant with meaning yet ambiguous.         One might think that BeckettåÛåªs own writing would plainly reveal his wishes but gosh no.         According to åÛåÏThe Theatrical Notebooks of Samuel BeckettåÛå (Grove Press) when åÛåÏWaiting for GodotåÛå was performed in the 1980s by the San Quentin Drama Workshop Beckett sought åÛåÏto counter the natural American tendency to stress the second syllableåÛå and asked his actors åÛåÏconsciously to pronounce it with the stress on the first syllable instead.åÛå         Dr. Nixon said that recordings of the authoråÛåªs voice are extremely rare åÛåÓ åÛåÏonly about four or four and a half are in existence.åÛå         åÛåÏIåÛåªve heard all of themåÛå Dr. Nixon said åÛåÏand on none of those recordings does he use the word Godot. So unfortunately thatåÛåªs not a route we can take.åÛå         The French-looking name Godot may seem to call for a French pronunciation. But in an English-language production speaking Godot without stressing either syllable åÛåÏwould be similar to saying åÛå÷PareeåÛåª for ParisåÛå explained the actor Adrian Dunbar an experienced Beckett performer.         åÛåÏAlthough not incorrectåÛå he said åÛåÏit does sound a little shall we say faux.åÛå         There is no definitive origin story for the name Godot either. It may be BeckettåÛåªs reference to the French bicyclist Roger Godeau or to French slang words for boots a pair of which feature prominently in the play.         Mr. Lahr rejected the interpretation that Godot was simply a stand-in for God an idea he said was too easily conjured up by the pronunciation GOD-oh.         When his father the actor Bert Lahr played Estragon in  the original American productions  of åÛåÏWaiting for GodotåÛå Mr. Lahr said åÛåÏgod-OHåÛå was used.         åÛåÏIt keeps it open-ended and more painful almost as if thereåÛåªs nothing out thereåÛå Mr. Lahr said. åÛåÏWhich there isnåÛåªt in BeckettåÛåªs vision.åÛå         And for American ears the GOD-oh pronunciation can sound affected and can take some getting used to.         Mr. Mathias whose production of åÛåÏWaiting for GodotåÛå was originally staged  in the West End of London  said that when it transferred to New York åÛåÏwe had to train everybodyåÛå to embrace this pronunciation.         åÛåÏCould you imagine the poor crew?åÛå Mr. Mathias asked cheekily. åÛåÏAnybody who says åÛå÷god-OHåÛåª I say åÛå÷Excuse me? WhatåÛåªs that? WeåÛåªre not doing that play.åÛåª Poor things.åÛå         Shane Baker who translated åÛåÏWaiting for GodotåÛå  into Yiddish  said that actors in this version of the play said åÛåÏgod-OHåÛå because åÛåÏthatåÛåªs how itåÛåªs known in America.åÛå         åÛåÏI was the translatoråÛå said Mr. Baker who also played Vladimir in the New Yiddish Rep production at the Castillo Theater in Manhattan. åÛåÏBut the producer and director wanted god-OH so there you have it.åÛå         åÛåÏWe did it wrongåÛå he said. åÛåÏLook I had other battles I had to fight.åÛå         Mr. Baker added that over the years åÛåÏWaiting for GodotåÛå had become part of åÛåÏthe peopleåÛåªs imagination.åÛå It has been paid tribute in films like åÛåÏWaiting for GuffmanåÛå and the subject of a åÛåÏSesame StreetåÛå parody  åÛåÏWaiting for Elmo.åÛå   Saying åÛåÏgod-OHåÛå he said has become part of the vernacular and it is too late to talk audiences out of it.         åÛåÏThe rest of the play is jarring enoughåÛå Mr. Baker said. åÛåÏWhy upset them?åÛå

Far fewer musicians of any age will have played the famous conclusion in the manner that the conductor  Benjamin Zander  molded it during a concert by the  Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra  at Carnegie Hall on Monday evening.         Mr. Zander also an admired pedagogue and motivational speaker is renowned for coaxing professional-quality work from amateurs and for wringing fresh insights from even the most familiar works. Both characteristics surfaced during the New York debut of this ensemble established last year as an offshoot of Mr. ZanderåÛåªs admired Boston Philharmonic Orchestra. The members of the youth orchestra ages 12 to 21 play with a maturity and cohesion well beyond their years a point made in numerous  audio and video clips  on the ensembleåÛåªs web page.         In the Shostakovich especially the finale Mr. Zander is a stickler for the composeråÛåªs tempo markings and note values as indicative of the expressive intent. The movement starts at 88 to the eighth note mounts to a feverish 184 then retreats back to 92 åÛåÓ at which point notes double in length. Thus the ostensibly triumphal coda Mr. Zander explained before the performance is meant to sound beaten down and labored: points missed outright even in benchmark interpretations.         Here those qualities were enacted convincingly at the close of a brilliantly played fervently felt account enriched with silken strings robust brass and eloquent solos by the principal winds and the concertmaster Max Tan.         By then the orchestraåÛåªs acumen and poise had been firmly established in a precise exuberant rendition of VerdiåÛåªs overture to åÛåÏLa Forza del DestinoåÛå and two coruscating movements from Michael GandolfiåÛåªs åÛåÏGarden of Cosmic Speculation.åÛå  Christopher OåÛåªRiley  a former student of Mr. ZanderåÛåªs was the stylish soloist in a luscious account of RavelåÛåªs Piano Concerto in G with haunting work from Nicole Caligiuri on English horn in the Adagio.         Whoops whistles and flash bulbs at the end attested to an abundance of family and friends in the audience but the concert was one that any music lover would savor.

Orr the man who must now revive Detroit commutes each week from Maryland to a cavernous old office building here that seems to dare him to succeed: the former headquarters of a company itself recently in bankruptcy that once sold more than half of AmericaåÛåªs cars åÛåÓ General Motors.         His office on the 14th floor is sparsely furnished but in the stack of papers on his desk he keeps a few photographs åÛåÓ of New York City at its financial low in the 1970s. Gritty streets that look he says like some of DetroitåÛåªs unlit forgotten neighborhoods today.         åÛåÏAnytime somebody says it canåÛåªt happen I whip those pictures out and say åÛå÷Oh donåÛåªt you bet against itåÛåªÌâåÊåÛå Mr. Orr said the other day not long after a federal judge allowed Detroit to become the  nationåÛåªs largest city ever to enter bankruptcy . åÛåÏLet me show you what can happen.åÛå         Mr. Orr 55 who has never run for political office finds himself in an extraordinary role. He holds power even more concentrated than that of the emergency control board that intervened when  New York City was teetering near bankruptcy  an  unelected lawyer chiefly responsible for the reinvention of a major American city  in decay. And thereåÛåªs a deadline åÛåÓ 10 months.         The assignment is enormous a peculiar mix of duties some stated and others not for a man who by all accounts had been leading a comfortable life as a bankruptcy lawyer. His new job? Urban planner numbers cruncher city spokesman negotiator politician good cop bad cop.         The job could not be more politically fraught. Mr. OrråÛåªs harshest critics call him a åÛåÏdictatoråÛå (his authority trumps that of the cityåÛåªs elected leaders) an åÛåÏUncle TomåÛå (he is black and was sent to run this mostly black city by a white governor) and a åÛåÏpension killeråÛå (he has said the  city can no longer afford the pensions  it promised retirees). But Mr. Orr who was a partner at the law firm Jones Day until his wife and a mentor helped talk him into taking the Detroit job seems unfazed by the storm around him. He is full of smiles and quips coolly pressing on.         åÛåÏIf we donåÛåªt do something to address the unfunded liability that we have the 700000 residents åÛåÓ some of them schoolchildren some of them sort of skinny dorky kids like I was who got beaten up every day at the bus stop by the toughs who have to walk home in the dark åÛåÓ donåÛåªt they deserve better services?åÛå said Mr. Orr who grew up in Florida and visited Detroit as a youth. åÛåÏThere has to be some balance here. This is our chance.åÛå         This year with DetroitåÛåªs financial troubles becoming desperately apparent Gov. Rick Snyder a Republican called on Mr. Orr who had worked on ChrysleråÛåªs bankruptcy and at  the Resolution Trust Corporation  to be sent as an emergency manager with sweeping powers.         At first Mr. Orr said he resisted. The salary $275000 a year from the state would be a pay cut. His wife who is a physician would be caring for their two children 6 and 7 at home in Chevy Chase Md. when he was in Detroit. And the circumstances were certain to be volatile in a city that was hardly asking for an outsider to step in. Ultimately Mr. Orr said he became convinced that it was a call to action.         In the nearly nine months since Mr. Orr has been continually on the move meeting with community groups issuing reports filing for bankruptcy firing and hiring people at City Hall.         His supporters say he is astute and charming but also direct. åÛåÏThe thing is his stock is as high today as it was when he walked in the dooråÛå said Sandy K. Baruah the president of the Detroit Regional Chamber.         But he has also been a target during protests. Detroiters groaned at the attitude they perceived in  a comment he made  to The Wall Street Journal: åÛåÏFor a long time the city was dumb lazy happy and rich.åÛå Mr. Orr has said it was in no way meant as an insult against contemporary Detroiters but an observation about circumstances 100 years ago.         And DetroitåÛåªs mayor Dave Bing who is leaving office at the end of the year has said Mr. Orr arrived in the municipal building (where Mr. Orr has a second office not far from Mr. BingåÛåªs) with a slew of outside consultants and personnel changes but precious little expertise in running a city.         åÛåÏKevyn has tried to take on way too muchåÛå Mr. Bing said in an interview adding that he doubted speculation that the  incoming mayor Mike Duggan  might get some larger role. åÛåÏWhoever the mayor is and the City Council are they wonåÛåªt have a say in how to run the city.åÛå         Some critics bristle at the suggestion that Mr. Orr åÛåÓ rather than Governor Snyder and the Republican majority in the state capital Lansing åÛåÓ is running this city where tensions over race and class have long simmered. Mr. Orr and Governor Snyder both attended law school in overlapping years at the University of Michigan where Mr. Orr had also gotten his undergraduate degree. The two meet and talk regularly the governoråÛåªs spokeswoman said. Mr. Orr stays in a condominium at the Westin Book Cadillac  that has been paid for by a tax-exempt fund  the governor created.         åÛåÏThey pull the levers and he reads the script at the press conferencesåÛå said the Rev. Charles Williams II of the  National Action Network . åÛåÏIn our community we call that window dressing.åÛå         Mr. Orr has heard it all before; mainly he dismisses it. He says that he is a Democrat and has never voted for a Republican and that Governor Snyder was a åÛåÏfleeting acquaintanceåÛå in law school.         And however his life may appear to others åÛåÓ the classic suits and the state police security detail åÛåÓ Mr. Orr says simply that he sees himself as a part of Detroit. In the cityåÛåªs churches he says he smells the Florida church his grandfather led the old Bibles and the organs. Both his grandmothers had studied to the eighth grade and worked as maids.         åÛåÏWhen I say åÛå÷IåÛåªm themåÛåªÌâåÊåÛå Mr. Orr said of Detroiters åÛåÏI want people to understand donåÛåªt look at who I am now. I have by no means forgotten.åÛå         On the most contentious issues Mr. Orr has held hard lines. He refuses to promise that works at the  Detroit Institute of Arts  will go untouched in bankruptcy. He says city pensions for retirees are unaffordable as they are now despite state constitutional protections.         Not long ago Mr. OrråÛåªs mother a retired school administrator from Florida who receives a pension met a Detroit retiree at a conference. åÛåÏThey were crying togetheråÛå Mr. Orr said. åÛåÏShe said åÛå÷Kevyn do you have to do this?åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå         åÛåÏIf we donåÛåªt do something in the next 10 or 12 yearsåÛå Mr. Orr said åÛåÏthere wonåÛåªt be pensions for the 30- 40- and 50-year olds. Is that fair?åÛå         Mr. Orr has cleared one of his biggest hurdles: getting approval for bankruptcy. Though he is more accustomed to asking questions in courtrooms he spent days testifying about DetroitåÛåªs dismal conditions providing a pivotal basis for the judgeåÛåªs determination.         But the trial also shed light on his tactics in  filing for bankruptcy . Judge Steven W. Rhodes found that Mr. Orr and his team had not bargained in good faith before heading to court (though the judge also found that bargaining would have been impracticable given the some 100000 creditors). In one testy exchange the judge asked Mr. Orr about a statement he had made at a town-hall-style meeting in June that pensions were åÛåÏsacrosanct.åÛå         åÛåÏWhat would you say to that retiree now?åÛå the judge asked.         åÛåÏI would say his rights are subject to the supremacy clause in the U.S. ConstitutionåÛå Mr. Orr said.         åÛåÏThatåÛåªs a little bit different than sacrosanct isnåÛåªt it?åÛå         By next October åÛåÓ when under state law DetroitåÛåªs elected leaders can remove Mr. Orr åÛåÓ he hopes the city will have emerged from court with eased debts and reinvestment in services from streetlights to garbage pickup.         It is a tall order. He expects a new agency to put thousands of streetlights on key roads and near bus stops. He wants a remade police department åÛåÓ he has already hired a new chief åÛåÓ to drive down crime. He wants a åÛåÏsuperchargedåÛå effort to remove tens of thousands of abandoned buildings.         åÛåÏIn three years hopefully the blight is goneåÛå Mr. Orr said. åÛåÏThat would be my dream.åÛå

The airbridge using Ilyushin-76 commercial cargo planes flying to Hassakeh from Arbil in northern Iraq will begin on Thursday. Up to 12 flights are scheduled through Sunday said Amin Awad director of the U.N. refugee agency's Middle East and North Africa Bureau.         Elisabeth Byrs a spokeswoman for the U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP) later said that it also planned 10 rotations over the next 10 days in an operation aimed at feeding more than 30000 people for a month. Its first flight would carry 40 metric tons of food including wheat flour pasta oil sugar salt rice canned beans and bulgur wheat she said.         U.N. agencies have ferried limited aid supplies into Syria from Iraq and Lebanon but not via Turkey because of objections from President Bashar al-Assad's government.         ""This is the first time aid goes through Iraq"" Awad told Reuters in an interview in Geneva.         Syria gave permission about two weeks ago for the cross-border U.N. operation from Iraq into Syrian Kurdish areas of Hassakeh province which had initially envisaged truck convoys via the Yarubiya border crossing a cheaper option he said.         ""As the situation was very complicated negotiating with many factions we shifted to an airlift"" Awad said noting that one main Kurdish group in the area was pro-Syrian government and the other pro-Turkish.         The previously unannounced joint UNHCR-WFP operation had been long planned by land a Western diplomat said. ""They had trucks and were ready to move a week ago. It was supposed to be over this past weekend but it didn't happen"" he told Reuters.         The cities of Hassakeh and Qamishli are to receive food and relief items as a harsh winter sets in Awad said.         ""OUT OF REACH FOR A LONG TIME""         The total cargo of 285 metric tons to be brought in by the U.N. refugee agency will also include blankets kitchen sets plastic tarpaulins for shelter sleeping mats and jerry cans UNHCR spokesman Dan McNorton said.         ""The number of vulnerable people in Hassakeh is estimated at 50000-60000 but we are still doing assessments. Hassakeh has been out of reach for a long time"" Awad said.         Awad said the United Nations was still ""lining up airlines that are willing to fly into that part of the country"".         Well over 100000 people have been killed in the conflict in Syria which began with peaceful protests against Assad in March 2011. The UNHCR says about 6.5 million people have fled their homes within Syria and 2.3 million sought refuge abroad.         ""Winter is here. This is one of the harshest winters according to any forecast that you may get hold of probably in the last 100 years"" Awad told a news briefing.         Iraq's envoy to the U.N.

Wherever she appears though the sight of a burly man compressed in a curve-hugging mermaid gown rarely fails to elicit in audiences a queasy mix of empathy and raucous laughter.         It does even now as a new crop of cross-dressing Broadway and Hollywood stars injects this venerable genre with currency and a jolt of fresh vitality.         While the catalog of indelible performances then and now is far too extensive to cite in a breath (much less memorialize in a few column inches) the vivid handful enshrined in peopleåÛåªs consciousness surely has to include that of  Tony Curtis  tricked out as a demure and surprisingly pretty chanteuse fleeing mobsters an equally dainty  Jack Lemmon  at his side in the 1959  Billy Wilder  hit  åÛåÏSome Like It Hot.åÛå  At the other extreme is Divine in the 1972 landmark John Waters film åÛåÏPink FlamingosåÛå her lavish contours encased in scarlet her only accessories Mephistophelian eyebrows chandelier earrings åÛåÓ and a gun.         Such impersonations can be broken down roughly into three subgroups: the winsome sylph the brazen diva (all whiskey contralto and vulcanized curves) and the genteel matron.         This last a bosomy archetype was persuasively embodied by  Dustin Hoffman  as the coyly bespectacled title character in  åÛåÏTootsieåÛå  (1982) and by the cardigan-shrouded  Robin Williams  a.k.a.  Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire  in 1993. To say nothing of Madea the portly invention of a cross-dressing Tyler Perry who made her film debut in  åÛåÏDiary of a Mad Black WomanåÛå  (2005) trussed in a fat suit and toting a massive poitrine. (She returns in a sequel next month.)         The pantheon of divas varies from those lustily portrayed by  Harvey Fierstein  the doyenne of drag who in April will bring to Broadway åÛåÏCasa ValentinaåÛå about a 1960s vacation retreat where straight men dress as women; to Gene Hackman wearing a candy-floss wig and sprouting chest hair in the 1996 movie  åÛåÏThe BirdcageåÛå ; to John Cameron Mitchell a stringier type tossing her yellow curls off Broadway and on the big screen in  åÛåÏHedwig and the Angry InchåÛå  her exposed rib cage giving her a touch of sylphlike vulnerability.         More often than not though the true sylph captures a poignancy rarely conveyed by her bombshell sisters. Consider Jaye Davidson Dil in  åÛåÏThe Crying GameåÛå  (1992) who seems achingly fragile even in a boyish crop and beefy cricket sweater.         Or  Jared Leto  the latest though hardly least impactful of cinematic sylphs as the wraithlike Rayon in the based-on-real-events movie  åÛåÏDallas Buyers Club.åÛå  (åÛåÏLean and beautiful he wears heels and furs wellåÛå  wrote  the New Yorker reviewer David Denby.)         Mr. LetoåÛåªs screen transformation åÛåÓ requiring shaved legs dollops of lip gloss and generous dustings of powder åÛåÓ has made him a contender  for an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor .

If the sylph brings to her character a deeply intuited femininity it most often stops short of authentic womanliness.         But then miming reality well thatåÛåªs never really been the point.         Here is a fresh look at some of the best in the genre then and now:          Jared Leto   Who would have thought that Jared Leto could look so disarmingly pretty in pink? The blush-tinted robe in which he makes his entrance as Rayon the H.I.V.-positive transsexual in åÛåÏDallas Buyers ClubåÛå is a backdrop of sorts against which he shows off his precision-lined eyes Camille-like pallor and carmine tinted nails. At one point in the drama Mr. Leto a fashion chameleon trades his headwrap chicly knotted at the rear for a headful of curls and a succession of trailer-park-inspired frocks. Wearing one such pansy-patterned number he asks fretfully: åÛåÏDo you like this dress? Because I think the neckline is a little plunging.åÛå That may be. But cut to the sternum it somehow brings out his wispy femininity.          Mark Rylance   Mark Rylance as Countess Olivia in the current Broadway production of åÛåÏTwelfth NightåÛå isnåÛåªt delivering a drag performance not in the strictest terms (he plays the lady straight; you accept her as a woman). But trussed in a jet-colored heavily boned gown and starchy ruff he exudes a kind of regal glamour his rigorously elegant costume likely to inspire a flurry of look-alikes on the runways next year. His is an austere beauty for sure the sort that deserves its own frame. And itåÛåªs only enhanced by a face thickly dusted in arsenic-white powder and a gliding gait åÛåÓ a walk borrowed equally it seems from Kabuki and the Ice Capades.          Jaye Davidson   åÛåÏA bit heavy on the powder isnåÛåªt she?åÛå a catty visitor says of Dil the transgender love interest in "" The Crying Game.åÛå To which Dil ( Jaye Davidson) retorts without missing a beat åÛåÏA girl has to have a bit of glamour.åÛå Glamour is a quality Dil projects emphatically from her voice a steamy tenor and gazellelike neck to a pair of stems that seem born to stride the most rarefied catwalks. Mauve-tinted eye shadow and a gender-bending wardrobe of glittery dresses frayed denim shorts and a racy vinyl trench do their part as well in supplying her uncanny allure. Among the filmåÛåªs ironies is that even in an outsize cricket sweater Dil seems more authentically feminine than Jude her vixenish archnemesis an actual woman who could pass for a travesty in a Mugler suit and bangs.

Not mind you because the websiteåÛåªs flaws have all been wiped away or because the pace of enrollment is where the White House wanted it to be or because the political backlash over plan cancellations has disappeared. The site may be better the  enrollment pace higher  the backlash no longer front-page news åÛåÓ but the lawåÛåªs rollout is by any reasonable definition still a dreadful mess.         But a worst-case scenario in which the website remained unusable well into the new year seems to have been averted and with it the danger that insurers or Congressional Democrats would begin to bail on Obamacare entirely.         And liberals have apparently decided that just  getting things moving  in the  right direction  makes  all the difference . Sure problems persist crucial errors remain and confusion probably looms for some customers and insurers in January when policies are supposed to take effect. But  errors  can be fixed money  sluiced around  more temporary changes made. The important thing is there will be no immediate political unraveling ... which means that enrollment will keep rising ... which means that by 2016 Obamacare will be a locked-in impossible-to-repeal feature of the American landscape.         This holds true liberals have begun telling themselves even if the lawåÛåªs disruptions cost Democrats dearly in the 2014 midterms. Because a working website will give the White House åÛåÏthree full years to create millions and perhaps tens of millions of winners who are getting insurance or protectionåÛå The Washington PoståÛåªs Ezra Klein wrote last week Democrats can åÛåÏlose on the politics in the midterm election even as they win on the policy in the long term.åÛå         The entrenchment hypothesis is  plausible . But it elides one crucial problem: the extent to which the successful implementation of Obamacare actuallyÌâåÊ depends ÌâåÊon the lawåÛåªs political standing.ÌâåÊ         ThatåÛåªs because the law can work only if people who donåÛåªt necessarily benefit immediately from its provisions decide to participate anyway. If they respond to higher premiums by either staying out or dropping out then Obamacare will be permanently unstable: the dollar figures both for insurers and the government simply wonåÛåªt add up.         The participation of the young and healthy is supposed to be required of course by the individual mandate. But the mandateåÛåªs penalty is relatively modest and its enforcement mechanisms relatively weak which means its power ultimately depends more on civic duty than on immediate self-interest.         The lawåÛåªs advocates have explicitly acknowledged this point. Explaining the case for the mandate last month The AtlanticåÛåªs Matt OåÛåªBrien allowed that åÛåÏ a rational self-maximizer åÛå might decide to pay the fine instead of buying costly coverage. But åÛåÏreal peopleåÛå he argued åÛåÏarenåÛåªt rational self-maximizers ... We donåÛåªt like to feel like weåÛåªre doing the wrong thing. We like to follow the rules instead. Feel like weåÛåªre a good person.åÛå         The experience of Mitt RomneyåÛåªs Massachusetts OåÛåªBrien concluded shows how this works: enrollment in Romneycare spiked when the mandate kicked in and it spiked for healthy people åÛåÓ presumably because they accepted the åÛåÏpositive responsibilityåÛå of the mandate and bought health insurance because itåÛåªs what they were åÛåÏsupposed to do.åÛå         But this example does not necessarily bode well for ObamacareåÛåªs unfolding. The Massachusetts law was a bipartisan bill passed in a wealthy homogeneous state with a pervasive left-liberal ethos. The national health care law aspires to create the same sense of åÛåÏpositive responsibilityåÛå in a much more polarized fragmented socioeconomically diverse and libertarian-minded society roughly half of which opposes the law outright.         This was always going to be a lift even without technological problems and åÛåÏif you like your plan you can keep your planåÛå disillusionment. Now itåÛåªs much much heavier.         Consider the  findings  of a new poll from HarvardåÛåªs Institute of Politics. Among the traditionally pro-Obama millennial generation the core group that the White House needs to åÛåÏfollow the rulesåÛå and buy a policy the presidentåÛåªs approval ratings have dropped to 41 percent and support for Obamacare has also plunged: 56 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds disapprove of the law a majority say it will increase costs and just 18 percent say it will improve their care. Meanwhile a new National Journal  survey  finds that a majority of millennials expect the law to be repealed outright.         Those are not numbers that suggest a population thatåÛåªs poised to fall in line do its civic duty and feel warm and fuzzy in the process. Rather they suggest that the political emotions stirred up by the rollout åÛåÓ frustration disillusionment anger åÛåÓ could have substantial consequences for sign-up rates as well.         åÛåÏIf thereåÛåªs one thing we know how to doåÛå  said a White House official  last spring projecting optimism about Obamacare enrollment åÛåÏitåÛåªs reach young people.åÛå         Now though the fate of their policy may depend on not only reaching them but reconverting them as well.

As Brandt later said åÛåÏCarrying the burden of the millions who were murdered I did what people do when words fail them.åÛå         Such symbolic acts carry enormous importance. They enter the realm of myth by connecting with a human place beyond and before words.  The image from 1970  is riveting a German driven by emotion and conviction to a spontaneous personal gesture toward slaughtered Jews. Other such moments come to mind: Anwar Sadat the Egyptian president  addressing the Knesset in 1977 ; FranÌÄå¤ois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl the French and German leaders  holding hands at Verdun in 1984  in the place where hundreds of thousands of their countrymen died fighting each other in 1916; the enough-of-blood-and-tears handshake between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat  on the White House lawn in 1993  åÛåÓ before more blood was spilled between Israelis and Palestinians (and among them).         And then as if in the image of that failure a blank comes. Our age is not rich in such solemn iconic moments of conciliation or contrition. Perhaps it is that calculation and spin have trumped conviction and so buried the spontaneous in public life. Perhaps it is the obsession with control åÛåÓ and multiplication of means to ensure it åÛåÓ that have made politics more arid. Perhaps it is the postmodern death of political idealism. Or perhaps it is the sheer volume of images that makes it difficult for a single one to define historical shift. The most powerful image of the 21st century remains the planes-turned-missiles hitting the Twin Towers in 2001. Far-flung wars since then have produced no hands outreached in peace no consolation or resolution. Barack Obama focus of dreams has proved a tiptoeing president.         Thinking of Brandt I came here to see his fellow Social Democrat and near-contemporary Helmut Schmidt who became chancellor in 1974 not long after BrandtåÛåªs resignation. Schmidt is 94. During a two-hour conversation he smoked continuously. HeåÛåªs a three-pack-a-day guy has been since he was 15. That would be 60 cigarettes a day for almost 80 years. Rules require exceptions or life would be unlivable.         Schmidt was a strong leader who says he was always sure German unification would happen but did not expect it so soon. åÛåÏWe have Gorbachev and Baker to thank above allåÛå he said citing the former Soviet leader and U.S. secretary of state. åÛåÏMitterrand and Thatcher were clearly against it.åÛå         I asked Schmidt who still works as publisher of the Die Zeit weekly about Chancellor Angela Merkel and the euro crisis. åÛåÏMerkel does not feel the European Union in her heartåÛå he said. åÛåÏWith her rational mind yes she understands its importance. But she lacks helpfulness sympathy and solidarity. There is a lack of solidarity. With a 240 billion euro surplus in its current account Germany has to show more solidarity.åÛå         He continued: åÛåÏShe grew up in East Germany and East German people were looking for freedom not for Europe. And that meant America as for the Poles and Czechs. Freedom trumped Europe. In fact Europe is one step higher than freedom. I tend to think she has stronger feelings about the United States than she does about Europe.åÛå         Schmidt was adamant: åÛåÏGermans have to change approach. We have the largest current account surplus in the world more than China. In the end Germany will have to respond to pressure and spend more. This huge surplus brings a moral necessity.åÛå Debt will have to be forgiven and long-term credits made to help spur Greece and Spain into recovery. åÛåÏThis is comparable to the forgiveness of German debt in the 1950såÛå he said.         The words came through a cloud of smoke accompanied by a glint in his luminous gray-blue eyes åÛåÓ a declarative on-the-record throwback to a time when leaders did not mince words when they were individuals rather than managed commodities. Brandt and Schmidt like Adenauer and Kohl were towering figures compared with todayåÛåªs European pygmies.         I wonder if individual courage in leadership can make a comeback. It is needed. Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli prime minister has just invited Mahmoud Abbas the Palestinian leader to go and speak in the Knesset and said he is ready to go to Ramallah. From a supreme short-term tactician the invitation felt manipulative but still Netanyahu is right. Peace will demand a grand gesture something solemn and symbolic and unspun.         Schmidt speaking of indelible images was born a year after John F. Kennedy. A half-century after the assassination its mystery remains. KennedyåÛåªs words like BrandtåÛåªs genuflection admonish us: åÛåÏToo often we enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.åÛå

Jerry Brown is familiar with his penchant for referring to philosophers Latin or an obscure tome he has recently read often in the same sentence. A speaker who uses what he deems an imprecise word should be prepared to listen to a soliloquy on its meaning.         Do not expect his wife to do the same.         Anne Gust Brown petite and polished speaks with the directness of someone who has little patience for theoretical colloquiums. She is the first person to whom advisers turn if they need to anticipate the long list of questions the governor is likely to pepper them with. After more than 20 years as his partner åÛåÓ and nearly a decade as his top aide åÛåÓ she is one of the few people who can predict his often unpredictable thinking. And she is the one most likely to tell the governor it is time to end the Socratic seminar and make a decision.         åÛåÏI would say sometimes heåÛåªs exhaustingåÛå Ms. Gust Brown said in a courtyard just outside the governoråÛåªs office. åÛåÏSometimes I have to foist him onto other people and say you go talk to someone else about that because he has a sort of insatiable appetite about these things.åÛå         From the first day her husband a Democrat began his  third term as governor in 2011  Ms. Gust Brown has occupied an office just around the corner from his. And as he decides whether to run for re-election next year åÛåÓ as many expect he will åÛåÓ no oneåÛåªs counsel will be more highly valued than hers.         One of the quickest decisions the couple made after he won a governorship he had previously held decades earlier was to eschew the use of the term first lady and give her a different title: special counsel to the governor. She helped run the campaign for a successful ballot measure to raise taxes last fall and has played a key role in amassing Mr. BrownåÛåªs $10 million war chest.         Ms. Gust Brown 55 and a lawyer has not embraced the ceremonial role that governorsåÛåª wives usually play. Instead she functions as a confidante quietly consulting with the governor on matters as expansive as the stateåÛåªs criminal justice system and mundane as hiring and firing staff members. She reads scores of bills each year helping sort through countless legal and political implications the legislation may have.         åÛåÏI figure out what needs additional hands and do thatåÛå Ms. Gust Brown said in the recent interview one of few she has given since her husband took office. Sitting in the courtyard where former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger once kept his  smoking tent  she rubbed the ears of  Sutter  the BrownsåÛåª dog a corgi who is more widely recognized in the capital than she is.         Ms. Gust Brown does not have her own staff or policy priorities. She shelved the long tradition of a governor-sponsored conference on women which had been a prominent part of the job for her predecessors. (Particularly for Maria Shriver who like Ms. Gust Brown had left her own successful career when her husband ascended into office.) Friends describe Ms. Gust Brown as someone who shuns formality; she has been known to make an off-color joke on a staff call or wear jeans to the office. But few think that her casual demeanor means she should not be taken seriously.         While she described åÛåÏlittle droppingsåÛå of thick books her husband leaves strewn around the house she said she had been too wrapped up in reading legislative bills to spend much time on anything else.         åÛåÏThatåÛåªs what weåÛåªre debating from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep and sometimes heåÛåªs waking me up in the middle of the nightåÛå Ms. Gust Brown said. åÛåÏHe doesnåÛåªt have hobbies.åÛå         åÛåÏMy husband thinks about this all the timeåÛå she said drawing out the last three words with a mock exasperation.         For much of her career Ms. Gust Brown worked as a top lawyer for the Gap the San Francisco-based clothing giant. After a mutual friend introduced her to Mr. Brown then several years past his first two terms as governor and his first failed presidential bid the two dated for over a decade before they married in 2005. Several friends worried aloud that if he did not propose Ms. Gust Brown would leave.         åÛåÏI wrote him a letter saying youåÛåªre going to be old sick and alone someday because Anne is not going to put up with this and there is nobody that is better for you than heråÛå said Senator Dianne Feinstein a Democrat who is a longtime friend of the governor. åÛåÏThe next Easter Sunday he called me and said åÛå÷WeåÛåªre engaged would you marry us?' åÛå She did.         Mr. Brown who is 20 years older than his wife planned an elaborate wedding with nearly 600 guests writing the vows and arranging for a custom-designed dress for her.

In the absurdly enjoyable revivals of  Harold Pinter åÛåªs åÛåÏNo ManåÛåªs LandåÛå and  Samuel Beckett åÛåªs åÛåÏWaiting for GodotåÛå which opened in repertory on Sunday at the  Cort Theater  Ian McKellen and  Patrick Stewart  make a most persuasive case for conversation as both the liveliest and loneliest of arts.                                     Hearing two such lions of the British stage (who also happen to be knights of the realm and  franchise action-film stars ) swapping dialogue so dexterously you may find yourself wishing that you could sound just like them. Well the good and the bad news is that you more or less do.                                     Granted we average citizens of this planet are seldom if ever as epigrammatic as the blokes portrayed by Mr. McKellen and Mr. Stewart åÛåÓ a couple of swells on the one hand and a couple of bums on the other (though which hand is which is open to debate). But listen closely åÛåÓ and you will åÛåÓ and youåÛåªll become aware of the blaring S.O.S. that weaves its way through everything they say.                                     They are speaking like you and me to fill a void to pass the hours to assert their identities to pretend that theyåÛåªre truly connected to someone anyone else. Making noise is what they do to keep out the silence thatåÛåªs waiting to step in and devour them. Of course they like to hear themselves talk. ItåÛåªs how they make sure theyåÛåªre alive.                                     Brrrr sounds bleak doesnåÛåªt it? But as directed by Sean Mathias with sturdy supporting performances by Billy Crudup and Shuler Hensley these productions find the pure entertainment value in existential emptiness. I have never before heard American audiences respond to any production of  Pinter  or  Beckett  with such warm and embracing laughter.                                     This isnåÛåªt just a matter of theatergoers chuckling to show that theyåÛåªre smart and cultured and had damn well better be having a good time after forking out all that money for tickets. (If you want to hear that kind of laughter check out the revival of PinteråÛåªs  åÛåÏBetrayalåÛå  a few blocks away.)                                     No watching these tales of aging British poets and woeful French vagabonds the audience is truly in on the joke of how hollow even our most elaborate conversational rituals are. This is largely thanks to two stately showboats who know how to spin arcane philosophical head scratching into remarkably accessible high comedy.                                     Now if youåÛåªll allow me (and it will only sting a second) IåÛåªm going to offer one major caveat regarding two improbably pleasurable shows. Mr. MathiasåÛåªs productions seldom give full value to the deep mortal chill of these plays of the fraught dangers in PinteråÛåªs universe or the aching pathos within BeckettåÛåªs. Ideally you should leave åÛåÏNo ManåÛåªs LandåÛå and åÛåÏGodotåÛå with a shiver as well as a smile.                                     These productions mostly stay comfortably and tantalizingly on the surface. But in doing so they also bring out the beguiling polish and shimmer in Pinter and BeckettåÛåªs language. These shows allow us to appreciate the great paradox in some of the best dialogue ever written which uses eloquence to plumb the futility of speech.                                     Only the sourest theatergoers will begrudge themselves the joy that Mr. McKellen and Mr. Stewart derive and impart from embodying this contradiction. These shows are an irresistible celebration of two actorsåÛåª love affairs with their scripts. Not that the physical side of things has been neglected.                                     Mr. McKellen in particular not only talks the talk but also walks the walk in both shows with a beautifully pained limp for åÛåÏGodotåÛå and for åÛåÏLandåÛå a sprightly heel-to-toe gait that gives new life to the notion of pussyfooting. He and Mr. Stewart prove equally adroit in executing what might be called tragic pratfalls.                                     In åÛåÏLandåÛå first seen in 1975 with Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud in a National Theater production in London Mr. McKellen plays Spooner a shabby self-styled artiste who finds himself in the baronial digs of Hirst (Mr. Stewart) an eminent man of letters. If the play has a narrative arc it would be that of SpooneråÛåªs trying to ingratiate himself into the employment of his newfound wealthy friend.

Davidson the new senior rabbi of Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan literally works under the watchful eyes of his predecessors. Just outside his office are two rows of oil portraits of past senior rabbis dating back to the 19th century åÛåÓ to the early days of the temple and the Reform Jewish movement.         When he is alone he said it can feel like the paintings are speaking to him asking åÛåÏWhat is your contribution going to be?åÛå         It is a daunting question if also an exciting one. Rabbi Davidson 45 is taking over the oldest Reform congregation in New York City as part of a generational shift in the leadership of some of the cityåÛåªs major Reform institutions.         His formal installation on Friday will come on the heels of an announcement of a change in leadership at another congregation: The board of Central Synagogue in Midtown Manhattan said Thursday that it had recommended Angela W. Buchdahl 41 its senior cantor and the nationåÛåªs first Asian-American rabbi to be the next senior rabbi there.         Temple Emanu-El is a place that prides itself on tradition. It still uses a version of the original Reform prayer book and dresses its clergy in robes. It conceals its choir above the congregation near the organ console at its enormous Fifth Avenue sanctuary so that prayers seem to float from the heavens.         But Rabbi Davidson has already begun making his mark. He broke with an older Reform tradition of not wearing a Jewish skullcap and prayer shawl by wearing them when he began to lead services this summer åÛåÓ resulting in an audible gasp from the congregation. But he also wore his robes in a sign that custom and change could go hand in hand.         After Rabbi Davidson broke the ice other rabbis at Temple Emanu-El started following suit. åÛåÏThis congregation prides itself on being inclusive of gay and lesbian couples intermarried couples and single parentsåÛå Rabbi Davidson said in an interview this week. åÛåÏIt needs to be just as inclusive of people who are comfortable with different types of ritual garb.åÛå         Rabbi Davidson grew up in a rabbinical household åÛåÓ his father Rabbi Jerome K. Davidson is the senior rabbi emeritus of Temple Beth-El of Great Neck N.Y. His last job was senior rabbi of Temple Beth El of Northern Westchester in Chappaqua N.Y. and before that he was an assistant and associate rabbi at Central Synagogue.         The new leader at Central Rabbi Buchdahl was born in South Korea; her mother was a Korean Buddhist and her father was an American Reform Jew. She was raised Jewish and became a cantor in 1999 and a Reform rabbi in 2001.         Central Synagogue is smaller than Temple Emanu-El but it has been growing in recent years åÛåÓ it now has about 2100 families in its membership and about 300 on a waiting list. Temple Emanu-ElåÛåªs membership has fallen to around 2500 families from roughly 3000. Worship services are less formal at Central often with guitar music and more participation from worshipers. Rabbi Davidson said he would like to try similar åÛåÏalternativeåÛå forms of worship perhaps in Temple Emanu-ElåÛåªs smaller sanctuary.         He also said he would like to start discussion groups and host lectures about subjects like business ethics parenting and the Middle East in addition to the sacred text and history classes the temple already offers. åÛåÏIf this congregation åÛåÓ if any congregation åÛåÓ is going to be successful given the evolving landscape of American JewryåÛå he said åÛåÏwe have to be more things to more people.åÛå         Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is among the prominent members at Temple Emanu-El and the two men met at a dinner. åÛåÏI would hope that he thinks of me as one of his rabbisåÛå Rabbi Davidson said.         At FridayåÛåªs service the speakers will include Rabbi Peter J. Rubinstein the retiring senior rabbi of Central Synagogue and Rabbi DavidsonåÛåªs mentor as well as the past senior rabbis at Temple Emanu-El Rabbi David M. Posner who became senior rabbi in 2000 and Dr. Ronald B. Sobel who became senior rabbi in 1974. Rabbi DavidsonåÛåªs wife Mia Fram Davidson a cantor at Westchester Reform Temple will sing.         Welcoming the crowd will be John H. Streicker the president of the temple. åÛåÏFrankly we liked the fact that he was youngeråÛå Mr. Streicker said Tuesday of the decision to hire Rabbi Davidson. åÛåÏWeåÛåªre proud of our legacy and we donåÛåªt want to give it away yet weåÛåªve got to build on it to remain relevant.åÛå

Figures released by the national statistics bureau on Tuesday showed that industrial output an important gauge of economic activity grew 10 percent in November compared with a year earlier. That was a touch below analystsåÛåª forecasts but in line with the performance of the past few months.         Retail sales climbed 13.7 percent solidly beating analyst expectations and picking up from the previous few months the government said.         And investment in fixed assets such as equipment and machinery åÛåÓ an important factor in ChinaåÛåªs growth in recent years åÛåÓ climbed 19.9 percent in the first 11 months of 2013 compared with the same period a year ago. That was slightly less than expected.         Those numbers followed solid trade data reported on Sunday which showed November exports gaining 12.7 percent åÛåÓ nearly twice what analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast. And a survey of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector produced a reading of 51.4 for November unchanged from the previous month but solidly above the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction.         Taken together analysts said the data painted a picture of an economy that is ticking along with perhaps a little less gusto than in the past few months but much more robustly than at the start of this year. That was when slowing growth prompted Beijing to deliver a series of measures aimed at propping up activity. Those moves and somewhat firmer demand for Chinese-made goods from overseas have helped put the economy on track for an expansion of about 7.5 percent this year economists said.         The November data China analysts at the Spanish bank BBVA said in a research note on Tuesday åÛåÏpoint to a moderating though still strong growth momentum.åÛå         The performance also provides a generally solid backdrop to an important meeting of Communist Party leaders that began in Beijing on Tuesday.         At that meeting åÛåÓ the annual Central Economic Work Conference as it is formally known åÛåÓ ChinaåÛåªs top leaders are expected to map out the countryåÛåªs economic policy agenda for the coming year effectively putting more flesh on the bones of the broad-brush policy pronouncements made at a larger party gathering last month. That meeting laid out the longer-term goals for revamping the Chinese economy in a bid to put its once supercharged growth on a more sustainable and balanced footing.         The economic work conference this week is expected among other things to set a target for the pace of economic expansion next year.         Analysts reading the runes of statements and recommendations made by government research organizations in recent weeks said it remained unclear whether the official 2014 growth target would be kept at 7.5 percent or trimmed closer to 7 percent.         Although there were some signs last month that policy makers could lean toward trimming back the official target the momentum more recently seems to have shifted toward 7.5 percent according to Zhang Zhiwei chief China economist in the Hong Kong office of Nomura citing a forecast of 7.8 percent this week by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. That number in Mr. ZhangåÛåªs view implied an official target of 7.5 percent for the coming year.

The boomer hypocrite is practically a comic type by this point but in his domestic disregard Murray Thwaite is like most other men liberal or conservative old or young.         Unlike many other rubrics by which you can establish the balance of power between men and women there isnåÛåªt much evidence of a cohort shift in housework. Younger men are doing roughly the same amount of work around the house as their fathers did. It doesnåÛåªt look like theyåÛåªre going to start doing more either.         Women today make up 40 percent of AmericaåÛåªs sole or primary breadwinners for families with children under 18 a share that has quadrupled since 1960. And yet in America as well as in several other countries in the developed world menåÛåªs time investment in housework has not significantly altered in nearly 30 years.         A recent large cross-national study on the subject by an Ohio State sociologist found that åÛåÏwomenåÛåªs housework did not decline significantly and menåÛåªs housework did not increase significantly after the mid-1980s in the United States the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.åÛå In the United States menåÛåªs participation in housework topped out at 94 minutes at day in 1998 but by 2003 was down to 81 minutes not much different than the 76 minutes it was in 1985.         Think of all the other changes that men have undertaken in the period between 1980 and 2010. Taking care of kids used to be womenåÛåªs work too but now the man with his kids is an icon of manliness. Foodie snobbism has taken on a macho edge in some circles to the point where the properly brined Thanksgiving turkey can be a status symbol of masculine achievement.         So why wonåÛåªt men pick up a broom? Why wonåÛåªt they organize a closet? Why canåÛåªt housework be converted åÛåÓ as the former burdens of food preparation and child rearing seem to have been for some men åÛåÓ into a source of manly pride and joy? Why would housework be the particular place to stall?         At least one thing is becoming clear: The only possible solution to the housework discrepancy is for everyone to do a lot less of it.         Despite its apparent banality housework has always been an intellectually confounding problem. The idea that the chores are a series of repetitive tasks undertaken to preserve the health and hygiene of the living space is an easy assumption to make. Nothing could be further from the truth; housework is as complex as the connection between our emotional life and our material life as subtle as all intimacy.         Even Marx and Engels the grandest of all labor theorists struggled to agree on a definition. Housework for Marx was not alienated labor like most other forms of production in capitalist life; it belonged to the category of craft the humanizing and personalizing of space. Even in MarxåÛåªs utopia it appears that people would still have to do housework. Engels believed that housework would eventually be industrialized. Feminism has more or less inherited this double view unsure whether to celebrate housework as unappreciated åÛåÏwomenåÛåªs workåÛå or to condemn it as a kind of societal imprisonment.         Cleanliness feels organic while being highly constructed. In Katherine AshenburgåÛåªs åÛåÏThe Dirt on CleanåÛå a study of historical standards of cleanliness the relativism of hygiene over time is amazing. The ancient Romans would have found Renaissance Europeans disgusting beyond belief (as their Muslim contemporaries did) and certainly my grandmother would find my house filthy. The standards have changed. There exists no agreed-upon definition of åÛåÏwhat has to be doneåÛå in a household. Difficulties of definition necessarily haunt all sociological studies but in the case of housework those difficulties press in from all sides. What exactly is the housework? How should the amount of housework be established? Studies generally use either a questionnaire or a diary to work out who is doing what. A 2007 study in Britain compared couples who used both a questionnaire and a diary and found significant discrepancies between them. One study compared self-reporting by husbands and wives and concluded that the perception of effort was totally distinct from the actual effort.

The statement from the  American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology  eased restrictions announced in September which said that gynecologists could lose their board certification if they treated men. Exceptions were made to allow certain procedures but screening men who were at high risk for anal cancer was not permitted so the September decision left some gynecologists struggling to find colleagues in other specialties to treat their male patients and to track those who were enrolled in studies.         Like  cervical cancer  anal cancer is usually caused by the  human papillomavirus  or HPV which is sexually transmitted. This type of cancer is rare but its incidence is increasing especially among men and women infected with  H.I.V.   Experts in anal cancer asked the board to reconsider its position and some started letter-writing campaigns. Patient advocacy groups expressed worry that the prohibition would interfere with research and make it harder for male patients to find screening and treatment.         The board had said it wanted to protect the profession as a female specialty and limit the nongynecological work performed by its members. But Dr. Kenneth L. Noller the boardåÛåªs director of evaluation said board members had reconsidered and realized that gynecologists had a long tradition of treating sexually transmitted infections in both men and women and that HPV and problems related to the virus fell into that category.         In addition he said the board recognized the importance of an coming study on anal cancer funded by the federal government and did not want to interfere with it. Finally board members said that they did not want to åÛåÏdisturb the doctor-patient relationship.åÛå Dr. Elizabeth Stier a gynecologist at Boston Medical Center  who had been forced to drop male patients  who had been in her care for years said she was happy and relieved to hear that the board had changed its mind.         åÛåÏHaving canceled all the men out of my clinic I now have to un-cancel themåÛå Dr. Stier said. åÛåÏTheyåÛåªll be very happy.åÛå         Dr. Mark H. Einstein a gynecologic oncologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx who had also been compelled to stop treating male patients said: åÛåÏCool heads have prevailed. This is the best decision for our patients.åÛå         Though most of Dr. StieråÛåªs patients are women she also took care of about 110 men last year who were at high risk for anal cancer. Screening tests for anal cancer involve techniques adapted from those used to screen women for cervical cancer. Dr. Stier had undergone extensive training to detect cancers and precancerous lesions in the anus and she will be involved in the federally funded study of men and women aimed at finding out whether screening and treating precancerous growths can prevent the cancer. The statement issued in September would have barred her from screening or treating men in that study.

Retired Lieutenant General Kuldeep Singh Brar 78 was attacked by a gang and slashed in the neck as he was walking with his wife near the busy Oxford Street shopping area during a holiday in Britain in September last year.         He was treated in hospital and discharged the next day.         Brar had spearheaded Operation Blue Star a military raid against Sikh separatists in the Golden Temple at Amritsar in 1984 in which 1000 people are estimated to have died.         Later that year Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her own Sikh bodyguards triggering a further wave of retaliation in which nearly 3000 Sikhs were killed.         Mandeep Singh Sandhu 35 from Birmingham in the English Midlands was sentenced to 14 years in prison London's Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement.         Dilbag Singh 37 of no fixed address was also sentenced to 14 years while a woman Harjit Kaur 39 from Hayes west of London was sentenced to 11 years.         They had been found guilty at Southwark Crown Court in July of wounding Brar with intent to do him grievous bodily harm.         Another man Barjinder Singh Sangha 34 of Wolverhampton also in the Midlands had admitted the same charge when he appeared at Southwark in January this year. He was sentenced to 10-1/2 years on Tuesday.         Having become aware last year of the presence in Britain of Brar and his wife the group travelled to London and carried out reconnaissance of the area where they were staying the police statement said.         Harjit Kaur followed the Brars around London and gave the three men regular updates on their mobile phones about the couple's movements and locations.         The attack took place as the couple were walking back to their hotel after an evening out.         ""As they passed the group Sangha grabbed Mr Brar's wife 68-year-old Meena and held her by the throat against a wall while the others attacked Mr Brar"" police said.         ""Sangha then joined the others in attacking Mr Brar who was fighting back in self-defense. Sangha drew a knife and slashed at (his) neck. At this point the assailants fled on foot leaving Mr Brar lying on the ground seriously injured.""         ""This was a pre-planned and organized attempt to assassinate General Brar for his military involvement in the siege of the Golden temple in India in 1984"" said Commander Richard Walton head of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command.

Yanukovich for more than two weeks.         Hours after senior Western diplomats arrived here for meetings with Mr. Yanukovich in an effort to defuse both the countryåÛåªs slide into political chaos and a deepening financial crisis thousands of riot police officers and Internal Ministry troops fanned across Kiev putting the Ukrainian capital in a virtual lockdown in the cold predawn darkness.         Officers descending a slope past the Hotel Ukraina punched an opening through a barricade that protesters had heavily reinforced. Officers later winched a rope to the barrier and ripped it down entirely. Ice and slush on the streets added to the unfolding confusion as some officers slid into a confrontation with demonstrators who chanted åÛåÏPeaceful Protest! Peaceful Protest!åÛå         There were fights and shoving matches as officers pushed into the plaza from virtually all sides taking up positions and blocking the crowdåÛåªs movements with interlocking shields. At least one of the tents or another makeshift structure erected by demonstrators caught fire. Officers in helmets pushed through the crowds with shields but did not use the truncheons hanging at their sides.         As the security forces spread throughout the square a large crowd of protesters brandishing sticks clubs metal rods and anything else they could find massed in front of the Trade Unions building which leaders of the demonstration had turned into the headquarters of what they call the National Resistance.         The crackdown by the authorities came hours after a three-and-a-half-hour meeting between Mr. Yanukovich and Catherine Ashton the European UnionåÛåªs foreign policy chief.         The diplomatic consequences became apparent almost immediately. åÛåÏI was among youåÛå Ms. Ashton said in a statement on Wednesday morning. åÛåÏThe authorities did not need to act under the cover of night.åÛå         And in unusually strong language Secretary of State John Kerry expressed the United StatesåÛåª åÛåÏdisguståÛå with the authoritiesåÛåª decision to use force. åÛåÏThis response is neither acceptable nor does it befit a democracyåÛå  he said in a statement .         He added: åÛåÏAs church bells ring tonight amidst the smoke in the streets of Kiev the United States stands with the people of Ukraine. They deserve better.åÛå         Western leaders including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who spoke by telephone with Mr. Yanukovich on Monday had sternly warned the government against the use of force on peaceful protests. Earlier on Tuesday demonstrators had milled about on Independence Square as they have every day since Dec. 1 when it was occupied and barricaded after a huge demonstration that drew hundreds of thousands. That rally was animated by public anger over a brief but bloody crackdown by the police against demonstrators the day before.         People first took to the streets nearly three weeks ago in anger over Mr. YanukovichåÛåªs sudden decision to scuttle far-reaching political and free-trade agreements with the European Union that had been in the works for more than a year and that he had promised to sign.         The storming of the plaza was especially surprising because Tuesday had largely been a day of consultations and discussions among senior officials. The talks with Western diplomats had focused heavily on UkraineåÛåªs acute financial troubles; a deepening cash crunch could leave the country broke within months.         Along with Ms. Ashton Victoria Nuland an assistant secretary of state returned to Kiev after making  a brief visit here last week  and then traveling elsewhere in the region including to Russia where she urged senior officials to help resolve the crisis in Ukraine.         Mr. Yanukovich also met with the three former presidents of Ukraine to begin what the government described as a process of åÛåÏround tableåÛå discussions to resolve the crisis.         By 3 a.m. Wednesday witnesses said that the police had largely divided the crowd into sectors and had cleared a substantial portion of the plaza. They then stood in formation but did not appear to be making arrests.         At one point protesters in construction hats bicycle helmets and other protective gear rushed toward the officers with blows being landed by both sides. Burning barrels tipped over sending up plumes of smoke.         Roman Bakus 30 had been standing in front of a long line of police officers in the embattled plaza and was knocked down by their advance.

If Amazon can imagine delivering books by drones is it too much to think that Google might be planning to one day have one of the robots hop off an automated Google Car and race to your doorstep to deliver a package?         Google executives acknowledge that robotic vision is a åÛåÏmoonshot.åÛå But it appears to be more realistic than AmazonåÛåªs proposed drone delivery service which Jeff Bezos AmazonåÛåªs chief executive revealed in a television interview the evening before one of the biggest online shopping days of the year.         Over the last half-year Google has quietly acquired seven technology companies in an effort to create a new generation of robots. And the engineer heading the effort is Andy Rubin the man who built GoogleåÛåªs Android software into the worldåÛåªs dominant force in smartphones.         The company is tight-lipped about its specific plans but the scale of the investment which has not been previously disclosed indicates that this is no cute science project.         At least for now GoogleåÛåªs robotics effort is not something aimed at consumers. Instead the companyåÛåªs expected targets are in manufacturing åÛåÓ like electronics assembly which is now largely manual åÛåÓ and competing with companies like Amazon in retailing according to several people with specific knowledge of the project.         A realistic case according to several specialists would be automating portions of an existing supply chain that stretches from a factory floor to the companies that ship and deliver goods to a consumeråÛåªs doorstep.         åÛåÏThe opportunity is massiveåÛå said Andrew McAfee a principal research scientist at the M.I.T. Center for Digital Business. åÛåÏThere are still people who walk around in factories and pick things up in distribution centers and work in the back rooms of grocery stores.åÛå         Google has recently started experimenting with package delivery in urban areas with its Google Shopping service and it could try to automate portions of that system. The shopping service available in a few locations like San Francisco is already making home deliveries for companies like Target Walgreens and American Eagle Outfitters.         Perhaps someday there will be automated delivery to the doorstep which for now is dependent on humans.         åÛåÏLike any moonshot you have to think of time as a factoråÛå Mr. Rubin said. åÛåÏWe need enough runway and a 10-year vision.åÛå         Mr. Rubin the 50-year-old Google executive in charge of the new effort began his engineering career in robotics and has long had a well-known passion for building intelligent machines. Before joining Apple Computer where he initially worked as a manufacturing engineer in the 1990s he worked for the German manufacturing company Carl Zeiss as a robotics engineer.         åÛåÏI have a history of making my hobbies into a careeråÛå Mr. Rubin said in a telephone interview. åÛåÏThis is the worldåÛåªs greatest job. Being an engineer and a tinkerer you start thinking about what you would want to build for yourself.åÛå         He used the example of a windshield wiper that has enough åÛåÏintelligenceåÛå to operate when it rains without human intervention as a model for the kind of systems he is trying to create. That is consistent with a vision put forward by the Google co-founder Larry Page who has argued that technology should be deployed wherever possible to free humans from drudgery and repetitive tasks.         The veteran of a number of previous Silicon Valley start-up efforts and twice a chief executive Mr. Rubin said he had pondered the possibility of a commercial effort in robotics for more than a decade. He has only recently come to think that a range of technologies have matured to the point where new kinds of automated systems can be commercialized.         Earlier this year Mr. Rubin stepped down as head of the companyåÛåªs Android smartphone division. Since then he has convinced GoogleåÛåªs founders Sergey Brin and Mr. Page that the time is now right for such a venture and they have opened GoogleåÛåªs checkbook to back him. He declined to say how much the company would spend.

Comet ISONåÛåªs close approach åÛåÓ and its possible demise from the sunåÛåªs heat and gravitational forces åÛåÓ will give scientists an unprecedented look at the ingredients that came together to form the planets.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs a dinosaur bone of solar system formationåÛå said Carey M. Lisse a senior research scientist at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University during a NASA news conference on Tuesday.         If the comet survives åÛåÓ though many experts like Dr. Lisse think it will not åÛåÓ it could provide a bright and striking addition to the night sky in early December as it zooms near Earth on its way back out. The best times for viewing would be right before sunrise or right after sunset. Currently it is not readily visible because it is too close to the sun.         In recent years astronomers have spotted many sun-grazing comets but this one is different. Named for the International Scientific Optical Network in Russia which discovered it in September 2012 it appears to have originated in the Oort Cloud a sphere of debris about a light-year from the sun. Most of the earlier sun grazers appear to be pieces from a larger comet that looped around the sun many times.         ISON was probably dislodged a few million years ago by the gravitational nudge of a passing star sending it on a trajectory to the inner solar system for the first time and quite possibly the last.         åÛåÏAnd weåÛåªre going to watch it bake and boilåÛå Dr. Lisse said.         NASAåÛåªs fleet of spacecraft including the Hubble Space Telescope and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have been taking pictures as the comet entered the inner solar system. åÛåÏThis particular comet is of extreme interest to usåÛå said James L. Green the director of planetary science at NASA.         Few comets are discovered so far out and some scientists at first thought ISON was several miles in diameter and would become the åÛåÏComet of the CenturyåÛå rivaling the brightness of a full moon.         But as the comet passed Mars the NASA orbiter took pictures showing that it was three-quarters of a mile wide at most smaller than most comets.         Because ISON was discovered so far away astronomers had plenty of time to plan their observations. Measurements by NASAåÛåªs Spitzer Space Telescope which takes infrared photographs showed a large envelope of carbon dioxide around the nucleus. åÛåÏIt is looking like carbon dioxide may be a very fundamental molecule in that early solar system rather than carbon monoxideåÛå Dr. Lisse said.         As ISON approaches the sun the motions of its tail reveal the usually invisible movements in the solar wind the torrent of particles continually ejected by the sun.         In recent days the comet has behaved erratically brightening and dimming; that has led to speculation that it has already fallen apart. åÛåÏWe just donåÛåªt know if itåÛåªs in one piece or notåÛå said Karl Battams an astrophysicist at the Naval Research Laboratory.         Even falling apart could be valuable. Dr. Lisse said scientists understood how fine dust particles conglomerated into larger particles the size of BBs and marbles and they know how comet-size objects can combine into planets. But they have not figured out how the BB- and marble-size objects combine into comets.         åÛåÏWhen the BBs and the marbles hit each other they fall apartåÛå Dr. Lisse said. By looking at the process in reverse he went on scientists can åÛåÏsee how it got put togetheråÛå in the first place.

Among the thousands who attended SundayåÛåªs informal tribute at the site where Paul Walker a star of the multibillion-dollar åÛåÏFast and FuriousåÛå movie franchise died in a crash  on N ov. 30  Mr. Padron picked up an overlooked red fragment. Holding it in his left palm he said he believed it to be a carbon fiber remnant from the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT in which Mr. Walker and his friend Roger Rodas had been driving.         With Mr. Rodas at the wheel of the Porsche the two men who were also business partners had set out from their nearby Always Evolving racing shop in Rye Canyon Business Park. The crash occurred near the sharp corner onto Hercules Street the Porsche smashing into a pole and several small oak trees before bursting into flames.         On Sunday afternoon Mr. Enrique had joined other fans as part of what the Los Angeles County SheriffåÛåªs Department termed an åÛåÏunsanctionedåÛå event. The 20-year-old student from Camarillo Calif. said he had always enjoyed the åÛåÏfamily feelåÛå of the six street-racing movies.         åÛåÏEverybody comes togetheråÛå he said explaining that he regularly shows his 2004 Ford Mustang GT at cruise nights in Oxnard Calif. åÛåÏYou become a car fanatic.åÛå          Promoted on a Facebook page  the tribute drew an enormous crowd that impressed upon many observers the extent of Mr. WalkeråÛåªs stardom and the depth of the filmsåÛåª influence. More than 8000 people had indicated on the Paul Walker/Roger Rodas Memorial Meet page that they would attend. For most of them driving to this community some 30 miles north of Los Angeles was no more than a two-hour journey.         One Inland Empire group had posted its plan to leave San Bernardino at 9 a.m. sharp and cover the 90-mile journey well before 11:00 a.m. An Audi club from San Diego dispatched a convoy of 25 cars that included a souped-up Chevrolet Cobalt for the 150-mile trip.         About 100 Harley-Davidsons from the Vietnam Vets/Legacy Vets motorcycle club Chapter L had convened a few miles away in Sylmar after traveling independently from all directions in honor of their fellow member Paul Walker Sr. the staråÛåªs father the clubåÛåªs past president Manuel Escobedo said. The bikers departed the memorial at around 2:30 p.m. hoping to stay warmer on the 55-degree afternoon than they had on their morning ride.         For others it had been a much longer trip. A 15-car procession traveled the 425 miles from Gilbert Ariz. while other carsåÛåª license plates showed that people had traveled from as far away as Oregon Utah and New Mexico. Several groups came from Las Vegas and one lone-eagle Mercedes-Benz had carried its occupants on a two-day 1700-mile jaunt from Minot N.D.         åÛåÏA little road tripåÛå the driver said before moving along in the procession past the crash site.         There the commotion was just short of intense. A sheriffåÛåªs helicopter buzzed overhead and twin banner-towing airplanes circled in formation with a longish message: åÛåÏR.I.P. God be with Fast & Furious star Paul WalkeråÛå_ Our hearts go out to his friends and family.åÛå It was signed: åÛåÏParis Hilton.åÛå         Meanwhile the parade of cars proceeding up Kelly Johnson Parkway and onto Hercules Street ranged from bland åÛåÓ as with a completely stock Toyota Corolla åÛåÓ to flamboyant åÛåÒ namely a Cadillac Escalade EXT rolling on 32-inch rims. A host of right-hand-drive cars from Japan gave street-racing enthusiasts a dose of Japanese Domestic Market or J.D.M. authenticity. Every sort of ground-scraping Honda and Nissan imaginable showed up and dozens of sport bikes rolled by the riders often revving their engines in a deafening salute.         Many of those who walked the half-mile after parking at Walmart or Home Depot laid bouquets and candles on the curb although some left car parts and bottles of beer.         One person standing nearby Nancy NollÌÄå© said she had been at home in Knokke-Heist Belgium when she learned of the deaths on Facebook.         åÛåÏIs that real?åÛå she remembered thinking. She had already planned a trip to California to visit a friend so they decided to visit Santa Clarita together. Ms. NollÌÄå© said she didnåÛåªt find the display of emotion there surprising. åÛåÏIn Europe the grieving is smaller.åÛå         Paul Walker is credited with saying åÛåÏIf one day the speed kills me do not cry because I was smiling.åÛå This became an epitaph of sorts plastered everywhere duplicated on hoodies in die-cut vinyl lettering applied to car bodies and even on the back of a racing helmet where it had been handwritten before being placed near one of the charred oaks at the crash site.         Although the sheriffåÛåªs department investigation into the accident is not complete many people at the memorial procession had their own theories of how it happened. It was common to blame the of the caråÛåªs handling but Ryan Jones of nearby Saugus who said he åÛåÏused to be a big raceråÛå had visited the scene soon after the accident and said he saw power-steering fluid on the pavement.         Whatever the cause it would seem that after Sunday the Rye Canyon Business Park is likely to join the spot on what is now California Route 46 where James Dean crashed his Porsche in 1955 as a hallowed location.         åÛåÏRace in paradiseåÛå Jasmin Alvarez wrote on a memorial banner. Mr. Walker brought åÛåÏgreat memories to the racing scene despite the speed and dangeråÛå Ms. Alvarez 23 said. åÛåÏWe really do have love for each other.åÛå

Organizers who hope it will be the Super Bowl of mass transit announced plans on Monday that they said would use buses and rails to move more people to and from the game than for any Super Bowl before.         At a news conference inside the Frank R. Lautenberg Station at Secaucus Junction coordinators for Super Bowl XLVIII and transportation officials made it clear that driving to the nearby MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford should be the least desirable option on the day of the game Feb. 2 because parking will be very limited and tight security will make traveling around the stadium difficult. In addition they said if the weather is inclement driving conditions could be hazardous.         åÛåÏPeople should put the getting around in the hands of professionalsåÛå said Alfred F. Kelly Jr. the president and chief executive of the  NY/NJ Super Bowl Host Committee  adding that he expected as many as 80 percent of spectators to use public transportation.         And those who do secure a parking pass will not be allowed to engage in a tradition that many football fans consider sacred during the regular season: tailgating. Barbecue grills and lounge chairs will be forbidden and all food and drink must be consumed within the space of a single parking spot a rule that has been in place at the Super Bowl since 2002 officials said.         About 400000 visitors are expected to descend on the New York region in the week before the Super Bowl and about 80000 will attend the game itself officials said.         New York City subways New Jersey Transit and PATH trains will have about the same level of service as during weekday rush periods. For the game the host committee will operate a bus fleet called the Fan Express to carry people to and from five sites in Manhattan and four in New Jersey. The buses will cost $51 round trip and one lane of the Lincoln Tunnel will be dedicated to them.         åÛåÏThe bus piece is different and newåÛå Mr. Kelly said. åÛåÏItåÛåªs like the Olympics model.åÛå         Public transit is especially crucial to this yearåÛåªs Super Bowl because only about 13000 parking spaces will be available at MetLife Stadium. The rest of the more than 28000 spaces there will be taken up by trucks used to televise the game and to provide entertainment.         In addition to the buses New Jersey Transit trains will be operating with game-day service from Secaucus Station to the stadium. New Jersey Transit also will sell a $50 unlimited-ride ticket called a Super Pass valid Jan. 27 to Feb. 3.         åÛåÏIf thereåÛåªs any region that knows how to deal with public transportation issuesåÛå said Jonathan Tisch an owner of the New York Giants and one of the chairmen of the host committee åÛåÏitåÛåªs this region.åÛå         For regular season football games about 10000 to 12000 spectators travel to the stadium by train and a smaller number by bus officials said. Other arrive in 30000 vehicles that park at the stadium and off-site lots.         Parking passes for Jets and Giants games at MetLife Stadium are $25 to $35 but Brian McCarthy a spokesman for the National Football League said the limited number of spaces for the Super Bowl will each cost $150. They will go on sale Thursday.         Ticket holders who might plan to hire a private car service might have to rethink those plans: for the first time Super Bowl officials will not allow passenger drop-off zones at the stadium.         No vehicle without a parking pass will be allowed into the security perimeter around the stadium organizers said. Nor will pedestrians even those walking from home Mr. Kelly said.         James Simpson the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Transportation said road crews would have plows ready in case of a snowstorm.         åÛåÏWe have the trucks management and manpower on hand to fight any kind of weatheråÛå Mr. Simpson said. åÛåÏOur goal is to keep vehicles on the move.åÛå         Robert Wood Johnson IV another chairman of the host committee said transportation was one of the biggest issues on his mind when he helped make the Super Bowl bid to the N.F.L.         Mr. Johnson who owns the Jets said åÛåÏIåÛåªve been to enough Super Bowls to know weåÛåªre not going to have any problem.åÛå

But the day ended without reports of a breakthrough and with a warning by a leading American lawmaker that he was prepared to introduce legislation next month that would impose new economic sanctions on Iran.         The talks on Thursday between Catherine Ashton the European UnionåÛåªs top foreign policy official and Mohammad Javad Zarif IranåÛåªs foreign minister were described by a spokesman for Ms. Ashton as åÛåÏintenseåÛå and åÛåÏsubstantial.åÛå          Their negotiations  were to continue Friday morning.         Reports in the Iranian news media suggested that the talks might continue into the weekend and could end with the arrival of Secretary of State John Kerry and the foreign ministers of other world powers if a deal appeared close. But whether the remaining issues can be resolved was unclear.         At issue is an interim agreement that the United States and five other world powers are seeking to halt progress in IranåÛåªs program for six months so negotiators could pursue a more comprehensive agreement.         President Obama has told lawmakers that the United States was prepared to provide $6 billion to $7 billion in sanctions relief as part of the interim accord.         Adding to the drama was a starkly anti-Zionist speech on Wednesday by IranåÛåªs supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Politicians in Israel expressed outrage not only about Ayatollah KhameneiåÛåªs description of Israel as åÛåÏthe rabid dog of the regionåÛå but also about the mild condemnation that the speech elicited from the United States and much of Europe.         Hilik Bar the deputy speaker of IsraelåÛåªs Parliament and a member of the opposition Labor Party wrote to Mr. Kerry and Ms. Ashton insisting that they åÛåÏstand up against the dark racist statements and incitement.åÛå         Asked about Ayatollah KhameneiåÛåªs comments by Senator Marco Rubio Republican of Florida during Mr. KerryåÛåªs testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday the secretary of state expressed his unhappiness with the speech though he appeared to temper his response to avoid unsettling the talks.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs inflammatory and itåÛåªs unnecessaryåÛå Mr. Kerry said. åÛåÏI donåÛåªt want to exacerbate it now sitting here but our good friends in Israel know full well that we defend their concerns.åÛå         Leading members of Congress were less constrained. Senator Bob Corker Republican of Tennessee introduced legislation on Thursday that would give the White House 60 days to conclude an interim agreement. If such an accord were achieved and Mr. Obama were later informed that the Iranians were not in compliance with some of its provisions the president would have no more than 15 days to reverse the sanctions relief that he had granted Iran.         Mr. CorkeråÛåªs legislation would also give the White House no more than 180 additional days to conclude a more comprehensive agreement that the Obama administration says it is seeking or any sanctions that had been relaxed would be reimposed.         The aim of the legislation is to prevent the Iranians from dragging out the talks and making an initial agreement the final one.         It also would set more stringent terms for a comprehensive deal than Iran is currently prepared to accept by demanding that Tehran end uranium enrichment.         Senator Harry Reid the majority leader said on Thursday that he was prepared to move ahead next month with legislation that would toughen economic sanctions if Iran continued with its nuclear efforts.         åÛåÏWhile I support the administrationåÛåªs diplomatic effort I believe we need to leave our legislative options open to act on a new bipartisan sanctions bill in DecemberåÛå Mr. Reid said.

The Earth and the Moon appear as small dots to the lower right of Saturn below the bright main rings and above the faint bluish E ring. Another haunting feature appearing as a bright dot to the far left is Enceladus which can be seen emitting sprays of mist water that some astronomers think might contain the best evidence of life beyond Earth in this solar system.

Gareth Williams 31 a Welsh-born mathematician involved in code-breaking work was found dead on Aug. 23 2010 by police officers who entered his London apartment. His naked body was curled in a fetal position inside a sports bag in an otherwise empty bathtub. In a twist worthy of a spy movie the bag was padlocked but the keys to the lock were inside the bag beneath the decomposing body.         Mr. Williams had evidently led a private existence with few close friends. But with its tantalizing glimpse into the secretive world of espionage the åÛåÏspy in a bagåÛå case drew intense interest from the news media which speculated that Mr. Williams might have been killed or might have died as an accidental consequence of an interest in escapology or bondage.         A post-mortem examination failed to identify a cause of death. A coroneråÛåªs inquest in 2012 found that  someone else was probably involved  in the death. However the police now say they believe that Mr. Williams was most likely alone and locked himself in the bag though they cannot rule out the possibility that someone else was present.         åÛåÏFrom the inquest we set up our investigation in a different way and this has led to greater clarity on some aspects of the caseåÛå Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt who oversaw the police investigation said in a statement. åÛåÏNow at the end of our investigation based on the evidence or where we have been unable to find positive evidence we believe that it is a more probable conclusion that there was no other person present when Gareth died.åÛå         After three years of investigation Mr. Hewitt said åÛåÏmany questions remain unanswered.åÛå         He said there was no evidence that Mr. WilliamsåÛåªs apartment on Alderney Street in the Pimlico neighborhood åÛåÓ close to the headquarters of the  Secret Intelligence Service  where he had been working åÛåÓ had been åÛåÏdeep-cleanedåÛå a term used for the removal of forensic traces by intelligence operatives. There was also nothing to suggest a struggle or a break-in he said.         Though the police did not themselves demonstrate that it was possible for a person to lock himself inside a bag Mr. Hewitt said they saw video of this being done.         Why Mr. Williams would have done so was not entirely clear. The 2012 coroneråÛåªs inquest heard evidence that he had visited websites dedicated to bondage and claustrophilia which involves seeking sexual thrills from being shut in enclosed spaces.         Mr. WilliamsåÛåªs family said in a statement on Wednesday that they stood by the coroneråÛåªs findings åÛåÓ that he was probably the victim of an unlawful killing åÛåÓ rather than those of the police.         åÛåÏWe are naturally disappointed that it is still not possible to state with certainty how Gareth died and the fact that the circumstances of his death are still unknown adds to our griefåÛå the family said. åÛåÏWe consider that on the basis of the facts at present known the coroneråÛåªs verdict accurately reflects the circumstances of GarethåÛåªs death.åÛå

Bush in a second term plagued by sinking credibility failed legislative battles fractured world relations and revolts inside his own party.         President Obama is now threatened by a similar toxic mix. The disastrous rollout of his health care law not only threatens the rest of his agenda but also raises questions about his competence in the same way that the Bush administrationåÛåªs botched response to Hurricane Katrina undermined any semblance of Republican efficiency.         But unlike Mr. Bush who faced confrontational but occasionally cooperative Democrats Mr. Obama is battling a Republican opposition that has refused to open the door to any legislative fixes to the health care law and has blocked him at virtually every turn. A contrite-sounding Mr. Obama repeatedly blamed himself on Thursday for the failed health care rollout which he acknowledged had thrust difficult burdens on his political allies and hurt AmericansåÛåª trust in him.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs legitimate for them to expect me to have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole range of these issues in generalåÛå Mr. Obama said. The president did not admit to misleading people about whether they could keep their insurance but again expressed regret that his assurances turned out to be wrong.         åÛåÏTo those Americans I hear you loud and clearåÛå Mr. Obama said as he announced changes intended to allow some people to keep their insurance.         But earning back the confidence of Americans as he pledged to do will require Mr. Obama to right more than just the health care law. At home his immigration overhaul is headed for indefinite delay and new budget and debt fights loom. Overseas revelations of spying by the National Security Agency have infuriated American allies and negotiations over IranåÛåªs nuclear arsenal have set off bipartisan criticism.         For the first time in Mr. ObamaåÛåªs presidency surveys suggest that his reserve of good will among the public is running dry. Two polls in recent weeks have reported that a majority of Americans no longer trust the president or believe that he is being honest with them.         åÛåÏWhen you start losing the trust and confidence not only of Congress but the American people that makes it even more difficultåÛå said Senator Joe Manchin III Democrat of West Virginia. åÛåÏYou can work yourself out. But you have to be sincere and you have to be honest.åÛå         The difficulties have put Mr. Obama on the defensive at exactly the moment he might have seized political advantage in a dysfunctional Washington. If not for the health care disaster the two-week shutdown of the government last month would have been an opportunity for Mr. Obama to sharpen the contrast with Republicans. Democratic lawmakers expressed growing frustration on Thursday with the opportunities the party had missed to hammer home the ideological differences between the two parties. The lawmakers say there is intensifying anxiety within the Democratic caucus that the poor execution of the health care law could bleed into their 2014 re-election campaigns.         Republicans readily made the Hurricane Katrina comparison. åÛåÏThe echoes to the fall of 2005 are really eerieåÛå said Peter D. Feaver a top national security official in Mr. BushåÛåªs second term. åÛåÏKatrina which is shorthand for bungled administration policy matches to the rollout of the website.åÛå Looking back he said åÛåÏwe can see that some of the things that we hoped were temporary or just blips turned out to be more systemic from a political sense. ItåÛåªs a fair question of whether thatåÛåªs happening to President Obama.åÛå         The presidentåÛåªs top aides vehemently reject the comparison of Mr. ObamaåÛåªs fifth year in office to the latter half of Mr. BushåÛåªs second term. They say Americans lost confidence in Mr. Bush because of his administrationåÛåªs ineptitude on Hurricane Katrina and its execution of the war in Iraq while Mr. Obama is struggling to extend health care to millions of people who do not have it. Those are very different issues they said.         åÛåÏIåÛåªm always very leery of these apocalyptic predictionsåÛå said David Axelrod a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama.

The 84-page document known as an apostolic exhortation was the first major work he has authored alone as pope and makes official many views he has aired in sermons and remarks since he became the first non-European pontiff in 1300 years in March.         In it Francis went further than previous comments criticizing the global economic system attacking the ""idolatry of money"" and urged politicians to ""attack the structural causes of inequality"" and strive to provide work healthcare and education to all citizens.         He also called on rich people to share their wealth. ""Just as the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill' sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life today we also have to say 'thou shalt not' to an economy of exclusion and inequality. Such an economy kills"" Francis wrote in the document issued on Tuesday.         ""How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure but it is news when the stock market loses 2 points?""         The pope said renewal of the Church could not be put off and said the Vatican and its entrenched hierarchy ""also need to hear the call to pastoral conversion"".         ""I prefer a Church which is bruised hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets rather than a Church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security"" he wrote.         Italian theologian Massimo Faggioli greeted the work as ""the manifesto of Francis"" while veteran Vatican analyst John Thavis called it a ""Magna Carta for church reform"".         ""The message on poverty sets Pope Francis on a collision course with neo-liberal Catholic thought especially in the United States"" said Faggioli an expert on the Second Vatican Council and reform in the Catholic Church.         Other Catholic analysts added that progressive streams in the Church would bristle at the document's rejection of women priests though it leaves open the door to women taking other ""decision-making"" positions in the Church.         SIMPLE STYLE         In July Francis finished an encyclical begun by Pope Benedict but he made clear that it was largely the work of his predecessor who resigned in February.         Called ""Evangelii Gaudium"" (The Joy of the Gospel) the exhortation is presented in Francis' simple preaching style distinct from the more academic writings of former popes and stresses the Church's central mission of spreading the gospel.         A meditation on how to revitalize a Church suffering encroaching secularization in the West the exhortation echoed the zeal often heard from evangelical Protestants who have won over disaffected Catholics in the pope's native Latin America.         In it economic inequality features as one of the issues Francis is most concerned about and the 76-year-old pontiff calls for an overhaul of the financial system and warns that unequal distribution of wealth inevitably leads to violence.         Denying it was simple populism he called for action ""beyond a simple welfare mentality"" and added: ""I beg the Lord to grant us more politicians who are genuinely disturbed by the state of society the people the lives of the poor.""         Since his election Francis has set an example for austerity in the Church living in a Vatican guest house rather than the ornate Apostolic Palace travelling in a Ford Focus and last month suspending a bishop who spent millions of euros on his luxurious residence.         He chose to be called ""Francis"" after the medieval Italian saint of the same name famed for choosing a life of poverty.         Munich Cardinal Reinhard Marx one of eight special papal advisers said the pope aimed his criticism at modern society ""but also at the Church itself which is always tempted to look inward and betray its mission of evangelization"".         Stressing cooperation among religions Francis quoted the late Pope John Paul II's idea that the papacy might be reshaped to promote closer ties with other Christian churches and noted lessons Rome could learn from the Orthodox such as ""synodality"" or decentralized leadership.         He praised cooperation with Jews and Muslims and urged Islamic countries to guarantee their Christian minorities the same religious freedom as Muslims enjoy in the West.

New York City and Chicago are considering adding e-cigarettes to their bans on smoking in bars restaurants and parks and Los Angeles is moving to restrict e-cigarette sales even though e-cigarettes donåÛåªt generate smoke and while not proved to be entirely safe for users are undoubtedly less hazardous than tobacco cigarettes.         The evidence while still thin suggests that many e-cigarette users hoping to kick the habit use e-cigarettes as a safer alternative to tobacco. Research also suggests that e-cigarettes may be better at helping to sustain smoking cessation than pharmaceutical products like nicotine patches or gums.         No one believes nicotine addiction is a good thing and our qualified support for e-cigarettes is not one we reach lightly. Although some e-cigarette manufacturers have no links to the tobacco industry Big Tobacco is consuming an ever-greater share of the e-cigarette market.ÌâåÊIt is hard for public health advocates like us to look favorably on anything the industry wants. But history shows that harm reduction åÛåÓ the doctrine that many risks cannot be eradicated and that efforts are best spent on minimizing the resulting harm åÛåÓ has had an important place in antismoking efforts and suggests that regulation is better than prohibition.         ItåÛåªs been only a half-century since the federal government took an interest in making tobacco products safer. In 1964 Surgeon General Luther L. Terry issued a watershed report definitively linking smoking with lung cancer. But he also described research into new kinds of cigarettes as åÛåÏa promising avenue for further development.åÛå In the early 1970s the government spent some $6 million a year to try to develop safer tobacco products. Even the health secretary Joseph A. Califano Jr. who called smoking åÛåÏPublic Enemy No. 1åÛå saw in 1978 a place for åÛåÏresearch aimed at creating a less hazardous cigarette.åÛå As late as 1981 the surgeon general advised smokers who couldnåÛåªt or wouldnåÛåªt quit to switch to low-tar and low-nicotine brands.         The American Cancer Society while worried that the development of less hazardous cigarettes might derail efforts to deter people from smoking or getting them to quit supported åÛåÏfrank scientific discussion about the possibilities of developing cigarettes that will be less harmful and still satisfying to smokers.åÛå         This effort came to a halt in the 1980s when stunning revelations from high-profile court cases demonstrated that the tobacco industry had lied about the dangers of smoking for decades and even manipulated the levels of nicotine in its products to ensure that smokers stayed hooked. The magnitude of the deception made it nearly impossible to consider the possibility of a åÛåÏsaferåÛå tobacco product. It inspired among advocates opposition to anything less than total cessation.         This new stance was supported by the availability of over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapies and a focus on protection of bystanders from secondhand smoke. As the head of the American Heart Association put it in 2000: åÛåÏThere is no such thing as a safer cigarette.åÛå         The irony is that during these same years AIDS prompted public health advocates to support needle exchange for users of intravenous drugs a harm-reduction approach that also drew fire from those who favored complete elimination of drug use. Fears that such programs would lead to greater illicit drug use have been definitively put to rest.         Of course the analogy is not exact: Unlike clean needles which present no independent harms to injecting drug users less risky alternatives to smoking like smokeless chewing tobacco and the moist tobacco product known as snus carry a grave risk: oral cancers.         E-cigarettes potentially overcome that barrier. Most experts consider nicotine harmful only at extremely high doses. Tobacco control advocates tolerate the long-term use of therapies like the nicotine patch and nicotine gum despite their approval only as temporary smoking-cessation aids. In 2000 the chairman of a Public Health Service panel called tobacco dependence a åÛåÏchronic condition that warrants repeated treatmentåÛå even if that meant treating smokers åÛåÏfor the rest of their lives.åÛå         Advocates fear that e-cigarettes will serve as a gateway to deadly cigarettes åÛåÓ or sustain smokers in public settings where lighting up is banned. åÛåÏWaiting to actåÛå New York CityåÛåªs health commissioner Thomas A. Farley said åÛåÏis a risk we should not take.åÛå         But there is a price to such rigidity. Emotion should not rule out harm reduction even if eradication of smoking is the ultimate goal. Banning vaping in public wonåÛåªt help. Instead e-cigarettes should be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration as products åÛåÏsold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease.åÛå The industry canåÛåªt be trusted to provide safer products. The historical mistake was not the pursuit of a safer cigarette but championing that cause with dishonest partners.         If e-cigarettes can reduce even slightly the blight of six million tobacco-related deaths aÌâåÊyear trying to force them out of sight is counterproductive.

Last month six world powers and Tehran reached an interim deal that provided limited relief to Iran from economic sanctions opening the way for some oil payments to resume.         The deal is a chance for Iran's new leadership to revive the country's economy plagued with high inflation and a weakened currency since being cut off from the global financial system after sanctions were imposed in 2012.         The West believes Iran is trying to make a bomb while the Middle Eastern nation says it programme is for power generation.         India and Iran are to discuss how to restart oil payments in foreign currencies including a plan to process partial payments for oil in euros through a Turkish bank two government sources said.         A delegation of Iranian officials led by Gholamali Kamyab deputy governor at Iranian Central Bank is in India until December 13 and is meeting with officials of the finance ministry and Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday the sources said.         Iran had asked Indian refiners in mid-October before the deal was reached with world powers to resume paying for oil imports in euros through Turkey's Halkbank but the refiners are still seeking directions from the government.         India started settling 55 percent of its payments for Iranian crude in euros through Halkbank in mid-2012. The rest was settled in rupees through India's UCO Bank.         But the Halkbank route was halted in February this year when fresh sanctions prevented Iran from repatriating cash earned from oil it has been able to sell crippling its economy by choking off its biggest revenue stream.         Since then Indian refiners have been withholding payment for 55 percent of their Iranian oil imports while Iran scouted for an alternative way to receive that money in hard currencies like dollar and euros.         At the end of November Indian refiners owed about $2.2 billion for partial payments to Iran on top of about $4 billion lying in Tehran's account with UCO Bank industry officials said on Tuesday.         India is Iran's second-largest buyer but its oil imports from the OPEC member plunged to about 170000 bpd in the April-October period a decline of about 40 percent from a year ago tanker arrival data made available to Reuters showed.         A finance ministry official said this week India would continue to settle part of its oil payments in rupee through UCO Bank until receiving further information on the lifting of U.S. and EU sanctions on Iran.         India wants to fix its trade imbalance with Iran tilted now in favour of Tehran because of oil purchases. New Delhi wants to boost its exports to the Islamic nation by letting Iran pay for goods in the billions of rupees it has in UCO Bank.         Indian exports to Iran are expected to touch $6 billion in the year to March 31 2014 almost double from last fiscal year's $3.2 billion said Ajay Sahai director general Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO).         He said the rupee trade mechanism had helped exports of agricultural commodities pharmaceutical and auto components to Tehran. An industry delegation will visit Iran next week to push up exports industry sources said.         (Reporting by Manoj Kumar and Nidhi Verma; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Tom Hogue)

Instead it is a consequence of simply expanding the definition of who should take the drugs åÛåÓ a decision that will benefit the pharmaceutical industry more than anyone else.         The new guidelines among other things now recommend statins for people with a lower risk of heart disease (a 7.5 percent risk over the next 10 years compared with the previous guidelinesåÛåª 10 to 20 percent risk) and for people with a risk of stroke. In addition they eliminate the earlier criteria that a patientåÛåªs åÛåÏbad cholesterolåÛå or LDL be at or above a certain level. Although statins are no longer recommended for the small group of patients who were on the drugs only to lower their bad cholesterol eliminating the LDL criteria will mean a vast increase in prescriptions over all. According to our calculations it will increase the number of healthy people for whom statins are recommended by nearly 70 percent.         This may sound like good news for patients and it would be åÛåÓ if statins actually offered meaningful protection from our No. 1 killer heart disease; if they helped people live longer or better; and if they had minimal adverse side effects. However none of these are the case.          Statins  are effective for people with known heart disease. But for people who have less than a 20 percent risk of getting heart disease in the next 10 years statins not only fail to reduce the risk of death but also fail even to reduce the risk of serious illness åÛåÓ as shown in a  recent BMJ article  co-written by one of us. That article shows that based on the same data the new guidelines rely on 140 people in this risk group would need to be treated with statins in order to prevent a single heart attack or stroke without any overall reduction in death or serious illness.         At the same time 18 percent or more of this group would experience side effects including  muscle pain  or weakness decreased cognitive function increased risk of  diabetes  (especially for women)  cataracts  or sexual dysfunction.         Perhaps more dangerous statins provide false reassurances that may discourage patients from taking the steps that actually reduce cardiovascular disease. According to the World Health Organization 80 percent of cardiovascular disease is caused by smoking lack of exercise an unhealthy diet and other lifestyle factors. Statins give the illusion of protection to many people who would be much better served for example by simply walking an extra 10 minutes per day.         Aside from these concerns we have more reasons to be wary about the data behind this expansion of drug therapy.         When the last guidelines were issued by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in 2001 they nearly tripled the number of Americans for whom cholesterol-lowering drug therapy was recommended åÛåÓ from 13 million to 36 million. These guidelines were reportedly based strictly on results from clinical trials. But this was contradicted by the data described in the document itself.         For example even though the guidelines recommended that women between the ages of 45 and 75 at increased risk of heart disease and with relatively high LDL levels take statins the fine print in the 284-page document admitted åÛåÏClinical trials of LDL lowering generally are lacking for this risk category.åÛå The general lack of evidence for LDL level targets is why they have been dropped from the current guidelines. In fact committee members noted that cholesterol lowered by drugs may not have the same effect as cholesterol lowered by nondrug methods such as diet exercise and being lucky enough to have good genes.         The process by which these latest guidelines were developed gives rise to further skepticism. The group that wrote the recommendations was not sufficiently free of conflicts of interest; several of the experts on the panel have recent or current financial ties to drug makers. In addition both the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology while nonprofit entities are heavily supported by drug companies.         The American people deserve to have important medical guidelines developed by doctors and scientists on whom they can confidently rely to make judgments free from influence conscious or unconscious by the industries that stand to gain or lose.         We believe that the new guidelines are not adequately supported by objective data and that statins should not be recommended for this vastly expanded class of healthy Americans. Instead of converting millions of people into statin customers we should be focusing on the real factors that undeniably reduce the risk of heart disease: healthy diets exercise and avoiding smoking. Patients should be skeptical about the guidelines and have a meaningful dialogue with their doctors about statins including what the evidence does and does not show before deciding what is best for them.

The stores play religious music. Employees get free spiritual counseling. But they do not get free insurance coverage for some contraceptives even though President ObamaåÛåªs  health care law  requires it.         Hobby Lobby a corporation says that forcing it to provide the coverage would violate its religious beliefs. A federal appeals court  agreed  and the  Supreme Court  is set to decide on Tuesday whether it will hear the Obama administrationåÛåªs appeal from that decision or appeals from one of several related cases.         Legal experts say the court is all but certain to step in setting the stage for another major decision on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act two years after  a closely divided court sustained  its requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance or pay a penalty.         åÛåÏThe stakes here symbolically and politically are very highåÛå said  Douglas Laycock  a law professor at the University of Virginia citing the clash between religious teachings and the administrationåÛåªs embattled health care law.         In weighing those interests the Supreme Court would have to assess the limits of a principle recognized in its 2010 decision in  Citizens United  which said corporations have free speech rights under the First Amendment. The question now is whether corporations also have the right to religious liberty.         In ruling for Hobby Lobby the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit said it had applied åÛåÏthe First Amendment logic of Citizens United.åÛå         åÛåÏWe see no reason the Supreme Court would recognize constitutional protection for a corporationåÛåªs political expression but not its religious expressionåÛå  Judge Timothy M. Tymkovich  wrote for the majority.         A dissenting member of the court  Chief Judge Mary Beck Briscoe  wrote that the majorityåÛåªs approach was åÛåÏnothing short of a radical revision of First Amendment law.åÛå         But Judge  Harris L Hartz  in a concurrence said the case was in some ways easier than Citizens United. åÛåÏA corporation exercising religious beliefs is not corrupting anyoneåÛå he wrote.         Among Hobby LobbyåÛåªs lawyers is  Paul D. Clement  who led the 2012 Supreme Court challenge to the health care law. The new case opened another front in a larger war on the law which as Hobby Lobby put it in  its Supreme Court brief  åÛåÏimposes massive obligations on individuals and corporations alike in the process of attempting to fundamentally reorder the nationåÛåªs health care system.åÛå         Mr. ClementåÛåªs main adversary in the 2012 case Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr.  told the justices  that the 10th CircuitåÛåªs åÛåÏunprecedented rulingåÛå in this case would allow åÛåÏfor-profit corporations to deny employees the health coverage to which they are otherwise entitled by federal law based on the religious objections of the individuals who own a controlling stake in the corporations.åÛå         The Supreme Court is generally receptive to appeals from the solicitor general especially when a lower court has effectively held a federal law unconstitutional. The justices are also apt to step in when as here lower courts are divided on an important legal question. Even Hobby Lobby which won in the appeals court agrees that the justices should hear the administrationåÛåªs appeal.         åÛåÏThis is a perfect stormåÛå said  Richard Garnett  a law professor at Notre Dame adding that it is also a worrisome one. åÛåÏDebates about campaign finance in Citizens United and abortion and ObamacareåÛå he said åÛåÏcould distort the courtåÛåªs analysis of religious freedom.åÛå          Hobby Lobby  was founded in 1970 in Oklahoma City by David Green and it now has more than 500 stores and 13000 employees of all sorts of faiths. Mr. Green and his family own Hobby Lobby through a privately held corporation.         The Greens told the justices in their brief that some drugs and devices that can prevent embryos from implanting in the womb are tantamount to abortion and that providing insurance coverage for those forms of contraception would make the company and its owners complicit in the practice. They said they had no objection to 16 other forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration including condoms diaphragms sponges several kinds of birth control pills and sterilization surgery.         But Hobby LobbyåÛåªs failure to offer comprehensive coverage could it said subject it to federal fines of $1.3 million a day. Dropping insurance coverage for its employees it added would be disruptive and unfair and lead to fines of $26 million a year.         Mr. Verrilli countered that requiring insurance plans to include comprehensive coverage for contraception was justified by the governmentåÛåªs interest in åÛåÏthe promotion of public healthåÛå and in ensuring that åÛåÏwomen have equal access to health care services.åÛå Doctors rather than employers should decide which form of contraception is best he added.         The administration has excluded many religious organizations from the lawåÛåªs requirements; it has grandfathered some insurance plans that had not previously offered the coverage; and under the health care law small employers need not offer health coverage at all. In June a federal judge in Tampa Fla.  estimated  that a third of Americans are not subject to the requirement that their employers provide coverage for contraceptives.         But the administration drew a line at larger for-profit secular corporations.         åÛåÏCongress has granted religious organizations alone the latitude to discriminate on the basis of religion in setting the terms and conditions of employment including compensationåÛå the Justice Department  told the 10th Circuit appeals court  in Denver.         åÛåÏNo court has ever found a for-profit company to be a religious organization for purposes of federal lawåÛå the brief went on. åÛåÏTo the contrary courts have emphasized that an entityåÛåªs for-profit status is an objective criterion that allows courts to distinguish a secular company from a potentially religious organization without conducting an intrusive inquiry into the entityåÛåªs religious beliefs.åÛå         The appeals court disagreed ruling that Hobby Lobby is a åÛåÏpersonåÛå for purposes of the relevant federal law the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 .         Religious liberty Judge Tymkovich wrote cannot turn on whether money changes hands. åÛåÏWould an incorporated kosher butcher really have no claim to challenge a regulation mandating non-kosher butchering practices?åÛå he asked.         Other federal appeals courts considering challenges to the health care lawåÛåªs so-called contraception mandate have ruled that the 1993 law does not apply to corporations.         After finding that Hobby Lobby was entitled to the lawåÛåªs protections the 10th Circuit went on to say that the companyåÛåªs sincere religious beliefs had been compromised without good reason noting the limited number of contraception methods at issue and the many employers exempt from the lawåÛåªs requirements.         Professor Laycock said that only one thing was certain about the issues presented in the case Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores No. 13-354.         åÛåÏTheyåÛåªre almost sure to take itåÛå he said of the justices åÛåÏand no one has any idea how itåÛåªs going to come out.åÛå

This person said that the commissioner William P. White had requested but never received permission from the office of Mayor Vincent C. Gray to publish a critique of Mr. ObamaåÛåªs surprise announcement on Thursday that he would allow thousands of Americans to renew policies that might not provide the minimum coverage required by the health law.         Instead of waiting to hear from Mr. GrayåÛåªs office the person said Mr. WhiteåÛåªs office posted the statement on the city governmentåÛåªs website less than 15 minutes after sending an email seeking approval. Later when confronted by the mayor Mr. White said he had received permission from the mayoråÛåªs staff even though he had not the person said.         In an interview Mr. White said that Victor L. Hoskins WashingtonåÛåªs deputy mayor told him that the mayor had åÛåÏdecided to go in a different directionåÛå and that Mr. WhiteåÛåªs services would no longer be needed. Mr. White who had been commissioner for roughly three years said his statement on the Affordable Care Act was not mentioned during his conversation with Mr. Hoskins.         Mr. White said that although he commonly sent releases to the mayoråÛåªs office it was not his normal practice to wait for the mayor or the mayoråÛåªs office to sign off. He added that he did not misrepresent to the mayor that he had permission to send out the release.         åÛåÏWhen I issue statements I am speaking on behalf of the department about insurance and I donåÛåªt speak on behalf of the mayoråÛå Mr. White said. åÛåÏIn this instance however the issue was clearly more political than usual.åÛå         Michael M. Flagg a spokesman for Mr. White referred questions to the mayoråÛåªs office saying he could not discuss personnel matters.         Mr. WhiteåÛåªs statement took direct issue with Mr. ObamaåÛåªs decision saying the presidentåÛåªs policy reversal to allow the continuation of canceled policies åÛåÏundercuts the purpose of the exchanges including the DistrictåÛåªs DC Health Link by creating exceptions that make it more difficult for them to operate.åÛå         Mr. Obama had been criticized heavily over the canceled policies because he had said many times that people who liked their insurance would be able to keep it under the new law. Mr. ObamaåÛåªs reversal which allows states to continue policies that had been canceled but does not require that they do so threw the issue into the laps of insurance companies and insurance commissioners like Mr. White who typically regulate insurance policies.         In a meeting with Mr. Obama at the White House on Friday executives for the major insurance companies expressed mixed feelings about whether the continuation of canceled policies could work in every state.         At the same time several insurance commissioners voiced their opinions on the move.         åÛåÏI do not believe his proposal is a good deal for the State of WashingtonåÛå Mike Kreidler the insurance commissioner there said Thursday.         The commissioner in Florida by contrast supported the proposal.         The person with knowledge of the situation said that Mayor Gray was unhappy with the tone of Mr. WhiteåÛåªs statement if not the substance of its arguments.

Susie Walker-Byrd has switched her sonåÛåªs high school three times to accommodate his basketball dreams. Carmelita Clay is convinced that her son should be on national television because of his basketball skills.         If being a basketball mom were a competitive sport this group of mothers from Kentucky would be perennial all-stars.         Overaggressive parents hollering from the stands have become a clichÌÄå© of American childhood but these moms have turned parental cheering into an art form åÛåÓ and they hope a business. Six Kentucky families have signed a deal with NorthSouth Productions a television company to make a reality show about their hoops-mad families.         It is unclear if the project will appear on the screen any time soon but the producer Blaine Hopkins called the mothers perfectly suited to reality TV describing them as åÛåÏhysterical passionate real and competitive.åÛå         The mothers say they want to draw attention to their sons in hopes of drawing a college scholarship. But their zeal has raised the eyebrows of the boysåÛåª coaches as well as the boys themselves.         åÛåÏSometimes IåÛåªve wanted to know what being a regular kid was likeåÛå said Jordan Green an 18-year-old 6-foot-6 senior forward who is the son of Michelle Green. åÛåÏFrom Day 1 all IåÛåªve known is basketball.åÛå         His mother makes no apologies for her behavior. When Green who works at a middle school cheers from the stands she said åÛåÏI turn into a complete different person.åÛå         åÛåÏI am an animalåÛå she continued. åÛåÏI heckle everybody åÛåÓ the parents the players the referees.åÛå         The six mothers hoping to star in the show know each other from the sidelines of their sonsåÛåª various basketball games. They are not close friends but they all have centered their familyåÛåªs lives on their sonsåÛåª jump shots in hopes of gaining the attention of college coaches.         åÛåÏHeåÛåªs got to get a scholarshipåÛå Green said of Jordan who scored a team-high 16 points in a victory last week. åÛåÏWhen in sixth grade they start talking about scholarships it became business for me.åÛå         Before his freshman year Jordan told his mother he wanted to play with his friends at Henry Clay High in Lexington a school with a rich basketball tradition. But they lived in the Bryan Station High School district about five miles from Henry Clay. Green decided to put her house of 10 years on the market and move her family for JordanåÛåªs game. A buyer fell throughÌâåÊso she said she filed for bankruptcy åÛåÓ and then moved closer to Henry Clay.         A single mother Green 47 has held two jobs at times to help pay for JordanåÛåªs basketball expenses. She said she spent about $10000 on basketball last summer alone.         When Jordan plays it is easy to find Green who is 6 feet tall and who played on a basketball scholarship at Paine College a Division II university. She takes a Fathead-like image of her sonåÛåªs face to games. Never mind the cheerleaders she leads students in shouting singsong chants: åÛåÏIåÛåªm blind! IåÛåªm deaf! I want to be a ref!åÛå         GreenåÛåªs enthusiasm is not always welcomed. Two years ago at an Amateur Athletic Union tournament in Las Vegas she was escorted out by security after arguing with a mother from the opposing team. Green said the woman threatened to kill her.         åÛåÏIåÛåªm the most flamboyant and rambunctious parent everåÛå Green said.         JordanåÛåªs high school coach Daniel Brown has said that he would not participate in a television show if one were to come to fruition. åÛåÏIt does individualize the kid when youåÛåªre talking about a team sportåÛå Brown said.         Everything changed for Susie Walker-Byrd 48 when her son Bryce Walker-Byrd entered the fifth grade. That is when basketball became more than just a diversion and BryceåÛåªs summers like his winters became dedicated to playing in as many games as possible.

So administrators moved to ban the clothing.         They explained in a letter to parents that åÛåÏwhile the students wearing the labeled clothing are all chatting excitedlyåÛå the students without it åÛåÏtend to walk by trying not to take notice.åÛå What an ordeal.         Many parents favored the ban a prophylactic against disappointment.         Some did not noting that life would soon enough deal the kids much worse blows along these lines. And one observer in a Facebook thread said this according to a local TV stationåÛåªs  report : åÛåÏPerhaps they should dress the children in Bubble Wrap and tie mattresses to their backs so they donåÛåªt get hurt.åÛå         I assume thatåÛåªs facetious.         But these days you never know.         I occasionally flash on that anecdote as I behold the pushback against more rigorous education standards in general and the new  Common Core  curriculum in particular. And it came to mind when Education Secretary Arne Duncan recently got himself into a big mess.         Duncan defending the Common Core at an education conference identified some of its most impassioned opponents as  åÛåÏwhite suburban momsåÛå  who were suddenly learning that åÛåÏtheir child isnåÛåªt as brilliant as they thought they were and their school isnåÛåªt quite as good.åÛå         It was an impolitic bit of profiling. Gratuitous too. But if you follow the fevered lamentations over the Common Core look hard at some of the complaints from parents and teachers and factor in the modern cult of self-esteem you can guess what set Duncan off: a concern wholly justified that tougher instruction not be rejected simply because it makes children feel inadequate and that the impulse to coddle kids not eclipse the imperative to challenge them.         The Common Core a laudable set of guidelines that emphasize analytical thinking over rote memorization has been adopted in more than 40 states. In instances its implementation has been flawed and its accompanying emphasis on testing certainly warrants debate.         WhatåÛåªs not warranted is the  welling hysteria : from right-wing alarmists who hallucinate a federal takeover of education and the indoctrination of a next generation of government-loving liberals; from left-wing paranoiacs who imagine some conspiracy to ultimately privatize education and create a new frontier of profits for money-mad plutocrats.         Then thereåÛåªs the outcry equally reflective of the times from adults who assert that kids arenåÛåªt enjoying school as much; feel a level of stress that they shouldnåÛåªt have to; are being judged too narrowly; and doubt their own mettle.         ArenåÛåªt aspects of school supposed to be relatively mirthless? IsnåÛåªt stress an acceptable byproduct of reaching higher and digging deeper? ArenåÛåªt certain fixed judgments inevitable? And isnåÛåªt mettle established through hard work?         Apparently not to judge from some reactions to the Common Core in New York which has been holding hearings on the guidelines.          One father said  that while his 8-year-old son was åÛåÏnot the most book-smart kidåÛå he was nonetheless åÛåÏextremely bright.åÛå With the new instruction however too many kids were åÛåÏbeing made to feel dumb.åÛå There was åÛåÏno room for imagination or playåÛå the father groused. åÛåÏAll the kids are stressed out.åÛå         A SOCIAL WORKER  testified  that sheåÛåªd been receiving calls and referrals regarding elementary-school students on the psychological skids. åÛåÏThey said they felt åÛå÷stupidåÛåª and school was åÛå÷too hardåÛåªÌâåÊåÛå she related. åÛåÏThey were throwing tantrums begging to stay home and upset even to the point of vomiting.åÛå Additional cases included insomnia suicidal thoughts and self-mutilation she said and she wondered aloud if this could all be attributed to the Common Core.         A teacher on Long Island did more than wonder  speaking out at a forum  two weeks ago about what she called the Common Core Syndrome a darkly blooming anxiety among students thatåÛåªs åÛåÏdirectly related to work that they do in the classroom.åÛå         åÛåÏIf thatåÛåªs not child abuse I donåÛåªt know what isåÛå she thundered to wild applause. Then she endorsed the idea of parentsåÛåª exempting kids from Common Core-related tests. åÛåÏThe mommies in New YorkåÛå she concluded åÛåÏdonåÛåªt abuse their children.åÛå         If children are unraveling to this extent itåÛåªs a grave problem. But before we beat a hasty retreat from potentially crucial education reforms we need to ask ourselves how much panic is trickling down to kids  from  their parents and whether weåÛåªre paying the price of having insulated kids from blows to their egos and from the realization that not everyoneåÛåªs a winner in every activity on every day.         There are sports teams and leagues in which no kid is allowed too much more playing time than another and in which excessive victory margins are outlawed. Losing is looked upon as pure trauma to be doled out gingerly. After one Texas high school football team beat another last month by a lopsided score of 91-0 the parent of a losing player  filed a formal complaint  of bullying against the winning teamåÛåªs coach.         It used to be that trophies went to victors; now in many leagues they go to everybody åÛåÓ for participation. Some teams no longer have one or two captains elected by the other players but a rotating cast so that nobodyåÛåªs left out.         Some high schools have 10 20 or 30 valedictorians along with bloated honor rolls and a surfeit of graduation prizes. Many kids at all grade levels are Bubble-Wrapped in a culture that praises effort nearly as much as it does accomplishment.         And praise itself is promiscuous though there are experts with profound reservations about that approach. They say it can lessen motivation and set children up to be demoralized when they invariably fail at something.         åÛåÏOur students have an inflated sense of their academic prowessåÛå  wrote Marc Tucker  the president of the National Center on Education and the Economy in Education Week. åÛåÏThey donåÛåªt expect to spend much time studying but they confidently expect good grades and marketable degrees.åÛå         David Coleman one of the principal architects of the Common Core told me that heåÛåªs all for self-esteem but that rigorous standards åÛåÏredefine self-esteem as something achieved through hard work.åÛå         åÛåÏStudents will not enjoy every step of itåÛå he added. But if it takes them somewhere big and real theyåÛåªll discover a satisfaction that redeems the sweat.         And theyåÛåªll be ready to compete globally an ability that too much worry over their egos could hinder. As Tucker observed åÛåÏWhile American parents are pulling their kids out of tests because the results make the kids feel bad parents in other countries are looking at the results and asking themselves how they can help their children do better.åÛå

But the leaders of the House and Senate budget committees åÛåÓ Representative Paul D. Ryan Republican of Wisconsin and Senator Patty Murray Democrat of Washington åÛåÓ encountered last-minute resistance from House Democratic leaders who said any deal should be accompanied by an extension of expiring unemployment benefits for 1.3 million workers.         åÛåÏThis isnåÛåªt interparty bickeringåÛå said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California the House minority leader. åÛåÏThis is a major policy disagreement.åÛå         It was not clear on Thursday how serious a threat the demand posed to a deal largely worked out by Mr. Ryan and Ms. Murray alone. With conservative Republicans in the House likely to balk Democratic votes will be needed to pass an agreement and Democrats have not said whether they will make their support contingent on an extension of benefits.         Democrats were confident that if they held their ground Republicans would agree next week to extend unemployment compensation åÛåÓ and Speaker John A. Boehner left open that possibility.         åÛåÏIf the president has a plan for extending unemployment IåÛåªll take a look at itåÛå he said.         The deal would increase revenue by raising some fees and would shift some cuts away from domestic and defense programs partly alleviating the squeeze of across-the-board spending cuts imposed last year which are set to worsen in 2014. Spending on defense and domestic programs would rise to about $1 trillion for the current fiscal year from $986 billion the fiscal 2013 level that remains in effect under the continuing resolution passed in October. Absent a deal further cuts would go into effect in January and discretionary spending would be cut to $967 billion for fiscal 2014.         But the agreement would leave to future negotiations the big issues of curbing future spending increases in the fast-growing entitlement programs and the proper level of tax revenues. It also would not extend unemployment benefits set to expire Dec. 28 or deal with impending cuts to Medicare health care providers.         Still a deal would have a major psychic benefit to an economic recovery that seems to be gaining some momentum. With new åÛåÏtop-lineåÛå spending numbers in place for the next two fiscal years the recurring threat of government shutdowns would recede for a time providing more certainty to the private sector and room for budget negotiators to reach a broader deal.         But both parties clearly have an incentive to reach a final agreement before the House adjourns for the year next Friday. Democrats are eager to alleviate a growing spending squeeze and head off the next round of across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration set to take effect next month. Republican leaders anxious to keep the political focus on President ObamaåÛåªs health care law want to avert another budget showdown åÛåÓ and possible government shutdown åÛåÓ on Jan. 15 when parts of the government will again run out of money.         åÛåÏI am hopeful Paul Ryan and Patty Murray are going to come to an agreement that can pass the House and the SenateåÛå Mr. Boehner said.         The budgets passed out of the House and Senate this spring were vastly different in policy prescriptions over the long term but only $90 billion apart in the spending at CongressåÛåªs annual discretion. Once negotiators gave up trying to reconcile House Republican efforts to drastically change Medicare and Senate DemocratsåÛåª push to raise taxes to finance new spending on infrastructure and education the search for a more modest deal became far easier.         åÛåÏThis is a three-and-a-half-trillion-dollar budgetåÛå said Representative Tom Cole Republican of Oklahoma and one of the budget negotiators. åÛåÏThe idea that you canåÛåªt find either cuts or sources of funding in something that large to split the difference on $90 billion åÛåÓ thereåÛåªs a way. ThereåÛåªs enough low-hanging fruit to give us a reasonable top line for åÛåª14 and åÛåª15.åÛå         But the deal taking shape will be tough for members of both parties to swallow.        
1.0,4.58,5.560827067999999,6.62,1431.609,0.34436401200000005,1258.486,43.0,1235.0639999999999,958.0,1382.9579999999999,23.0,AUBURN Ala. åÛåÓ A football dynasty died Saturday or at least went comatose.         Barreling down on a shot at its fourth national title in five years top-ranked Alabama was ambushed by Auburn 34-28 in the teamsåÛåª closeout to the regular season on an almost unimaginable play: a last-second length-of-the-field runback on the Crimson TideåÛåªs fourth missed field-goal attempt of the game.         The Tide on the verge of winning the West division title of the Southeastern Conference yielded two touchdowns in the closing 32 seconds.         Now No. 4 Auburn the lone program other than Alabama to corral a Bowl Championship Series title in the last four seasons might have a chance to keep the crystal trophy in-state. With a victory in the SEC championship game next Saturday in Atlanta and perhaps with help from a fortunate outcome in the Atlantic Coast Conference or Big Ten finales the Tigers could surface in the B.C.S. title game.         åÛåÏI told our team that this is like March Madness coming into the game and youåÛåªve got to keep winning in the tournament to keep playingåÛå Alabama Coach Nick Saban said.         The game certainly provided strong doses of November nuttiness. In retrospect Cade FosteråÛåªs unsuccessful field-goal attempt of 44 yards which scuttled the TideåÛåªs opening series was a harbinger.         Early in the fourth quarter Foster was sent out to break a 21-21 tie from 33 yards. The ball veered left just as it did on his first attempt.         All of that was a mere prelude to the play at the end of regulation when AuburnåÛåªs Chris Davis caught a desperation field-goal attempt by Adam Griffith AlabamaåÛåªs backup kicker about a yard inside the back line of his teamåÛåªs end zone.         Davis who noticed that Crimson Tide players on his left had relaxed wound up sailing down the sideline practically untouched for a touchdown return of more than 100 yards that brought euphoria to Jordan-Hare Stadium.         åÛåÏFirst time IåÛåªve lost a game that wayåÛå said Saban who added that Alabama practiced for such situations. åÛåÏFirst time IåÛåªve ever seen a game lost that way.åÛå         Davis originally was not stationed deep on the play. His coach Gus Malzahn was granted a timeout and sent him back åÛåÓ just in case.         åÛåÏI knew when I caught the ball I would have room to runåÛå Davis said åÛåÏand I knew we had bigger guys on the field to protect.åÛå         The Tide (11-1 7-1) had taken a 28-21 lead earlier in the fourth quarter on a 99-yard touchdown pass from A J McCarron to Amari Cooper.         Alabama was poised to push its lead to 10 points but Saban ordered a run on fourth-and-short from the Auburn 27.         åÛåÏWe had missed from the same spotåÛå he said. åÛåÏYou canåÛåªt take it for granted we would have made it.åÛå         T. J. Yeldon was halted for no gain and Auburn (11-1 7-1) had a chance.         Minutes later when a 44-yard field-goal attempt from Foster was blocked the Tigers stormed back for the tying touchdown. The often-brilliant quarterback Nick Marshall stopped just short of the line of scrimmage on a rollout and lobbed a pass to Sammie Coates for a 39-yard score that tied the game 28-28.         Marshall expertly operating AuburnåÛåªs avant-garde rush-oriented rarely huddling offense confounded Alabama as he rushed for 99 yards and coaxed 197 more out of his backs while mixing in the occasional pass.         åÛåÏYouåÛåªve got to have tremendous discipline to play against this offenseåÛå said Saban who judged his defense as lacking.         Overtime loomed even as Yeldon barely beat the clock on a 24-yard dash out of bounds to the Auburn 38. Figuring there was nothing to lose Saban dispatched the field-goal brigade this time with Griffith handling the attempt from 57 yards. Saban noted that Griffith had been effective from 60 yards in practice and that the wind was blowing in a favorable direction.         What could go wrong?         DavisåÛåªs touchdown ended a contest that McCarron said was åÛåÏalmost like a video game.åÛå         McCarron had started a low-key Heisman Trophy campaign this season based largely around the TideåÛåªs phenomenal run of success while he was the teamåÛåªs quarterback. Alabama was a heavy favorite to win a third straight national title a goal that McCarron said was åÛåÏthe main reason I came back.åÛå         As for Saban his teams were 73-3 when they had entered the second half with a lead and Alabama was ahead 21-14 at the break. This lead was forged on three consecutive touchdowns two on McCarron passes sandwiched between two scores by Auburn.         But even when trailing by two scores Malzahn AuburnåÛåªs first-year coach stayed with his ground-oriented approach.         åÛåÏThey are a great run defenseåÛå said Malzahn who was the offensive coordinator for AuburnåÛåªs championship run three seasons ago. åÛåÏBut we felt like to win it we had to run the ball. ThatåÛåªs what got us here.åÛå         That the Tigers had a division title at stake was shocking enough. They had scrounged out only three wins last season and a team accustomed to losing might have been knocked out by the 99-yard score that put Alabama ahead in the fourth quarter.         åÛåÏYou look your guys in the eye and say åÛå÷LetåÛåªs go down and scoreåÛåªÌâåÊåÛå said Malzahn whose team won its previous game against Georgia on a desperation tipped pass for an implausible touchdown. åÛåÏThere was no panic on the sideline. Just weather the storm.åÛå         After the game Auburn supporters swarmed the field to celebrate DavisåÛåªs coast-to-coast run and they lingered for as long as half an hour. Next stop for all parties: Atlanta and a matchup against Missouri in the conference title game.         åÛåÏMan we worked hard for thisåÛå said running back Tre Mason who pounded out 164 rushing yards. åÛåÏAnd we canåÛåªt wait to get there.åÛå

""I have no doubt that the (bilateral security agreement with Afghanistan) ultimately will be concluded"" Ambassador James Dobbins U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.         While Dobbins said that an ongoing delay to finalizing the deal - which U.S. officials had hoped Karzai would sign weeks ago - would impose ""damages and costs"" on Afghans he said the Obama administration was not on the verge of abandoning its effort to extend its troop presence.         ""We're nowhere near a decision that would involve our departing Afghanistan altogether"" he said.         The administration has been urging Karzai to sign the bilateral security agreement (BSA) it negotiated with Karzai's government which would permit it to keep troops in Afghanistan beyond the end of 2014 to support Afghan forces and conduct limited counterterrorism activities.         After Afghan elders and politicians endorsed the pact last month Karzai surprised Washington by introducing new conditions for his signature.         If no deal can be finalized Washington says it will withdraw its entire force of 47000 troops in a little over a year. Other NATO nations are likely to follow suit.         The absence of foreign troops would likely dampen donor nations' willingness to fund Afghan troops and provide civilian aid.         ""My judgment is no troops no aid or almost no aid"" Dobbins said. If security conditions were to worsen sharply he said United States could conceivably even close its embassy in Kabul.         There are fears that the Taliban and other militants ultimately could regain strength the central government could founder and Afghanistan be plunged anew into civil war.         The possibility of a full withdrawal of foreign forces is already having a dangerous impact on Afghanistan Dobbins said as people pull money out of the country property prices fall and the Afghan currency slips in value.         Larry Sampler a senior official at the U.S. Agency for International Development told senators that it would be more difficult to find ways to carry out promised civilian assistance for impoverished Afghanistan without a security deal and a foreign troop presence.         'COLONIAL' PRESSURE         As U.S. frustrations with Karzai become increasingly public U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel made a surprise visit to Kabul last weekend. But in an unusual move he did not meet with Karzai.         In an interview with French newspaper Le Monde Karzai accused the United States of applying 'colonial' pressure on him to sign the pact and said Dobbins suggested during a recent visit to Kabul that without a security agreement there would be no peace.         The Obama administration has not yet said precisely how many troops it would leave in Afghanistan after 2014 if a deal is finalized that would fight a Taliban that remains a potent if diminished force         Senator John McCain a Republican pressed Dobbins for clarity on how many soldiers would be left in Afghanistan post-2014 and said announcing future troops levels might persuade Karzai to sign.         ""By not doing so you're making a very very serious mistake"" McCain said.         He said the Obama administration risked repeating the course of events in Iraq where U.S. officials halted efforts to seal a security deal with Iraq in late 2011 prompting the full withdrawal of U.S. troops at the end of that year.         Violence in Iraq is now at its highest level in at least five years and more than 8000 people have been killed this year the United Nations says.         (Editing by Philip Barbara)        "

Your immune system misinterprets a harmless protein like dust or peanuts as a threat and when you encounter it you pay the price with  sneezing   wheezing  and in the worst cases death.         What prompts some immune systems to err like this while others never do? Some of the vulnerability is surely genetic. But comparative studies highlight the importance of environment beginning it seems in the womb. Microbes are one intriguing protective factor. Certain ones seem to stimulate a motheråÛåªs immune system during  pregnancy  preventing allergic disease in children.         By emulating this naturally occurring phenomenon scientists may one day devise a way to prevent allergies.         This task though still in its infancy has some urgency. Depending on the study and population the prevalence of allergic disease and  asthma  increased between two- and threefold in the late 20th century a mysterious trend often called the åÛåÏallergy epidemic.åÛå         These days one in five American children have a respiratory allergy like  hay fever  and nearly one in 10 have asthma.         Nine people die daily from asthma attacks. While the increase in respiratory allergies shows some signs of leveling off the prevalence of food and skin allergies continues to rise. Five percent of children are allergic to peanuts milk and other foods half again as many as 15 years ago. And each new generation seems to have more severe potentially life-threatening  allergic reactions  than the last.         Some time ago I visited a place where seemingly protective microbes occurred spontaneously. It wasnåÛåªt a spotless laboratory in some university somewhere. It was a manure-spattered cowshed in IndianaåÛåªs Amish country.         My guide was Mark Holbreich an allergist in Indianapolis. HeåÛåªd recently discovered that the Amish people who lived in the northern part of the state were remarkably free of allergies and asthma.         About half of Americans have evidence of allergic sensitization which increases the risk of allergic disease. But judging from skin-prick tests just 7.2 percent of the 138 Amish children who Dr. Holbreich tested were sensitized to tree pollens and other allergens. That yawning difference positions the Indiana Amish among the least allergic populations ever described in the developed world.         This invulnerability isnåÛåªt likely to be genetic. The Amish originally came to the United States from the German-speaking part of Switzerland and these days Swiss children a genetically similar population are about as allergic as Americans.         Ninety-two percent of the Amish children Dr. Holbreich tested either lived on farms or visited one frequently. Farming Dr. Holbreich thinks is the Amish secret. This idea has some history. Since the late 1990s European scientists have investigated what they call the åÛåÏfarm effect.åÛå         The working hypothesis is that innocuous cowshed microbes plant material and raw milk protect farming children by favorably stimulating their immune systems throughout life particularly early on. That spring morning Dr. Holbreich gave me a tour of the bonanza of immune stimuli under consideration.         We found our hosts Andrew Mast and his wife Laura hard at work milking cows in the predawn chill.         Dr. Holbreich slight and bespectacled peppered them with questions. At what age did Mr. Mast begin working in the cowshed? åÛåÏMy first memory is of milkingåÛå he said at about the age of 5. What about his children two straw-haired girls then ages 2 and 3; did they spend time in the cowshed? The elder girl came to the barn at 3 months of age he said. åÛåÏPeople learn to walk in here.åÛå Do expectant mothers work in the barn? åÛåÏYesåÛå Laura said. åÛåÏWe work.åÛå         Dr. Holbreich had made his point: whatever forces were acting here they were chronic and they began before birth. As the sun rose Dr. Holbreich and I sniffed the damp fermented feed (slightly malty); shoveled fresh cow manure (åÛåÏLiquid goldåÛå Dr. Holbreich said only half-jokingly åÛåÏthe best medicine you could think ofåÛå); and marveled at the detritus floating in the air. Extrapolating from previous research with each breath we were inhaling perhaps 1000 times more microbes than usual. By breakfast time grime had collected under our nails hay clung to our clothes and muck to our boots. åÛåÏThereåÛåªs got to be bacteria mold and plant materialåÛå Dr. Holbreich said. åÛåÏYou do this every day for 30 years 365 days a year you can see there are so many exposures.åÛå         The challenge of identifying the important exposures åÛåÓ and getting them into a bottle åÛåÓ is a pressing one. In parts of the developing world where allergic disease was once considered rare scientists have noted an uptick especially in urban areas. China offers a dramatic case in point.  A 2009 study  found a more than threefold difference in allergic sensitization (as judged by skin-prick tests) between schoolchildren in rural areas around Beijing and children in the city proper. Doctor-diagnosed asthma differed sixfold. Maybe not coincidentally 40 percent of the rural children had lived on farms their whole lives.         Immigrants from the developing world to the developed tend to be  less allergic than average . But the longer they reside in their adopted countries the more allergic they become. And their native-born children seem to gain the vulnerability to asthma sometimes surpassing it. All of which highlights a longstanding question in the allergy field. As Dr. Holbreich puts it åÛåÏWhat is it about westernization that makes people allergic?åÛå

On Tuesday the National Intelligence Service of South Korea reported that the uncle Jang Song-thaek had been stripped of his powers apparently by the young leader he was supposed to supervise. It was the biggest in a series of purges promotions and reshufflings of elites that seem to have remade the government in the image of Mr. Kim who inherited his title and apparently techniques for keeping the government in control from his father and grandfather.         The political changes which were not announced by North Korea and could not be independently confirmed follow a series of upheavals especially within the military. American intelligence officials and some outside analysts speculate that Mr. Kim is sidelining the stalwarts of his father Kim Jong-il and elevating a new set of generals and party officials who owe their loyalty only to him. But there are also hints one American intelligence official said that åÛåÏthere was some kind of broader contest for control which Jang lost at least for now.åÛå         Early in the young Mr. KimåÛåªs tenure American intelligence assessments questioned whether he would have the staying power to remain in office and said he was regarded by the North Korean military as spoiled and naÌÄåøve.         Two years later those assessments are reversing. He is now seen as fully in charge. Mr. Kim has already begun testing the loyalty of top officials by dismissing or demoting them and letting them try to win his favor again åÛåÓ often by spying against others another technique of leadership inherited from his father according to South Korean officials and analysts.         Mr. JangåÛåªs apparent fall from power came after his two deputies at the administrative department of the ruling WorkersåÛåª Party of Korea were executed last month on charges of åÛåÏcorruption and anti-party activitiesåÛå according to South Korean lawmakers who were briefed by intelligence officials in a hurriedly scheduled meeting at the National Assembly in Seoul.         The intelligence agency did not reveal how it learned of the executions the lawmakers said.         åÛåÏI donåÛåªt think JangåÛåªs deputies were executed for mere corruption. Rather they were executed because they established a åÛå÷poweråÛåªÌâåÊåÛå said Cheong Seong-chang a senior analyst at Sejong Institute in South Korea.         Despite initial hints that Mr. Kim might seek a more cooperative relationship with the countryåÛåªs neighbors and the United States he has accompanied political changes at home with a hard-line nationalistic policy of accelerating the countryåÛåªs nuclear program the main card it has to play in international negotiations.         In February North Korea  conducted its third nuclear test  and it  appears to be restarting its capacity to produce plutonium  a main ingredient for its small nuclear arsenal. And it has threatened to attack Japanese South Korean and American targets though in recent months the countryåÛåªs warnings of imminent war have quieted.         The reported downfall of Mr. Jang effectively North KoreaåÛåªs No. 2 leader set off a frenzy of speculation among North Korea watchers and South Korean government officials. Since Mr. Kim took power they have theorized that a power and policy struggle might be playing out behind the public displays of mass solidarity. Mr. JangåÛåªs rise in power in the past few years coincided with the humiliation of the old military elite who surrendered some of their lucrative rights to trade in minerals and seafood to the cabinet and the party where Mr. Jang has built his career.         Some analysts said they feared that the eclipse of Mr. Jang so early in Mr. KimåÛåªs rule could suggest a power struggle that could destabilize the North. If so they worry that Mr. Kim might resort to militaristic provocations to divert attention from domestic instability.         On Tuesday the Defense Ministry in Seoul said it saw no unusual movement from the North Korean Army.

The engineer William Rockefeller met with investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board and detectives from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and New York City police for more than three hours on Tuesday åÛåÓ at one point tearing up according to his lawyer Jeffrey P. Chartier.         Mr. Chartier said Mr. Rockefeller was cooperating fully and was åÛåÏextremely remorseful.åÛå         Mr. Rockefeller told them that when he regained full awareness he shut down the throttle tried an emergency braking maneuver and braced for impact Mr. Chartier said. He added that after the crash Mr. Rockefeller opened the bulkhead door and helped passengers. The safety board did not immediately confirm this.         The train barreled into a curve at 82 miles per hour nearly three times the speed allowed through the area just north of the Spuyten Duyvil station in the Bronx.         Commuting has been disrupted on the railroadåÛåªs Hudson line since all seven of the trainåÛåªs cars and the locomotive derailed around 7:20 a.m. on Sunday though the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is expected to resume near-normal service on Wednesday morning.         A union representative Anthony Bottalico the acting director of the Association of Commuter Rail Employees told reporters that in a conversation Mr. Rockefeller had described nodding off just before the derailment.         åÛåÏPeople use the word åÛå÷zoned outåÛåª åÛå÷nodåÛåª åÛå÷fell asleepåÛåªÌâåÊåÛåÏ he said. åÛåÏIåÛåªm not a sleep expert.åÛå         In a rare move the safety board said late Tuesday that it had removed the union as a party to the investigation because Mr. Bottalico had åÛåÏdiscussed and interpreted information related to the ongoing investigationåÛå with the media. ÌâåÊOne of the few times the board has kicked investigators off its team also involved a New York accident in 1995 after a subway crash on the Williamsburg Bridge.         The board which is leading the investigation cautioned that many circumstances remained unclear and that human error had not been determined as the definitive cause.         To date though the agency has not revealed any significant track or equipment deficiencies.         Earl Weener a member of the safety board said there were åÛåÏno anomalies or degradation of the braking performance as the trip went along.åÛå         Mr. Weener said Mr. Rockefeller åÛåÓ whose route began before 6 a.m. in Poughkeepsie a new schedule he had had since Nov. 17 åÛåÓ was in the second day of a five-day workweek.         He reported to work at 5:04 a.m. on Sunday Mr. Weener said.         Mr. Chartier said Mr. Rockefeller reported going to bed about 8:30 p.m. Saturday and arose about seven hours later.         Mr. Weener said alcohol tests for the trainåÛåªs crew came back negative. Drug test results were not yet available.         The crash has also attracted the attention of the Federal Railroad Administration which said in a letter to the transportation authority that it had åÛåÏserious concernsåÛå about the authorityåÛåªs recent safety record.         A spokeswoman for the authority Marjorie Anders said some trains on Metro-North included åÛåÏalerteråÛå systems that can sound an alarm if inactivity is detected. If an engineer does not respond by pushing a button within 15 seconds she said the brakes are applied. She said the train that derailed had no such system.         The front car where Mr. Rockefeller was positioned had a åÛåÏdead manåÛåªs pedalåÛå on the floor. Pressure must be applied to avoid automatic braking.         Officials have said that the brakes were not fully applied until five seconds before the locomotive in the rear of the train came to a stop.         Detectives from the New York City and Metropolitan Transportation Authority police with assistance from the Bronx district attorneyåÛåªs office are collecting evidence to examine if officials determine that a crime occurred.         A law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of continuing investigations said a preliminary examination of Mr. RockefelleråÛåªs phone did not seem to indicate he had been texting or on a call.         Mr. Chartier said Mr. RockefelleråÛåªs phone had been off.         Even if investigators conclude that Mr. Rockefeller erred in operating the train any potential prosecution could be complicated. One possible precedent came last year when  Ophadell Williams  åÛåÓ a bus driver accused of being so tired that he crashed a bus in the Bronx killing 15 people åÛåÓ was found not guilty of manslaughter and other charges.         Patrick L. Bruno the lawyer for Mr. Williams in his criminal case said that if Mr. Rockefeller was found to have been distracted or impaired in any way the cases appeared at least somewhat analogous.         åÛåÏI would maintain youåÛåªre talking about a civil issue a lawsuit issueåÛå he said åÛåÏnot about prosecuting a man.åÛå         Rail safety experts have suggested that a system known as positive train control might have prevented the derailment. One of its features is to slow trains as they go around bends.         A federal law requires the authority to install positive train control by 2015         With all the rail cars removed track repairs were quickly made. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Tuesday that the Hudson line was expected to resume 98 percent of its regular service by the Wednesday morning rush.

Eventually he decided he wanted to live the same way he did on vacation when he was at home.         åÛåÏI love the wateråÛå he said. åÛåÏI need a pool.åÛå         But after a year of looking for a penthouse apartment in Rio de Janeiro where he interviewed celebrities for his show åÛåÏBehind the FameåÛå and is a partner in a public relations and artist management company called H2M ComunicaÌÄå¤ÌÄå£o he gave up. No apartment was going to offer the kind of seclusion he wanted.         åÛåÏI have to buy the landåÛå he told himself. åÛåÏAnd after I find the land I have to find an architect.åÛå         As it happened those two events took place almost simultaneously. In 2009 after Mr. Lerner had identified several prospects high in the hills of the SÌÄå£o Conrado neighborhood he found Arthur Casas a modernist architect with offices in SÌÄå£o Paulo and New York. Together they decided on a plot of land with a spectacular view of the ocean and Pedra da GÌÄåÁvea a 2769-foot granite dome that is a popular spot for paragliding.         Mr. Lerner who is now 40 had several priorities he informed his architect.         åÛåÏI wanted a big poolåÛå he said because åÛåÏI swim four times a week.åÛå         But cleanliness was equally important. åÛåÏI wanted something that doesnåÛåªt need maintenance; I like things very very cleanåÛå he said in what turns out to be something of an understatement.         Mr. Lerner you see owns four vacuum cleaners all of which he is comfortable operating himself. And he is not above using them outside he admitted if a few stray leaves should mar his pristine landscape. When a reporter visited last month he apologized because high winds had blown several leaves into the pool and the gardener hadnåÛåªt yet fished them out.         Happily client and architect were well matched Mr. Casas confirmed. åÛåÏI am also extremely picky about cleanliness and tidinessåÛå he wrote in an email.         So when Mr. Lerner insisted that the stone used for his house needed to be the same peach-beige-gray he had seen years before at the Western Wall in Jerusalem Mr. Casas understood. As did Renata Adoni Mr. LerneråÛåªs interior designer. åÛåÏI sent someone to Minas GeraisåÛå she said referring to the neighboring Brazilian state åÛåÏto find this exact stone.åÛå         And when Mr. Lerner was unhappy with the way the stonemasons laid the first wall åÛåÓ the stones looked crooked and randomly placed he thought not neatly lined up the way he had envisioned åÛåÓ Mr. Casas understood. The wall was redone.         Mr. Lerner was so intent on getting every detail right that he left his television job in 2011 so he could keep an eye on the construction. And it seems to have paid off.         The 5200-square-foot house which cost about $213 a square foot to build is immaculate. It feels light and airy despite all that stone thanks in part to the floor-to-ceiling sliding glass panels in front and back. The floors and much of the millwork are cumaru a hardwood that Mr. Casas said åÛåÏis extremely tough and great for outdoor use.åÛå (And needless to say it is kept very well vacuumed.)         On the ground floor are apartments for the gardener and the maid as well as two guest rooms; the master suite is on the third floor. Visitors enter on the second level which opens onto the pool with a view of the ocean beyond. (Mr. Casas cleverly raised the foundation of the house so the neighboråÛåªs roof below is obscured.) The poolside chaises like most of the furniture in the home are white with covers that can be removed and washed or scrubbed clean to Mr. LerneråÛåªs delight.         åÛåÏI spend my whole time hereåÛå he said seated on the terrace.         Now that he is ensconced in the house he plans to return to work full time. But he is still in awe of what he and his designers have accomplished åÛåÓ a feeling akin to the one he has every time he rents a place on St. Barts he said. It is hard to believe the house is his to keep.         As he said when he moved in earlier this year åÛåÏSomeday will I have to give it back?åÛå

The vote was 261 to 157 with 39 Democrats bucking their party leadership and the White House to vote in favor of the bill. Hours after the vote Mr. Obama and top aides met for over an hour with insurance executivesÌâåÊ after industry leaders complained Thursday that they had been blindsided by a  White House reversal on canceled policies . The president described the meeting as a åÛåÏbrainstormingåÛå session about how to ensure changes to the health care law go smoothly.         The insurance representatives from more than a dozen companies said they would work with the administration to protect the financial viability of the new marketplaces but did not say how. Afterward Karen Ignagni the president of AmericaåÛåªs Health Insurance Plans a trade group said it was a  åÛåÏvery productiveåÛå meeting  but would not go into detail.         The legislation approved by the House would go further than the fix announced on Thursday by Mr. Obama who said he would temporarily waive some requirements of the law and allow insurers to renew åÛåÏcurrent policies for current enrolleesåÛå for a year.         Many of the Democrats who supported the bill are facing tough re-election fights back home and expressed deep frustration with how the administration had handled the early carrying out of Mr. ObamaåÛåªs signature health care law. Representative Nick J. Rahall II Democrat of West Virginia who voted for the legislation said that the White House deserved an åÛåÏF-minusåÛå for its botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act.         åÛåÏIåÛåªm disgusted about itåÛå Mr. Rahall said. åÛåÏI think heads should roll downtown. Whoever was responsible or may have known that this was going to occur should no longer be employed.åÛå         Representative Ron Barber Democrat of Arizona who also joined Republicans in voting for the bill was equally scathing calling the rollout åÛåÏa disaster.åÛå         åÛåÏMy constituents are pretty upsetåÛå he said åÛåÏand so am I.åÛå         Representative Fred Upton Republican of Michigan and the chief sponsor of the House bill said it would fulfill a promise that Mr. Obama had made to the American people and then broken.         åÛåÏIn the last three yearsåÛå Mr. Upton said åÛåÏthe president personally promised that if people liked their current health care plan they could keep it åÛå÷no matter what.åÛåª But cancellation notices are now arriving in millions of mailboxes across the country. ItåÛåªs cancellation today sticker shock tomorrow.åÛå         Mr. Upton the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee belittled Mr. ObamaåÛåªs proposal saying it was offered at the last minute åÛåÏas the administrationåÛåªs allies in Congress panicked.åÛå         Senior Democrats criticized the Upton legislation as a ploy that could unravel the entire health care law.         åÛåÏDonåÛåªt pretend you care about the American peopleåÛåªs health care hereåÛå said Representative Mike Doyle Democrat of Pennsylvania. åÛåÏYou just want to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Democrats are not going to let you do that.åÛå         And Robert Zirkelbach a spokesman for AmericaåÛåªs Health Insurance Plans said insurers in discussing the bill had had åÛåÏsignificant concerns on how it would work operationally.åÛå         The outlook for the legislation is unclear in the Senate where Democrats running for re-election in 2014 are looking for a way to help consumers facing the loss of insurance policies that do not meet requirements of the 2010 law.         Senator Mary L. Landrieu Democrat of Louisiana was one of the first Democrats to break with the White House and offer her own proposal which would allow people to keep their current plans indefinitely.         However after the presidentåÛåªs turnabout on Thursday many Senate Democrats said they were waiting to see if additional legislation was necessary and quick action in the Senate is not expected.         House Democrats on Friday used a procedural maneuver to offer a plan of their own called åÛåÏLandrieu lite.åÛå It was similar to the presidentåÛåªs proposal in its approach and it gave Democrats some political cover in that it showed them taking action on the issue.ÌâåÊ         The Democratic proposal which was rejected by Republicans would have allowed people who like their current plans to retain them for a year. Under the Democratic proposal unlike with Mr. UptonåÛåªs bill insurers would not be allowed to sell plans that previously faced cancellation to new customers.

Dorit Ron a computer scientist at the Weizmann Institute and Adi Shamir a pioneering cryptographer who is a member of the  applied mathematics faculty at the Institute will publish a paper Sunday exploring how the 29-year-old Mr. Ulbricht who was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in October and has been charged with a murder-for-hire scheme and  narcotics-trafficking acquired and protected the estimated millions he made in commissions operating Silk Road. The researchers say Silk Road at the time of Mr. Ulbricht‰Ûªs arrest had sales of $1.2 billion generating $80 million in commissions. A huge run-up in the value of bitcoin in the last month has exponentially increased those amounts.  However the researchers added they believe the F.B.I. has seized only about 22 percent of the commissions they have identified and that they  themselves have only been able to trace about a third of the total. The Silk Road site which has been called an ‰ÛÏeBay for drugs‰Û was intended to permit any kind of anonymous transaction between buyers and sellers of illegal goods or activities. It was shut down  when the F.B.I. arrested Mr. Ulbricht who used the Internet identity ‰ÛÏDread Pirate Roberts‰Û while he was sitting in a public library in San Francisco near his home. The two scientists have been exploring the web of financial transactions produced by bitcoin the anonymous currency that  has drawn the attention of both law enforcement and federal regulators in recent months. Their research is made possible by the fact that while bitcoin is designed to protect the anonymity of buyers and sellers the actual transactions are public. Earlier this year the researchers obtained a complete listing of all bitcoin transactions and have since been exploring the ‰ÛÏgraph‰Û of those interactions in an attempt to gain statistical insights into user behavior in the anonymous financial market. After Mr. Ulbricht was arrested last month the scientists used public information to begin tracing Silk Road-related transactions. Among their discoveries was a particular transfer to an account controlled by Mr. Ulbricht from another that had been created in January 2009 during the very earliest days of the bitcoin network which was set up the previous year. Although the authors state that they cannot prove that that account belongs to the person who created the bitcoin currency it is widely believed that the first accounts belong to a person who identifies himself as ‰ÛÏSatoshi Nakamoto‰Û but who has remained anonymous and has not been publicly heard from since 2010. Individual bitcoin is generated using a cryptographic algorithm that requires computer-processing power and that insures that each coin remains unique and cannot be copied. After seizing Mr. Ulbricht‰Ûªs computer the F.B.I. spent several weeks analyzing data determining that the laptop contained a digital wallet with 144336 bitcoin currently valued at more than $122 million which the agency has attempted to freeze. In tracing various transactions made to and from Mr. Ulbricht‰Ûªs account the authors found an intriguing one involving the transfer of 1000 bitcoin which would have been worth $60000 when it was made on March 20 of this year but is now worth roughly $847000. They write: ‰ÛÏSuch a single large transfer does not represent the typical behavior of a buyer who opens an account on Silk Road in order to purchase some narcotics (such buyers are expected to make an initial deposit of tens or hundreds of dollars and to top the account off whenever they buy additional merchandise). It could represent either large-scale activity on Silk Road or some form of investment or partnership but this is pure speculation.‰Û The mysterious account that made the investment had at one point accumulated 77600 bitcoin mostly through ‰ÛÏmining‰Û operations an amount which would now be worth approximately $64 million. ‰ÛÏThe short path we found suggests (but does not prove) the existence of a surprising link between the two mysterious figures of the bitcoin community Satoshi Nakamoto and DPR‰Û the authors write referring to Mr. Ulbricht as the Dread Pirate Roberts. In addition to the curious transaction which they say they cannot explain the authors said they discovered that much of the bitcoin accumulated by Mr. Ulbricht has remained beyond the F.B.I.‰Ûªs grasp. The scientists note that for technical reasons seizing and controlling bitcoin from a computer is a much greater challenge for law enforcement than illicitly obtained cash stored in a safe. With bitcoin its very design may  make it possible for its support community to move to thwart law enforcement or any resale of  the digital tokens. In addition the scientists speculated that the reason the F.B.I. had not recovered all Mr. Ulbricht‰Ûªs bitcoin might be that he was using a second computer that has not been located. Dr. Ron and Dr. Shamir noted that despite the fact that the F.B.I. closed the original Silk Road black market a second ‰ÛÏSilk Road anonymous market‰Û has been created since. Satoshi Nakamoto‰Ûªs actual identity remains a hotly debated topic among Internet researchers. A number of individuals claim to have discovered his true identity but those assertions have either been denied or ignored by those named. The F.B.I. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Four Americans died in the Sept. 11 2012 attack including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.         The moves come after weeks of criticism directed at a åÛåÏ60 MinutesåÛå report which was based on an interview with a hired security agent Dylan Davies whose comments to CBS News were later discredited.         CBS did not specify the length of the leave of absence for its two staff members nor whether they would continue to be paid. In general television correspondents do not lose salary unless they are suspended.         Beyond Ms. Logan who has been a rising star at CBS News the review could have implications for the leadership of Jeffrey Fager the chairman of CBS News who is also the executive producer of åÛåÏ60 Minutes.åÛå Mr. Fager sent an email to the staff on Tuesday saying: åÛåÏAs executive producer I am responsible for what gets on the air. I pride myself in catching almost everything but this deception got through and it shouldnåÛåªt have.åÛå         He added: åÛåÏWe are making adjustments at åÛåª60 MinutesåÛåª to reduce the chances of it happening again.åÛå         Mr. Fager has enjoyed a strong reputation both inside and outside CBS News division for emphasizing a hard news approach on the networkåÛåªs news programs but one fallout from the discredited report may be continued questions about his dual role as both the top executive at CBS News and the person in charge of its highest-rated most profitable and best-known program åÛåÏ60 Minutes.åÛå         One area likely to be examined is the potential addition of a specific executive outside of the program itself who would vet the pieces about to be presented on åÛåÏ60 Minutes.åÛå That position existed for years inside CBS News headed most recently by Linda Mason. But after Ms. Mason retired from the network at the start of 2013 that level of oversight over åÛåÏ60 MinutesåÛå was eliminated.         The review of the Benghazi segment conducted by CBS NewsåÛåªs executive director of standards and practices Al Ortiz was unstinting in its evaluation of the report which Mr. Ortiz called åÛåÏdeficient in several respects.åÛå         Perhaps chief among the deficiencies according to Mr. OrtizåÛåªs review was that the account Mr. Davies gave to Ms. Logan and Mr. McClellan differed from versions he had provided both to his employer Blue Mountain and to the F.B.I. This discrepancy Mr. Ortiz writes åÛåÏwas knowable before the piece aired.åÛå         In a previous interview with The New York Times Mr. Fager said CBS had tried talking to the F.B.I. in advance of the report in an effort to determine what Mr. Davies had told the agency. The networkåÛåªs sources led the program to believe that the account given to the F.B.I. was åÛåÏin syncåÛå with the interview Mr. Davies gave to åÛåÏ60 MinutesåÛå Mr. Fager said.         In defense of its report CBS said earlier that it had been duped by Mr. Davies. Mr. Ortiz contradicted that by saying CBS could have and should have been able to verify Mr. DaviesåÛåªs account before presenting him as a reliable source.         åÛåÏThe wider reporting resources of CBS News were not employed in an effort to confirm his accountåÛå Mr. Ortiz wrote. He concluded: åÛåÏLogan and producer Max McClellan told me they found no reason to doubt DaviesåÛåªs account and found no holes in his story. But the team did not sufficiently vet DaviesåÛåªs account of his own actions and whereabouts that night.åÛå         The report also criticizes Ms. Logan for not adequately substantiating her conclusion that Al Qaeda took part in the attack and for making a speech in October 2012 that took a position on the attack and then participating in a story in which she would have been expected to be objective about the facts of the attack.

Besides the fact that I played guard and Martin is a tackle I was also perplexed because well he is a 6-foot-5 312-pound professional football player and I am a political reporter for The New York Times who barely cracked 200 pounds at the height of my high school glory days.         Then there is the fact that I have åÛåÏNYTåÛå in my Twitter handle ( @jmartnyt ) and my history nerd avatar is a picture of Lyndon B. JohnsonåÛåªs two beagles Her and Him perched on the south lawn of the White House.         All this had done little to stop a flood of Twitter messages aimed my way in the weeks since news broke that the other Jonathan Martin had left his team.         As reports of the treatment of Martin by a fellow lineman the more improbably named Richie Incognito became the biggest story in sports my åÛåÏ@åÛå mentions on Twitter began including about an equal mix of hang-in-there notes of encouragement and pointed inquires about the robustness of my manhood.         Since the Dolphins were defeated by Tampa Bay 22-19 on Monday night though there has been less good will åÛåÓ and their fans have become even more pointed.         åÛåÏU got a beagle dog as ur profile pic n ur in the nflåÛå wrote @calli_631 who also used a vulgarity to accuse me of ruining the DolphinsåÛåª season. Somebody named RunRickyRun (handle: @LordGexs) was a bit more delicate about my namesakeåÛåªs absence from MiamiåÛåªs offensive line. åÛåÏThe Dolphins need ya back ASAP!!!!! @jmartnyt @68INCOGNITO.åÛå         Apparently when you type åÛåÏJonathan MartinåÛå into the Twitter search form my account comes up with that of my Dolphins doppelgÌÄå_nger.         'Fins look turrible...even if  @jmartNYT  and  @68INCOGNITO  were playing they wouldn't have a prayer  @jmartNYT  The  @nytimes  really needs to do something about it's locker-room culture. Stay strong man! At first I found the confusion quite amusing. So did my family. My wife Betsy is also a journalist and has been tickled about not only the continuing Twitter mix-up but has also gotten a kick out of how my byline was now in some unlikely headlines (åÛåÏIn the case of Jonathan Martin remember that even big guys cryåÛå).         Instead of correcting people on Twitter I have been reposting some of the more egregious but PG-rated misdirected messages. (There have been plenty of obscene ones too.)         And I have been fascinated watching the Twitter ecosystem work when people like @kyle_pacheco åÛåÓ who urged me with an expletive mixed in to handle my business like a grown man not a 5 year old åÛåÓ were upbraided by others on the microblogging site for having the wrong guy.         As the story has intensified and misplaced 140-character assaults have piled up though the misunderstanding has lost some of its charm. I feel bad for my fellow Jonathan Martin åÛåÓ lord knows what his Twitter feed looks like åÛåÓ but the whole affair has also been a reminder about how ugly discourse can be on the Internet. During campaign season nasty even abusive emails and Twitter messages are standard fare for political reporters. Partisans (or in this case fans) say things online they would never contemplate saying to the face of a stranger let alone one the size of the brawny Jonathan Martin. As one person said in a message to me this week it is åÛåÏkeyboard courage.åÛå         But I do not want to turn this into some tut-tutting riff on our ever-coarsening society. As an avid sports fan I found it pretty neat to receive a shout-out from Deadspin and to wake up Tuesday morning to find an email request to call into WFANåÛåªs åÛåÏBoomer and CartonåÛå morning show. (I did resist the temptation to drop in a åÛåÏlongtime listener first-time calleråÛå when I went on the air.)         Before I became entranced by history and politics my first passion was sports: playing backyard whiffle ball and sandlot football with my brother Jeremy and our friends; reading about games in the Sports section and poring over Sports Illustrated when it came in the mail each Thursday; and collecting cards and autographs from the players I admired. I still have close friendships with some of my high school football teammates. The bullying we received as underclassmen was mild åÛåÓ just the occasional dead fish left in our shoulder pads. I was not going to come close to the N.F.L. åÛåÓ I rode the bench for a single year of Division III college ball åÛåÓ but even as my career plateaued my love for the game has continued to grow. Just ask my wife who will see (endure?) her fifth football game of the fall this weekend.         All of this is to say that by my lights there are worse people to share a name with than a Stanford-educated former all-American who was taken in the second round of the N.F.L. draft. I was reminded of this Tuesday when I received a message from Gerry Sandusky a Baltimore sportscaster who is not related to Jerry Sandusky the former Penn State assistant who was convicted of sexually abusing boys.         åÛåÏI have walked where fate has now taken youåÛå wrote @GerrySandusky who surely had it harder than me.         What I have not done yet is send a Twitter message to the other Jonathan Martin. So Big Jonathan you have my best wishes. This too shall pass. You will surely be representing our name again on the field soon.         And to those of you who want to get in touch with Big Jonathan: he is  @J_Martin71 .

The ""pitchfork movement"" originally a loosely organized group of farmers from Sicily has been joined by other protestors including truckers small businessmen the unemployed low-paid workers and others who have staged rallies in cities from Turin in the north to Sicily in the south.         Grillo whose movement has no direct connection with the protests welcomed reports that several police officers took off their riot helmets and expressed sympathy with demonstrators on Monday.         ""Italians are on your side. Join them. At the next demonstrations tell your guys to take off their helmets and fraternize with the citizens"" he wrote on his popular blog. ""It will be an extreme peaceful and revolutionary signal and Italy will change"" he wrote.         Though there are no direct ties to Grillo's movement both tap into the growing anger in many parts of Italy after the worst recession in postwar history.         Apart from demanding the government be replaced and parliament dissolved the precise targets of the protests remain vague ranging from tax collection agency Equitalia and high fuel prices to privileged elites and the euro.         Protests on Monday were marked by a number of clashes with police who fired teargas but there were no reports of serious trouble on Tuesday.         A confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday called by Prime Minister Enrico Letta to confirm his parliamentary majority after Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party left the ruling coalition may provoke further tensions.         ""If the government wins the confidence vote on Wednesday and the politicians remain in place all the pitchforks in Italy will move on Rome for a peaceful invasion"" Danilo Calvani one of the organizers told the daily Corriere della Sera.         His remarks were later contradicted by other members of the movement leaving it unclear whether there would be any direct reaction to Wednesday's vote but they underlined the tense climate facing the government as it seeks to push on with economic reforms.         Italian media reported that the ""pitchfork movement"" was backed by political groups including the hard-right Forza Nuova party but organizers denied any political links.         ""This is a movement of Italian people and that's it. We dissociate ourselves completely from these extremist parties like Forza Nuova which actually favor the system with the things they say"" Calvani said.         Letta has warned repeatedly that opposition to the government and the EU is growing strongly fuelled by sacrifices needed to keep public finances in order and which could result in a massive anti-EU vote in next year's European parliamentary elections.

The drug Sovaldi from  Gilead Sciences  will allow at least some patients infected with the liver-destroying virus to be treated with pills only doing away with weekly injections of a drug that can have  debilitating side effects .         åÛåÏTodayåÛåªs approval represents a significant shift in the treatment paradigm for some patients with chronic hepatitis CåÛå said Dr. Edward Cox director of the office of antimicrobial products at the F.D.A.         But the greater convenience and effectiveness comes at a price.         Gilead said the wholesale cost of Sovaldi which is known generically as sofosbuvir would be $28000 for four weeks åÛåÓ or $1000 per daily pill. That translates to $84000 for the 12 weeks of treatment recommended for most patients and $168000 for the 24 weeks needed for a hard-to-treat strain of the virus.         åÛåÏThis is unbearable to the health care system and it is completely unjustifiedåÛå said Michael Weinstein president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation which runs treatment clinics in the United States and abroad and has previously clashed with Gilead on the price of its drugs for  H.I.V.   The Initiative for Medicines Access and Knowledge a legal group based in New York recently filed a motion to try to block patenting of the drug in India. If it succeeds generic manufacturers in India will be able to manufacture cheap copies of the drug for distribution there and in some other developing countries.         Gilead said the price was fair given the drugåÛåªs higher cure rate and that the total cost for the 12-week regimen was åÛåÏconsistent with and in some cases lower thanåÛå the cost of some other regimens for  hepatitis  C. It said it would offer financial assistance to some patients.         Some three million to four million Americans many of them in middle age are believed to have a chronic hepatitis C infection though many do not know it. The virus slowly damages the liver leading to  cirrhosis  and in some cases to  liver cancer . But it often takes decades before any damage is noticeable and many people never experience a problem.         Globally at least 150 million people have hepatitis C.         Sovaldi was obtained by Gilead in an $11 billion acquisition of a smaller company Pharmasset. The high purchase price raised eyebrows when the deal was announced in 2011 but it has vaulted Gilead to the lead in a heated race to develop all-oral treatments for hepatitis C.         AbbVie Bristol-Myers Squibb Merck Johnson & Johnson and others are also developing all-oral regimens for hepatitis C that could reach the market in the next one to three years.         Some analysts expect Sovaldi to become one of the best-selling drugs in the world. Matthew Roden an analyst at UBS said in a note on Friday that annual sales could surpass the record of around $13 billion achieved by  Lipitor  from Pfizer in its peak year.         Sales are expected to be strong from the start because many patients on the advice of their doctors have been putting off starting treatment until Sovaldi became available.         One person waiting is Tom Espinosa a building inspector in Oakland Calif. He has tried the existing drugs and some experimental ones without success so this drug might be his last chance. His liver is already deteriorating badly but he is hoping the new drug will stop the progression.         Other companies are trying to get at least a little piece of GileadåÛåªs bounty. Merck Roche and Idenix Pharmaceuticals are separately claiming that Sovaldi infringes on patents they hold. Should any of those companies prevail it is expected they will receive royalties not keep the drug off the market.         Until two years ago the treatment for hepatitis C consisted of 24 to 48 weeks of weekly injections of interferon alfa combined with daily tablets of ribavirin. Neither drug was developed specifically to treat hepatitis C. The combination cured about half of patients but the side effects including flulike symptoms  anemia  and depression could be severe.         Sovaldi and newer drugs work by inhibiting enzymes produced by the hepatitis C virus. This is the same approach that was used to make drugs for H.I.V. As in H.I.V. two or more of these drugs for hepatitis C must be used together to prevent the virus from developing resistance.         Cure rates with Sovaldi a polymerase inhibitor are over 80 percent though success and treatment duration depend in part on which strain or genotype of the virus is involved.         For genotypes 2 and 3 which together account for about 20 to 25 percent of cases in the United States SovaldiåÛåªs label recommends the drug be used with ribavirin. This will constitute the first all-oral interferon-free treatment for hepatitis C. Genotype 2 will require 12 weeks of treatment and genotype 3 will need 24 weeks.         For genotype 1 which accounts for more than 70 percent of American cases Sovaldi is supposed to be used with injected interferon and ribavirin. But the treatment is for only 12 weeks instead of 24 or 48 and the cure rate is about 90 percent for newly treated patients.         The label however says that genotype 1 patients who are ineligible for interferon can be treated for 24 weeks with Sovaldi and ribavirin. Wall Street analysts had not been expecting an all-oral regimen to be endorsed for genotype 1 patients.         The side effects seem mild though the clinical trials to date have not been able to distinguish the effects of Sovaldi from the drugs it was taken with.         Ribavirin requires several pills taken more than once a day. Gilead hopes to combine Sovaldi with another drug it is developing into a single pill that can be taken once a day and cure most cases of genotype 1.         Results of clinical trials testing how that combination pill works are expected in the coming weeks. If all goes well that drug could get to market by the end of next year.

He shook the hands of a group of Hispanic teenagers sitting in the front row welcoming them like old friends. The teenagers who had been brought to the country illegally by their parents as young children had come the day before to lobby Mr. Tipton to support a broad immigration overhaul.         åÛåÏYou were there yesterday!åÛå he said to one of the teenagers who were dressed in red and had already attended several other events in his district. åÛåÏWell thanks for taking the time. Did you have a good drive?åÛå He turned to another member of the group. åÛåÏI have not got you to smile onceåÛå he said offering a smile of his own before moving to the front of the room to start his meeting.         Mr. Tipton has come to know the immigration advocates in his district åÛåÓ and their issue åÛåÓ well. As House Republicans have all but ruled out the possibility of passing any sweeping legislation before the end of the year immigration advocates are operating with an increased sense of urgency. Their goal is to pressure lawmakers like Mr. Tipton to support an overhaul creating a call for action from Republican House members that they hope Speaker John A. Boehner and his leadership team will find impossible to ignore.         But persuading Mr. Tipton a two-term lawmaker who rode into office on the  Tea Party  wave in 2010 to support any broad immigration legislation will be a tough sell.         In an interview at his Pueblo office he said he was åÛåÏcalling for immigration reform a long time agoåÛå but has yet to make up his mind on the crux of the debate: what to do with the 11 million immigrants already in the country illegally.         åÛåÏWeåÛåªve got some that were looking for a better life but they broke the laws to this countryåÛå he said. åÛåÏThat canåÛåªt be without penalty.åÛå         Mr. Tipton has shown some willingness to compromise on the question of the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers who were brought here by their parents as young children. He said he would handle their plight åÛåÏcompassionately.åÛå         Democrats perhaps optimistically hope to get Mr. Tipton to sign on to the broad bill they recently introduced which includes a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country. Immigration advocacy groups hope to show him that there could be political consequences if he does not take steps to help overhaul the nationåÛåªs immigration system.         According to the most recent census Mr. TiptonåÛåªs district which covers nearly the entire western half of the state as well as part of its southern border with New Mexico is 24 percent Hispanic. Combined with the large agricultural businesses on the Western Slope the demographic forces alone would seem to compel Mr. Tipton to support some form of immigration overhaul. President Obama won the state narrowly in both 2008 and 2012 and Mr. Tipton won re-election last year with 53 percent of the vote.         This month a coalition of immigration advocates as well as labor and religious groups inaugurated the åÛåÏCost of InactionåÛå a voter education and outreach campaign that targets nine House Republicans Mr. Tipton included to push for a vote on an immigration overhaul before the end of the year. Though the Senate passed its own broad immigration bill in June with bipartisan support immigration advocates have become increasingly frustrated with the House which has made little progress on legislation of its own and is unlikely to take a vote this year.         åÛåÏWe feel that to move them we have to awaken the electoral vulnerability that Republicans face both specific Republicans that have large and growing immigrant electorates and also the party as a national partyåÛå said Tom Snyder the immigration campaign director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. one of the groups behind the campaign. åÛåÏItåÛåªs very hard to think about them winning a presidential election with an immigrant electorate thatåÛåªs growing and overwhelmingly hostile to the party.åÛå

Oxford Instruments which designs and manufactures tools for industry and research had offered 500 pence per share in cash for Andor Technology last month but the approach failed to impress Andor's board.         Its final offer of 525 pence made on Friday was conditional on it winning the backing of the Northern Ireland-based company. It represents a 31 percent premium to Andor's share price in November before Oxford's approach was made public.

In October McKesson the health care services company based in San Francisco announced that it had acquired a controlling stake in Celesio from Franz Haniel & Cie. the company‰Ûªs majority shareholder and planned to start a tender offer for the remaining shares in a deal valued at $8.3 billion. But Elliott which has an economic interest in Celesio of more than 25 percent said it did not plan to tender the shares or convertible bonds owned by its affiliated funds under the current offer. ‰ÛÏSimply put Elliott believes that Celesio‰Ûªs shareholders and bondholders are not getting a fair deal at the current price‰Û the hedge fund said. ‰ÛÏGiven the value McKesson stands to gain from the substantial realizable economies of scale Elliott believes the price offered fails to appropriately compensate Celesio shareholders and bondholders for this upside potential.‰Û Celesio declined to comment and McKesson did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. The move by Elliott is the latest confrontation between activist shareholders and companies in Germany. Elliott was one of several hedge funds that pressed  Vodafone  to raise its 7.7 billion euro offer for the German cable operator Kabel Deutschland this year. But Vodafone was able to secure sufficient backing by investors in September for the deal to go forward following an initially tepid response to its offer. ThyssenKrupp the German steel maker and industrial giant has also faced pressure from investors over its share price after an ambitious but ill-fated effort to expand into the United States. While in a difficult overhaul the company sold its Alabama steel mill this month for $1.55 billion to a joint venture owned by Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal and  ArcelorMittal . The McKesson-Celesio tie-up would create one of the world‰Ûªs largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of logistics and services in the health care sector with annual revenue of more than $150 billion and about 81500 employees worldwide. The combined company would operate in 20 countries. Both companies act as distributors that provide generic branded and over-the-counter drugs to pharmacy chains independent pharmacists and institutions like hospitals. Celesio also operates Lloyds a British pharmacy chain. The deal is expected to help the combined company in terms of purchasing power and a broader worldwide reach. The two companies have limited overlap across the global and would maintain their own brands. On Tuesday Elliott said it believed that McKesson could afford to pay a ‰ÛÏfairer‰Û price to shareholders and bondholders and still have a deal that would be highly accretive as early as the first year of the combined company. Elliott noted that McKesson‰Ûªs market value had increased by about $7.7 billion since word of a possible deal emerged in October. The hedge fund also said stock prices had increased significantly since that time cutting into the premium offered by the deal. The hedge fund said there might be other ways to maximize value for shareholders and bondholders such as selling the wholesale business to one strategic bidder and the Lloyds pharmacy chain to another buyer. ‰ÛÏEven on a stand-alone basis Celesio has been a company on the mend for some time now and a turnaround was underway long before McKesson came in with its offer‰Û Elliott said. Some recent European deals in the health care sector have fetched significant premiums. After an investor buyout led by the  private equity  firm  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  of the British pharmacy chain Alliance Boots in 2007  Walgreens  the American pharmacy giant agreed to pay $6.7 billion last year to buy nearly half of Alliance Boots. McKesson is the largest of three wholesale distributors that account for 85 percent of the American drug market. Its main competitors in the United States include  Cardinal Health  and Amerisource Bergen. Celesio one of Europe‰Ûªs largest wholesalers competes primarily in Europe with Alliance Boots and Phoenix Pharmahandel. Shares of Celesio closed down 1 percent on Tuesday in trading in Frankfurt.

New rules proposed by the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service  would clarify both how the I.R.S. defines political activity and how much nonprofits are allowed to spend on it. The proposal covers not just television advertising but bread-and-butter political work like candidate forums and get-out-the-vote drives.         Long demanded by government watchdogs and Democrats who say the flow of money through tax-exempt groups is corrupting the political system the changes would be the first wholesale shift in a generation in the regulations governing political activity by nonprofits.         The move follows years of legal and regulatory shifts including the Supreme CourtåÛåªs Citizens United ruling in 2010 that have steadily loosened the rules governing political spending particularly by those with the biggest bank accounts: corporations unions and wealthy individuals.         But the proposal also thrusts the I.R.S. into what is sure to be a polarizing regulatory battle with some Republicans immediately criticizing the proposal on Tuesday as an attack on free speech and a ploy to undermine congressional investigations into the agencyåÛåªs handling of applications from Tea Party groups.         åÛåÏBefore rushing forward with new rules especially ones that appear to make it harder to engage in public debate I would hope Treasury would let all the facts come out firståÛå said Representative David Camp of Michigan the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.         Political spending by tax-exempt groups åÛåÓ from Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies co-founded by the Republican strategist Karl Rove to the League of Conservation Voters åÛåÓ skyrocketed to more than $300 million in 2012 from less than $5.2 million in 2006 according to the  Center for Responsive Politics .         Much of the money has been funneled through chains of interlinked nonprofit groups making it even harder to determine the original source.         And unlike political parties and åÛåÏsuper PACsåÛå political nonprofits are permitted to keep the names of donors confidential making them  the vehicle of choice for deep-pocketed donors seeking to influence campaigns in secret .         The new rules would not prohibit political activity by nonprofits.         But by seeking to establish clearer limits for campaign-related spending by groups claiming tax exemption the I.R.S. proposal could have an enormous impact on some of the biggest groups forcing them to either limit their election spending or register as openly political organizations such as super PACs.         A spokesman for Crossroads declined to comment as did officials at other political nonprofits.         Nick Ryan the founder of the American Future Fund which spent at least $25 million on political advertising last year said åÛåÏUnfortunately it appears that the same bureaucrats that attempted to suppress the speech of conservative groups in recent years has now put together new rules that apply to (c)4 groups but do not apply to liberal groups like labor unions.åÛå         åÛåÏI wish I could say I am surprisedåÛå Mr. Ryan added åÛåÏbut I am not.åÛå The final rules are unlikely to be issued until after the 2014 election after a public comment period.         The administrationåÛåªs proposal would apply to nonprofits organized under Section 501(c)4 of the tax code which are granted tax exemption in exchange for devoting themselves to the promotion of åÛåÏ social welfare .åÛå         Under current rules promoting social welfare can include some political activity along with unlimited amounts of lobbying. Some of the largest political nonprofits åÛåÓ like Americans for Prosperity backed by the conservative philanthropists Charles and David Koch åÛåÓ have used that provision to justify significant expenditures on political ads.         But under the new proposal a broad swath of political work would be classified as åÛåÏcandidate-related political activityåÛå and explicitly excluded from the agencyåÛåªs definition of social welfare. Those activities include advertisements that mention a candidate within 60 days of an election as well as grants to other organizations making candidate-related expenditures.         åÛåÏDepending on the details this could be dramaticåÛå said Marcus S. Owens a former chief of the I.R.S.åÛåªs exempt organizations division.         The rules could also affect more traditional  conservative and liberal advocacy organizations  including Tea Party groups whose complaints of harassment by I.R.S. employees prompted the  resignation of several high-ranking I.R.S. officials last spring . Distributing voter guides for example would automatically count as political activity.         Fred Wertheimer the president of Democracy 21 a watchdog group praised the proposal as åÛåÏan important step forward.åÛå He added åÛåÏEnormous abuses have taken place under the current rules which have allowed groups largely devoted to campaign activities to operate as nonprofit groups in order to keep secret the donors funding their campaign activities.åÛå         Administration officials described the new proposal as a response to complaints åÛåÓ including objections from the TreasuryåÛåªs own inspector general after the Tea Party controversy åÛåÓ that the existing regulations were too vague leading to inconsistent or arbitrary enforcement. The I.R.S. would be better equipped to enforce the rules the officials said if they were clearer while nonprofit groups would be better able to comply.         åÛåÏThis proposed guidance is a first critical step toward creating clear-cut definitions of political activity by tax-exempt social welfare organizations"" said Mark J. Mazur the assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy.         The final guidance could also include a more precise definition of how much political activity a 501(c)4 group is permitted to engage in while still maintaining its tax exemption.         Many election lawyers and their clients use an unofficial rule of thumb: If a tax-exempt group spends less than 50 percent of its budget on political activity then its primary purpose is not winning campaigns.         Some activists have argued that a rule requiring 501(c)4s to spend no more than 15 percent of their budgets on political activities would be closer to the letter and spirit of existing law.         Some lawyers said they worried that the new rules particularly those that could apply to grass-roots organizing could unfairly burden bona fide social welfare groups. Others suggested that tighter restrictions on social welfare groups would only hasten the migration of political money into other kinds of entities whose campaign spending is not subject to I.R.S. jurisdiction.         Mr. Owens now a tax lawyer in Washington said the I.R.S. proposal would have one certain consequence: more business.         åÛåÏIåÛåªm looking forward to a very profitable new yearåÛå he said.

The deal which will now be presented for approval by an Afghan grand council of elders starting on Thursday came after days of brinkmanship by Afghan officials and two direct calls from Mr. Kerry to President Hamid Karzai including one on Wednesday before the announcement.         Just the day before a senior aide to Mr. Karzai had said the Afghan leader would not approve an agreement unless President Obama sent a letter acknowledging American military mistakes during the 12-year war. But on Wednesday Mr. Kerry emphatically insisted that a deal was reached with no American apology forthcoming.         åÛåÏPresident Karzai didnåÛåªt ask for an apology. There was no discussion of an apologyåÛå Mr. Kerry said. åÛåÏI mean itåÛåªs just not even on the table.åÛå         After a war that stands as the longest in American history the security agreement defines a training and counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan lasting at least 10 more years and involving 8000 to 12000 troops mostly American.         Despite the sometimes harsh criticism from Afghan officials during the negotiations the agreement includes concessions that the Obama administration could not win from Iraq during a similar process in 2011 leading to the final withdrawal of American troops there.         Now the United States has at least an initial agreement from Afghan officials that American soldiers will not face Afghan prosecution in the course of their duties. And United States Special Operations forces will retain leeway to conduct antiterrorism raids on private Afghan homes åÛåÓ a central American demand that Afghan officials had resisted and described as the last sticking point in negotiations.         In the end the Obama administration and the Karzai government had more reason to agree than disagree according to officials on both sides. American officials do not want to see Afghanistan again become a haven for terrorists after it spent billions of dollars and thousands of lives in the war. And the Afghan leadership knows that more than $4 billion in annual international security assistance would simply not flow absent an American military presence to account for it.         Still domestic political risks remain for both presidents today as well. Some in Afghanistan already criticize Mr. Karzai as the political agent of a long-term foreign military presence. And Mr. Obama must explain to a nation weary of war why he is pressing for a continued military deployment albeit a smaller one than advocated by American military commanders.         Further there is an immediate risk to the deal itself: The bilateral security agreement must now be approved by the Afghan council known as a loya jirga. About 3000 elders and leaders all vetted by the Karzai government will meet in Kabul for the next three days to weigh the agreementåÛåªs language and it is sure to face at least some criticism.         åÛåÏWe have agreed on the language that would be submitted to a loya jirga but they have to pass itåÛå Mr. Kerry said.         Draft language of the security agreement that was  posted on the Afghan Foreign Ministry website  on Wednesday night differed substantially from earlier working documents made available to journalists seeming to ease off several Afghan demands that officials had publicly described as untouchable. Still it was unclear whether the posted draft reflected the wording that will be handed out to loya jirga delegates on Thursday morning.         On the issue of American searches of Afghan homes the draft proposal avoids the blunt prohibition previously offered by the Afghans which had stated: åÛåÏNo detention or arrest shall be carried out by the United States forces. The United States forces shall not search any homes or other real estate properties.åÛå

But that is an old one. More recently there are modern intrusions and fading memories of the donkeyåÛåªs role even here in the highlands of northeastern Portugal where for centuries indigenous Miranda donkeys helped farmers plow fields and carry goods.         After decades of neglect and some argue misunderstanding the fate of the donkey has come to resemble that of its human counterparts in hard-pressed European hinterlands: threatened by declining population and dependent for its survival on yes subsidies from the European Union.         Now in an era of austerity even donkeys have been swept up in the debate over just how far the European Union should go to maintain its farming regions which are facing cuts to their financial support. The aid this year amounts to $78 billion or 43 percent of the European UnionåÛåªs overall budget but under a recently struck deal the farm spending will fall slightly until 2020 to about $68 billion a year accounting for 38 percent of the unionåÛåªs budget.         Since 2003 the large and docile Miranda donkey named after the area where it lives Tierra de Miranda has been listed as an endangered breed. The Miranda which has white markings around its eyes and a thick coat that it sheds as it grows old has steadily been displaced by the tractor and other modern farming equipment.         And as young people continue to leave rural areas for the cities the donkeys are also being threatened because the farmers who once cared for them are growing too old to keep doing so.         åÛåÏI remember donkeys would be seen walking along most of our roads which really isnåÛåªt the case nowåÛå said Filomena Afonso the director of the animal genetic research department in PortugalåÛåªs Agriculture Ministry who estimated that the countryåÛåªs donkey population had fallen to a quarter of what it was in the 1970s.         Until recently the Miranda donkey was åÛåÏon a one-way road to extinctionåÛå said Miguel NÌÄå_voa a veterinarian and the director of an association that keeps 140 Miranda donkeys in two shelters one for breeding and the other for donkeys that are old or abandoned.         Thanks to the efforts of conservationists who have used national and European Union subsidies to breed Miranda donkeys the population has recently stabilized around 800. Farmers have also been able to apply for subsidies åÛåÓ $230 a year for each animal åÛåÓ which have persuaded more of them to keep their donkeys despite their dwindling worth as farm labor.         Without those subsidies åÛåÏit would make no economic sense to keep my donkeys however attached I am to themåÛå said GonÌÄå¤alo Domingues a 70-year-old farmer who has two Mirandas. Still another farmer Camilo da Igreja sold his two donkeys in October after hip surgery left him too weak to look after them.         In reality at a cost of about $650 a year it makes little economic sense to keep a donkey even with the subsidies experts say. åÛåÏFarmers now own donkeys out of love rather than for the subsidiesåÛå said Javier Navas a veterinary scientist who is preparing a doctoral thesis about donkeys at the University of CÌÄå_rdoba in Spain.         Conservationists say that donkeys remain under threat not only in Southern Europe but across the Western world.         åÛåÏPeople just donåÛåªt realize that the whole donkey species is in an endangered situation in EuropeåÛå said Waltraud Kugler a Switzerland-based project director at the SAVE Foundation a European animal conservation organization.         The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations lists 53 donkey breeds spread across Europe including Russia and some former Soviet republics. Ms. Kugler said her organization estimated that about 30 European breeds were at risk each with a population under 1000.         It has not helped Ms. Kugler said that the donkey has suffered from a bad image which has left it little studied by scientists. åÛåÏThe donkey is seen as the stupid animal of the pooråÛå she said åÛåÏand that is a reputation that is very hard to get out of peopleåÛåªs heads.åÛå

In the midst of a victory tour after winning the 2013 Man Booker Prize for her second novel åÛåÏThe LuminariesåÛå Ms. Catton had not yet fully adjusted to being an object of attention or even to being allowed to stay in a fancy hotel as she described it.         åÛåÏDo you think theyåÛåªd bring us coffee upstairs?åÛå she said.         They would.         Ms. Catton who has long hair a thick New Zealand accent that renders åÛåÏwentåÛå as åÛåÏwintåÛå and a manner that is both forthright and whimsical is something of a literary curiosity. At 28 she is the youngest person and only the second from New Zealand to win the prize: the starriest fiction award going bringing a check for Ìâå£50000 (roughly $80000) and incalculable benefits in sales and exposure. (The other New Zealander to win was Keri Hulme for åÛåÏThe Bone PeopleåÛå in 1985 åÛåÓ which happens to be the year Ms. Catton was born.)         Ms. CattonåÛåªs winning novel is an unfashionably ambitious 834-page behemoth of a book that is both a murder mystery written in the Victorian style of Dickens or Wilkie Collins and a virtuoso exercise organized åÛåÓ excitingly or irritatingly depending on your perspective åÛåÓ according to the astrological signs of its characters and the position and movements of the planets above 19th-century New Zealand.         Set in the gold rush town of Hokitika the book begins on a stormy night when a seasick spooked traveler stumbles upon a secret meeting of 12 uneasy men. There are multiple mysteries afoot åÛåÓ a rich man has disappeared; a prostitute has been found near death in the street; and a supposedly penniless hermit who turns out to have been very rich has died suspiciously åÛåÓ and each of the 12 is implicated in one way or another. Told in overlapping åÛåÏRashomonåÛå-like narratives the rest of the book concerns itself with how and why.         The Man Booker judges called åÛåÏThe LuminariesåÛå åÛåÏextraordinary luminous vaståÛå and many reviewers have been thoroughly dazzled by it including the author Bill Roorbach who wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Ms. Catton had created åÛåÏsomething utterly new.åÛå But there have been dissenters. åÛåÏA ship made of matchsticks in a bottle is a feat of construction but not necessarily a great work of artåÛå David Sexton said in The London Evening Standard.         Ms. Catton said that such talk does not really bother her. In her hotel room åÛåÓ the publisher had put her in a suite another exciting development åÛåÓ she described how the book came about. It began on one level with the stars: She wanted her characters to correspond to the signs of the zodiac and wanted the book to begin on Jan. 27 1866: a day when she discovered there was a triple convergence in the heavens three planets in Sagittarius. On another level she began with plot: She wanted a big meaty mystery.         The book jumps around chronologically. It begins with a chapter that is 360 pages long and ends with one that lasts for barely two. Characters come and go according to planetary movements. (The one representing Mercury sets as it were somewhere in the middle of the book and is never heard from again.) Readers get the sense of being expertly led around by someone much cleverer than they are.         Ms. Catton said that she herself does not believe that zodiac signs dictate peopleåÛåªs characters but just wanted to play with the idea while working hard to ensure that structure did not trump plot.         åÛåÏIf the characters are emerging out of the book seeming like puppets or exercises in what is essentially a fictional conceit rather than a human conceit then the whole book will failåÛå she said.         On the surface at least åÛåÏThe LuminariesåÛå is a far cry from her first book åÛåÏThe Rehearsal.åÛå Published in the United States when she was 24 that novel was a postmodern romp about a theater companyåÛåªs dramatization of a high school sex scandal that featured shifting perspectives and characters who shimmered in and out of identities and roles.

Together Jed Johnson and Alan Wanzenberg formed one of the most influential design partnerships of the 1980s and early 1990s making sensuous modern environments for celebrity and art world heavies like Richard Gere Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall Peter and Sandy Brant and Beth Rudin De Woody.         Mr. Johnson and Mr. Wanzenberg reinvigorated Arts and Crafts pieces by mixing Stickley with Ruhlman Fulper pottery with Jean Michel Frank. In so doing they jump-started that decadeåÛåªs appetite for all things Mission although as the architecture critic Paul Goldberger once wrote they not only collected furniture by Gustav Stickley and objects by Louis J. Millet åÛåÏbut they knew when to stop.åÛå         Their work was scholarly and passionate an education in early-20th-century furniture and contemporary art. And nowhere was it more vivid than in their apartment on West 67th Street a much-photographed turn-of-the-19th-century artiståÛåªs studio (albeit one with three bedrooms) filled with their signature arrangements along with custom pieces and a liberal sprinkling of Warhols.         As Mr. Goldberger said recently the two were åÛåÏan oasis of sanity amid that whole Warhol world two of the most centered people IåÛåªve known though in very different ways.åÛå Mr. Johnson was shy in public able to recall significant objects in a room but not the names of their owners. He was driven a little tortured and wickedly funny if you knew him well. Mr. Wanzenberg confident and verbal took himself more seriously in the way that architects sometimes do and Mr. Johnson delighted in teasing him. They had an ornery dachshund named Gus and a pair of houses on Fire Island. In 1996 when Mr. Johnson died in the crash of TWA Flight 800 he was 47 and Mr. Wanzenberg was 45.         Seventeen years later Mr. Wanzenberg now 62 has fully reshaped his life finally shedding that apartment which he sold a year ago in September to a client along with much of its contents for more than $4.3 million. He is living minimally in what he calls an åÛåÏunemotionalåÛå two-bedroom apartment on the 42nd floor of a bland rental building on West 60th Street that evokes nothing so much as Bob NewhartåÛåªs apartment minus Suzanne Pleshette. It is an act of downsizing that coincides with a memoir of sorts.  åÛåÏJourneyåÛå  out last month is a candid exploration of the people and places that have influenced Mr. Wanzenberg as an architect and a man from Angela Davis and Christopher Alexander to the memory of a bowl of lemons placed just so in Philip JohnsonåÛåªs Glass House. Of Jed Johnson he writes that when he died Mr. Johnson was the happiest he had ever been comfortable in himself and proud of all he had accomplished.         The other day Mr. Wanzenberg was sitting cross-legged on the sofa of his new apartment a slight figure in a T-shirt and jeans absent-mindedly hurling dog toys for an anxious wire-haired dachshund puppy named Skip. (DonåÛåªt be fooled she bites.) åÛåÏThis ability to shed was 16 years in the makingåÛå he said. åÛåÏIt holds up a mirror for people our age. Can you do it? Can you do it young enough so you still have the next phase of your life?åÛå         Mr. Johnson and Mr. Wanzenberg were in the their late 20s when they bought their apartment for $325000. åÛåÏIt seemed like a lot of money at the time and we did everything we could to make it workåÛå Mr. Wanzenberg said. åÛåÏWe moved in sort of with nothing. When Jed died it was horrific and chaotic and frightening and there was also just a lot of stuff. Things I maintained out of reverence to him and it was a lot. I did it with a certain energy and I didnåÛåªt despair over it but it was a lot.åÛå         It took six years he said to right himself after Mr. JohnsonåÛåªs death. He recalled the thousands of condolence letters many from young gay men who saw the couple as role models because they were so visible. The first year friends like Pat Hackett Angela Westwater and Fran Lebowitz buffered him. The second year he isolated himself worked too hard and brooded at home. The third year he started going out again. Maybe at year four he started dating though he said he was able to find fault with most of the men he met. åÛåÏI remember Fran saying to me åÛå÷IåÛåªm not good at relationships but you are. Right now you just donåÛåªt want to have a relationship. But when youåÛåªre ready youåÛåªll know how to do it.åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå         Ten years ago Mr. Wanzenberg met Peter Kelly a landscape architect during Gay Ski Week in Aspen Colo. a match so successful he said that it has boosted attendance at that particular event. Over time they have made a life in houses that look as much like them as the West 67th Street apartment was a portrait of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Wanzenberg: a bungalow in a surf town in Costa Rica; a kit house in upstate New York to camp in while they build a new house.         This apartment is fitted out on a desert-island premise: If you canåÛåªt take much with you what matters most? Out of the thousands of books from West 67th Street just a few have made the move: åÛåÏThe Invisible ManåÛå by Ralph Ellison; a bit of Cheever Dorothy Parker and Truman Capote. In the living room the sofa was designed by Mr. Wanzenberg to be a guest bed. In the monastic bedroom there are two tiny paintings at eye level by Forrest Bess and Farrell Brickhouse and a startling view of Lower Manhattan.         åÛåÏThe old apartment was a very internalized spaceåÛå Mr. Wanzenberg said. åÛåÏYou lost your sense of time which could be a good thing particularly during my recovery.åÛå         Recalling the apartments in the studio building Mr. Goldberger said åÛåÏThe best of them have decent light but none of them have any views. So Alan is getting the one thing he never had before: a great view.åÛå

The dining room is baldly lit with tables puzzlingly sidelined along the walls as if the looping Thai pop songs might inspire couples to shimmy across the open floor. A colony of miniature parasols hangs upside down from the ceiling. Banquettes and chair backs are hooded in tartans a salute not to Scotland but to the traditional checkered pha khao ma cloth used in Thailand as anything from a sarong to a hammock.         This is make-do assembled-overnight dÌÄå©cor and as it turns out a good sign: the focus here is the food.         The chef and owner Ratchanee Sumpatboon (known to friends as Poodam which means åÛåÏblack crabåÛå) grew up in Ubon Ratchathani in Isan ThailandåÛåªs northeast region. Prone to floods and drought and afflicted with arid soil Isan is one of the countryåÛåªs poorest areas. And its cuisine still underrepresented in New York is plain-spoken and resourceful. It is very different from the Thai food most Americans know: the elaborate rich dishes of central Thailand flooded with coconut milk.         Here are blimps of pork sausage the ground meat bolstered by cooked rice lemon grass and galangal and left to ferment until sour and almost floral. Scarlet and hot as longaniza they arrive with casings crisp from the frying pan thickly sliced and fanned out on the plate to show off their coarse interiors mottled with fat.         Som tum (green papaya salad) is familiar but it is particularly invigorating here in its crossfire of refreshing and shocking soothing and inflammatory. I could have happily eaten my way through all eight versions on the menu including one that ratchets up the salt and tang with pla raa fermented fish sauce and brined poo ma (blue crab). Larb a spicy meat salad comes in a number of manifestations but the classic is pork the meat minced so fine it could be a handful of rice saturated with lemon grass and lime juice and crunchy with roasted rice powder and prickling chile.         (A note on heat: When I ordered the waitress said åÛåÏYou want Thai spicy rightåÛå with a wink. But nothing I ate brought me to tears which was all right. Here firepower is just a facet not the dominating factor in a dish.)         Larb Ubol is a comeback of sorts for Ms. Sumpatboon after the shuttering in 2010 of her restaurant PoodamåÛåªs in Astoria Queens. (In between she cooked at Zabb Elee in the East Village.) At times her flavors achieve remarkable lucidity as with nam tok nuer thin curls of grilled beef anointed with lime fish sauce and palm sugar; and hot-sour gang om which looks like soup but has the wallop of curry.         Kra prao or holy basil brings undertones of licorice and cloves to a stir-fry of pork belly in which fatty bits and crispy edges vie for most-favored status. Dark gold hunks of fried catfish come stacked on a red curry that is saturated with hot chile paste and strewn with small burst balloons of Thai eggplants and twigs of fresh green peppercorns. Duck leg and thigh braised in soy and sweet-smoky-bitter Chinese five-spice is ho-hum at first until a dash of vinegar from the accompanying ramekin wakes it up.         Be wary of the staffåÛåªs recommendations. One evening a highly praised red snapper deep-fried whole was ruined by a kind of tamarind treacle the color of maraschino cherries; on another a whole tilapia was served seemingly unadorned beautiful but boring until a meager pool of sauce was belatedly discovered beneath it. (To be fair the sauce was vivid with chiles lime mint and cilantro and redeemed everything.)         There is pad Thai if you insist. But avoid pad kee mao whose name comes from the Thai word for drunk perhaps the sole state in which this pileup of sticky-sweet noodles could be appreciated.         Larb Ubol may not yet be sleek or consistent. But it is charming when for dessert a waiter in a straw fedora presents a boulder of vanilla ice cream encased in fried dough striped with chocolate sauce and ornamented with Fruity Cheerios. It made my table laugh long after we had demolished it.          Larb Ubol   480 Ninth Avenue (West 37th Street) HellåÛåªs Kitchen 212-564-1822  larbubol.com .

Kennedy IåÛåªd like to touch briefly on the greatest fiasco of his presidency: the Bay of Pigs invasion. No sooner had Kennedy taken the oath of office than he discovered that the Pentagon and C.I.A. were preparing to send 1500 Cuban exiles to invade Cuba. Though they would be greatly outnumbered by Cuban troops the American military and the C.I.A. assumed that once the attack began the Cuban people would rise up and overthrow Fidel Castro.         Kennedy was privately skeptical but he didnåÛåªt yet have the confidence in his own judgment to override the experts he was surrounded by. So he gave the go-ahead åÛåÓ only to discover that the experts didnåÛåªt know what they were talking about. The exiles were quickly routed America was humiliated and Kennedy was left to take the blame.         So far at least the implementation of the Affordable Care Act has been President ObamaåÛåªs Bay of Pigs. Led to believe that the preparation for Obamacare was on track Obama was blindsided when that turned out not to be the case. The website where people are supposed to enroll  HealthCare.gov  is a train wreck. People with individual policies  saw that they were set to be canceled  åÛåÓ and then couldnåÛåªt enroll in Obamacare because the website had collapsed. In other cases people discovered that even the least expensive plan available to them under Obamacare cost more than their old plan. And on and on.         There are two primary reasons Obamacare has gotten off to such a terrible start. The first is that it is one of the most complicated things that the federal government has ever tried to do; it was inevitable that there would be problems.         An insurance executive friend says that the systems Obamacare required were an order of magnitude more complex than even the most complicated insurance company systems. That complexity says Drew Altman the president of the Kaiser Family Foundation was necessitated by the many compromises that were required to pass the bill into law. Ted Marmor a former Yale professor and an expert on entitlement programs says that it has to coexist within the extraordinarily complicated åÛåÏpatchworkåÛå that is the American health care system.         Marmor was a young special assistant in the old Department of Health Education and Welfare when Medicare rolled out in 1966 åÛåÓ a rollout that was as smooth as ObamacareåÛåªs has been rocky. (åÛåÏOur biggest worry was getting Southern hospitals to treat black peopleåÛå Marmor told me.) Partly that was because Medicare was a relatively straightforward program. But Marmor also believes that it was because the men in charge of the new Medicare program were seasoned pros who knew how to get the job done.         Thus the second reason the Obamacare rollout has been so awful. åÛåÏThey put amateurs in chargeåÛå says Marmor. Obama would have been much better served if for instance he had called upon his friend Jeffrey Immelt the chief executive of General Electric to choose a team of specialists to lead the effort.         To even think that thought however requires management skills that this president has never shown. Nor has his initial reaction done much to instill faith. Calling on insurance companies to allow people  to keep their old insurance plans  åÛåÓ even after theyåÛåªve been canceled åÛåÓ is untenable. Even if state boards of insurance would allow such a move it still wreaks havoc with the calculations upon which premiums are set.         Obama also announced a deadline of Nov. 30 for fixing the problems with HealthCare.gov. But what will that really accomplish? It is an arbitrary deadline that will almost surely not be met åÛåÓ and will sow even more mistrust.         With each dayåÛåªs stories about the troubled rollout of Obamacare it is easy to believe that it is doomed. But itåÛåªs not åÛåÓ not by a long shot. åÛåÏWeåÛåªll know a lot more when we see what the roughly 15 million to 16 million people who are expected to get coverage that first year thinkåÛå says Altman. åÛåÏAnd they wonåÛåªt know themselves what they think about Obamacare until they start getting services.åÛå         Jonathan Gruber the M.I.T. economist who helped devise the Massachusetts health plan upon which Obamacare is modeled says the deadline that matters is March 31 2014. ThatåÛåªs when the individual mandate comes into play åÛåÓ meaning that people will either have signed up for health insurance or pay a fine. åÛåÏItåÛåªs way too early to panicåÛå he says.         Eighteen months after the Bay of Pigs President Kennedy was confronted with the Cuban missile crisis. Once again the generals in the Pentagon wanted him to respond militarily a route that was likely to lead to war with the Soviet Union. But this time he trusted his own judgment took a different path and defused the crisis. He had applied the lessons he had learned from the Bay of Pigs to the Cuban missile crisis.         As President Obama tries to turn Obamacare around that is the looming question: Can he learn?

The astronomer Geoffrey W. Marcy of the University of California Berkeley an experienced planet hunter and co-author of the study that generated the finding said that it åÛåÏrepresents one great leap toward the possibility of life including intelligent life in the universe.åÛå         But åÛåÏpossibilityåÛå is not the same as likelihood. If a planet is to be inhabited rather than merely habitable two basic requirements must be met: the planet must first be suitable and then life must emerge on it at some stage.         What can be said about the chances of life starting up on a habitable planet? Darwin gave us a powerful explanation of how life on  Earth  evolved over billions of years but he would not be drawn out on the question of how life got going in the first place. åÛåÏOne might as well speculate about the origin of matteråÛå he quipped. In spite of intensive research scientists are still very much in the dark about the mechanism that transformed a nonliving chemical soup into a living cell. But without knowing the process that produced life the odds of its happening canåÛåªt be estimated.         When I was a student in the 1960s the prevailing view among scientists was that life on Earth was a freak phenomenon the result of a sequence of chemical accidents so rare that they would be unlikely to have happened twice in the observable universe. åÛåÏMan at last knows he is alone in the unfeeling immensity of the universe out of which he has emerged only by chanceåÛå wrote the biologist Jacques Monod. Today the pendulum has swung dramatically and many distinguished scientists claim that life will almost inevitably arise in Earthlike conditions. Yet this decisive shift in view is based on little more than a hunch rather than an improved understanding of lifeåÛåªs origin.         The underlying problem is complexity. Even the simplest bacterium is at the molecular level staggeringly complex. Although we have no idea of the minimal complexity of a living organism it is likely to be very high. It could be that some sort of complexifying principle operates in nature serving to drive a chaotic mix of chemicals on a fast track to a primitive microbe. If so no hint of such a principle has been found in laboratory experiments to re-create the basic building blocks of life.         On the other hand if life arose simply by the accumulation of many specific chemical accidents in one place it is easy to imagine that only one in say a trillion trillion habitable planets would ever host such a dream run. Set against a number that big åÛåÓ and once you decide a series of unlikely accidents is behind the creation of life you get enormous odds very easily åÛåÓ it is irrelevant whether the Milky Way contains 40 billion habitable planets or just a handful. Forty billion makes hardly a dent in a trillion trillion.         So we are stuck. Life may indeed pop up readily in Earthlike conditions or it may be a fluke unique in the observable universe. Because we are a product of this cosmic accident we cannot conclude that Earth is typical. No statistical evidence can be drawn from a sample of one.         The easiest way to settle the matter is to find a second sample of life one that arose from scratch independent of known life. The inventory of extrasolar planets being discovered is an extremely useful first step. In the future our telescopes should be able to analyze the atmospheres of some of these planets for telltale signs of biological activity.         But evidence favoring lifeåÛåªs high probability could exist closer to home. No planet is more Earthlike than Earth itself. If life does pop up readily in Earthlike conditions then it should have started many times right here on our own planet. It could be that intermingled among the seething microbes all around us are some that are so biochemically different they could be descended only from a separate origin. You couldnåÛåªt tell by looking only by delving into their molecular innards and finding something weird enough to rule out a common precursor. The discovery of just a single åÛåÏalienåÛå microbe under our very noses would be enough to conclude that the universe was indeed teeming with life.         It would also address a deep philosophical question. Although the pathway from microbes to complex thinking beings like humans may still be a very difficult one at least we know the mechanism whereby it happens åÛåÓ Darwinian evolution. If microbial life is widespread in the cosmos we can expect that at least here and there sentient beings will evolve. We would then be much closer to answering that age-old puzzle of existence: Are we alone in the universe?

TheyåÛåªd love people to know how much fun theyåÛåªre having but they may not want the masses to force their way inside.         ÌâåÊ The automaker of course would happily drop the velvet rope and put more people into the driveråÛåªs seat of its cars åÛåÓ as long as the party didnåÛåªt turn into a Toyotathon filled with earnest dweebs arguing about hypermiling techniques.         Yet with the government mandating that automakersåÛåª fleets average 54.5 m.p.g. by 2025 even Mazda canåÛåªt focus exclusively on sporty hijinks at the expense of fuel economy. ThatåÛåªs been demonstrated in triplicate by its CX-5 crossover and the redesigns of its Mazda 6 midsize sedan and now its compact Mazda 3 hatchback and sedan.         All of these models have adopted MazdaåÛåªs Skyactiv technology which may sound like a sinister missile-defense system but is actually a bundle of improvements to the carsåÛåª powertrains chassis and aerodynamics.         Last yearåÛåªs Mazda 3 even on its farewell tour was beating up most of its competition. So itåÛåªs not surprising that the all-new 2014 edition forges strong claims as the front-runner among affordable small cars.         The 3 has grown better looking outside and more deluxe inside. The chassis is said to be 30 percent stiffer the cabin is quieter and weights have dropped by 60 to 100 pounds. The 3 is more powerful more aerodynamic and more advanced and comes with new active safety features.         But itåÛåªs the caråÛåªs yin-yang combination åÛåÓ an entertaining driving experience with much improved economy åÛåÓ that puts it over the top. Highway fuel economy has soared by as much as 10 m.p.g. to 41 m.p.g. with the standard 155-horsepower 2-liter Skyactiv-G engine in the 3i and to 39 m.p.g. with the 3såÛåªs 184-horse 2.5-liter.         I drove a winning pair of 3s: a 3i Grand Touring hatchback with manual transmission and a sticker price of $24635 including options and the 3s Grand Touring for $29185. With more grunt and notably stickier 18-inch tires åÛåÓ 3i models make do with 16-inchers åÛåÓ the 3s model remains the enthusiaståÛåªs choice at least until Mazda creates a higher-performance Mazdaspeed 3 version.         What the 3s models donåÛåªt yet allow is a manual transmission though Mazda has pledged to offer one later. But thereåÛåªs consolation in the automatic a novel 6-speed that blends functions of conventional and dual-clutch units. Paired with the 2.5 engine a pushbutton Sport mode holds gears and automatically downshifts while braking and there are paddle shifters behind the steering wheel.         The departing 3 was already handsome by the standards of its class aside from a goblin grin plastered across its grille. Plastic surgery has changed that grimace into a Mona Lisa smile. And like its striking new stablemates the 3 adopts MazdaåÛåªs Kodo design language a Euro-tinged whisper of touchable curves and intriguing shapes.         With its prominent hood scalloped sides and curvy hips the 3 recalls the beloved old BMW M Coupe spiced with a dash of Alfa Romeo. The front roof pillars are repositioned 3.9 inches toward the stern accentuating the new modelåÛåªs cab-rearward profile. A 2.4-inch stretch in the wheelbase and taller rear seatbacks enhance interior room and comfort.         Even the sedan a body style often relegated to grunt duty among affordable cars looks alluring.         Like the original 3 of a decade ago the new model carries the premium theme inside. And the Mazda meets modern expectations with design materials and features that are just-this-close to what youåÛåªd find in a midsize sedan.         The interior is clean softly padded and symmetrical including a small-radius sport steering wheel. Fealty to drivers shows in features like pedals that line up precisely with the seated driver. In this class only the  Volkswagen Golf  matches the MazdaåÛåªs naturally upright poised-for-action seating position. The MazdaåÛåªs stylish body-coddling sport seats åÛåÓ clad in cloth leatherette or leather åÛåÓ surpass the VWåÛåªs.         Drivers who prefer a co-pilot can choose electronic helpers including radar adaptive cruise control blind-spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert lane-departure warning automatic high-beam control and a new feature called Smart City Brake Support: Its laser system scans for potential low-speed collisions and can prepare for stops or even brake automatically at speeds from 2 to 19 m.p.h. ItåÛåªs the kind of system you expect on a luxury car not a mainstream compact.

Named to his new position on Tuesday Dan Ammann will fill what many analysts and investors saw as a gap in his resume by managing GM's regional operations around the globe and perhaps preparing himself to take over as CEO one day.         Ammann has tried to prove his ""car guy"" credentials in several ways including being one of only about 30 company executives who are certified to drive at high speeds at GM's Michigan test track. And he is a certified test driver at the famous Nurburgring Nordschleife racetrack in Germany.         GM did not make Ammann available to comment         Independent auto analyst Maryann Keller said that Ammann complements the skills of Mary Barra who will replace retiring CEO Dan Akerson in January.         ""He's a finance person in a No. 2 position because clearly that's the one thing in her resume that's lacking"" said Keller of the pairing of Ammann and Barra as GM's top leaders.         Someone familiar with the GM board's thinking said that Ammann 41 works ""amazingly well"" with Barra who will be 52 once she takes over as CEO.         ""They have complementary skill sets and the personalities are such that they work really well as a team"" said the person who asked not to be identified discussing the process.         In addition to running the regional units Ammann will have the Chevrolet and Cadillac brand operations and GM Financial report to him. Analysts welcomed his promotion as it keeps the highly regarded executive in the fold and gives him the operational experience many felt he lacked to round out his resume.         ""Who's to say that in 10 years he might not be the successor to Mary"" said the source. ""There's about a 10-year age difference between the two of them. It's perfect.""         Alan Baum an industry consultant said the enhanced role Ammann will fill shows that GM knows that it also needs to have someone with his financial expertise near the top.         ""How do you maintain what they call a fortress balance sheet while also investing in the product line and regional opportunities around the world? His non-automotive experience will remain in play"" said Baum.         An analyst who wished to remain anonymous said that the naming of Ammann as the second-in-command at GM was a nod to Wall Street.         ""They had to throw a bone to Wall Street"" the analyst said. ""I like Dan a lot. He's a smart guy but he's got a lot to learn about GM.""         Ammann will retain his CFO duties which he assumed in April 2011 until at least the company's next quarterly earnings report in early February. The New Zealand native joined GM in 2010 as vice president of finance and treasurer.         This promotion was announced a day after the U.S. Treasury said it had sold the last of its GM shares which could clear the way for the restoration of a common stock dividend for investors.

The man known as Capitol HillåÛåªs Dean Martin surrounded by his Cap Pack is having a late-night clam bake at Trattoria Alberto.         BoehneråÛåªs usual haunt on the Hill PeteåÛåªs Diner has become nowheresville since immigration protesters have been self-importing there to stalk the speaker.         åÛåÏBuddy boysåÛå Boehner says exhaling a Camel Ultra Light åÛåÏweåÛåªve got to do something about our trouble with broads. The way I figure it itåÛåªs the four of us cats against this one city.åÛå         His pallies Senators Richard Burr and Saxby Chambliss and Congressman Tom Latham nod in agreement as they attack their steaks.         åÛåÏI donåÛåªt know how Jay-Z and BeyoncÌÄå© can give up meat to go on a vegan cleanseåÛå marvels Latham a proud promoter of Iowa beef.         åÛåÏYou know what my idea of a vegan cleanse is?åÛå cracks Boehner. åÛåÏStaying far away from all the vegans I know.åÛå         The Cap Pack laughs uproariously but the guys get serious quickly because they know they have trouble. The worst sort of trouble. Dame Trouble.         åÛåÏSome of these punks and losers in the Tea Party who have joined up with us do not have a clue how to smooth talk dollsåÛå the speaker says in his sandpapery voice. åÛåÏWe need to wise åÛåªem up. Angry tomatoes are not small potatoes.åÛå         He takes a swig of merlot. åÛåÏWe lost seats in the House and didnåÛåªt win the Senate last time because of these creeps and bums running off at the mouth and they could hurt us againåÛå he says. åÛåÏI know it seemed like endsville for us after the government shutdown but all this trouble with Obamacare has got us back on top. King of the Hill. A-Number-One. Top of the Heap.         åÛåÏHeck things are looking so good I even filed for re-election this week. And I know the betting in this floating crap game was that I was going to cash out. No such luck crumbs.         åÛåÏThe only thing better than a nice set of gams and a little hey-hey with a mouse is being Speaker of the House even if itåÛåªs got a few louses.         åÛåÏAll we have to do now is finish off a nickel-and-dime budget deal pass a farm bill that makes food more scarce for the poor try to ram some Iran sanctions at the White House and then itåÛåªs scramsville for the holidays.         åÛåÏThe only thing standing in the way of a gas of a year next year is how we bamboozle åÛåªem on immigration and devise a scam to make the ladies think weåÛåªre not tramps. Nancy with the smilinåÛåª eyes is ready to take us apart for this stuff and PelosiåÛåªs no plaything. SheåÛåªs more like a well-mannered shark. We have to appeal to small-town girls city girls blue-blooded girls and the twists in the autumn of their years. ThatåÛåªs amore.         åÛåÏYou know you look around the Congress and there are a lot more females in the Democratic caucus than in the Republican caucus and some of our members just arenåÛåªt as sensitive as they ought to be.         åÛåÏFirst good night to rape talk legitimate or otherwise. Chicks donåÛåªt dig it. And vaginal probes? Too medical. No more scary medical talk except to smash Obamacare. Forget probes of any kind except into Benghazi and the I.R.S. LetåÛåªs have less ow-ee ow ow and more wow-ee wow wow.         åÛåÏI donåÛåªt want to see any more conservatives running for office acting like amateur gynecologists offering bogus biology lessons about how women have special powers to make rape sperm do U-turns. And put a drop cloth on frat-boy yucking it up like Scott Brown on Elizabeth Warren saying åÛå÷Thank GodåÛåª she kept on her clothes and didnåÛåªt pose nude like he did in Cosmo to pay for college.åÛå         In his stentorian Southern accent Chambliss chimes in: åÛåÏGee whiz! The hormone level created by nature sets in place the possibility for these types of things to occur.åÛå         Boehner blows a smoke ring and a gasket.         åÛåÏCool it SaxbioåÛå he snaps. åÛåÏThatåÛåªs just the kind of rigamarole IåÛåªm talking about.         åÛåÏAnd altar boy Paul Ryan and these 18-karat idiots trying to curb birth control? Birth control makes the world go round baby. We donåÛåªt want to be leading a party thatåÛåªs against sex. ThatåÛåªs a sure way to go home alone. Sex is popular. We can get away with saying no to a lot of things. No means no. But saying no to sex leads to bombsville.         åÛåÏThe way we run things we should have been tossed out long ago since most of the country thinks weåÛåªre living in the past. And itåÛåªs not a cool crazy swinginåÛåª past. ItåÛåªs a square uptight Mother Superior past.         åÛåÏSpeaking of Mother Superior weåÛåªve got to get the broads back in line before Hillary runs. ThatåÛåªs real woman trouble there.         åÛåÏAny questions? Good. LetåÛåªs do it my way.åÛå

At the  Georgia Institute of Technology  in Atlanta where he was a professor of electrical engineering Dr. Laskar did research on chip design. He mentored dozens of Ph.D. students and over the years started and sold a number of tech companies. The last one called Sayana created a promising wireless chip and was being courted by the likes of Samsung and Qualcomm.         But on May 17 2010 agents from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation wearing bulletproof vests raided his university offices. A parallel scene played out at Dr. LaskaråÛåªs home where his wife Devi Laskar found armed agents in her driveway. While agents went through the house and confiscated files and computer equipment she went to a coffee shop to call a lawyer.         åÛåÏWhat were they looking for?åÛå Dr. Laskar said in disbelief recounting the event recently. åÛåÏCash under the bed? Chips in the ceiling?åÛå         The day of the raid there was to be an auction for Sayana. It never happened. Instead Dr. Laskar was suspended without pay from his tenured position. He was later arrested on state racketeering charges and eventually fired by  Georgia Tech  accused of misusing university resources.         åÛåÏIt was devastating absolutely devastatingåÛå he said.         In one day his life was upended. But why it was upended åÛåÓ and why university officials and authorities in Georgia acted so aggressively åÛåÓ is still leaving people in high-tech circles scratching their heads.         It has been three years since Dr. Laskar now 50 was arrested and he has not been indicted. The statute of limitations in a case such as his is four to five years said Lauren Kane a spokeswoman for the Georgia attorney general. She said that there was a continuing criminal investigation but declined to comment further.         For Georgia Tech the story of Dr. Laskar appears to be a clear-cut case of a professor who broke its rules and had to go.         Matthew G. Nagel a university spokesman declined to provide an interview with an administration official to discuss Dr. Laskar because of continuing legal matters. He said Georgia Tech takes its responsibility for proper use of public funds seriously and responded appropriately.         åÛåÏWe can clarify that violations of this nature are not common and would typically result in dismissalåÛå he said.         Dr. Laskar for his part denies that he did anything wrong. But he struggles to come up with a good explanation for why the university got rid of him. It could be that he stepped on too many toes as he became more successful he said or perhaps the university bruised by an earlier financial scandal came down hard for fear of another one.         Or did he truly mess up?         Dr. LaskaråÛåªs downfall little known outside Georgia Tech and the clubby world of chip design is an extreme illustration of the misunderstandings åÛåÓ and legal risks åÛåÓ that academics-turned-entrepreneurs have to navigate as they try to turn classroom concepts into successful companies.         On one side are universities that want to make money from faculty research. On the other are commercial interests that donåÛåªt always play by the academic rules. In the middle are people like Dr. Laskar an ambitious man with one eye on Silicon Valley and the other on his academic work in Atlanta.         For professors who juggle academic and entrepreneurial responsibilities conflicts of interest are an occupational hazard. They can be accused of providing academic favors for students who agree to work for start-ups for little pay. And they run the risk that research grants intended for a university look as though they were used directly or indirectly to benefit the professoråÛåªs commercial interests.         åÛåÏThis is very delicate stuffåÛå said Oren Etzioni until recently a computer science professor at the University of Washington who founded several Internet start-ups while he was there.         Universities have faculty codes of conduct that provide general guidelines in these situations. Georgia Tech for example doesnåÛåªt want faculty members to spend more than 20 percent of their time on start-ups or other forms of consulting. Policy violations are usually handled through disciplinary actions but outright dismissals are rare professors at several research universities said. Unless a professor is clearly abusing his academic position for personal gain schools with strong track records of commercial success have a liberal attitude toward their academic entrepreneurs.         ThatåÛåªs why the actions against Dr. Laskar have puzzled people in his field.        
1.0,4.81,5.740714286,3.11,1157.277,0.352859135,1407.755,23.0,984.857,699.0,1454.588,32.0,The speakers at the fund-raising gala in New York last month had come to praise the guest of honor: the new president and chief executive of the International Rescue Committee David Miliband. Amid all the charity-circuit one-liners delivered by big-ticket names like Bill Clinton George Soros and Samantha Power a remark by Madeleine Albright the former secretary of state hit closest to home.         åÛåÏI would like to dispel the rumoråÛå Ms. Albright said åÛåÏthat David himself has sought refuge in America from that most terrible of democratic tyrannies the British tabloids.åÛå         She may be right but surely no one would blame Mr. Miliband åÛåÓ a former British foreign secretary candidate for leader of the Labour Party and newspaper torture victim åÛåÓ if escape had indeed been one of his motives for fleeing England at the end of the summer.         In London Mr. Miliband 48 could barely venture out for a loaf of bread without some newspaper or other analyzing his purchase through the noxious prism of the most publicly traumatic thing that has happened to him in recent years: his humiliating defeat at the hands of his younger brother Ed now 43 in the 2010 election for Labour Party leader (Ed Miliband still holds the job). The episode injected poison into LabouråÛåªs inner circle set up the brothers as the Cain and Abel of Westminster politics and all but ensured that the country was not big enough for the two of them.         Mr. Miliband is a household name in England. But in New York where he has installed himself his wife and their 6- and 8-year-old sons in a rented apartment on the Upper West Side he faces the opposite phenomenon: Except for super-keen followers of semi-recent Western European diplomatic history no one has any idea who he is. This includes fellow parents at his sonsåÛåª schools who initially at least failed to notice the foreign celebrity in their midst. (Mr. Miliband asked that his sonsåÛåª schools names not be published.)         åÛåÏItåÛåªs a bit of a different challengeåÛå he said recently over lunch at a Midtown restaurant near the organizationåÛåªs headquarters. åÛåÏIåÛåªm obviously much less a figure of interest for the American press. Here weåÛåªre trying to get intereståÛå he added alluding to his role at the International Rescue Committee åÛåÏwhereas there we were trying to shake off interest.åÛå         Mr. Miliband is a very English person his reserve and self-deprecation intertwined with self-assurance. He said sheepishly that he had recently apologized at the supermarket for buying just one item a carton of milk (the checkout clerk did not understand what he was sorry about). He used åÛåÏliftåÛå during the interview quickly switched to åÛåÏelevatoråÛå and said that his sons are moderating their accents: One recently reprimanded Mr. Miliband for mispronouncing the name of a school friend. åÛåÏGrahntåÛå Mr. Miliband said; åÛåÏGrantåÛå said his son.         The rescue committee where Mr. Miliband has embarked on his second act is one of the worldåÛåªs most prominent refugee-relief charities with a $450 million budget this year a work force of some 12000 people and a presence in 40 countries and 22 cities in the United States. Though a formidable force in the humanitarian world the I.R.C. now 80 years old has been overshadowed in the public perception by organizations like Save the Children and CARE. The plan is that with his international experience and gold-plated virtual Rolodex Mr. Miliband can bring in new sources of funding as well as raise the groupåÛåªs profile.         The position came at the right time for Mr. Miliband once viewed as a possible contender to be prime minister. Out of a government job when Labour lost the 2010 election and then out of a party job when his brother beat him as leader Mr. Miliband had become that most unhappy of Parliamentary creatures an underemployed once-important opposition-party backbencher.         Stuck in that unpleasant limbo he was casting around for something that would allow him to address the kind of åÛåÏbig knotty problemsåÛå that he dealt with as foreign secretary he said. He was restless and he had experience in the charity sector: His first job was as a policy analyst for a British group called the National Council for Voluntary Organizations.

Another question: But what if instead they just left?         He smirked then said: åÛåÏThe U.S. has come and will not go brother. It does not go. Therefore ask for your demands and donåÛåªt worry.åÛå         That unguarded moment in front of a friendly audience speaks volumes about the impasse between Mr. Karzai and his American allies.         In the face of a warning  delivered in person on Monday  by the national security adviser Susan E. Rice that the United States  would consider leaving no troops at all  in Afghanistan past 2014 if Mr. Karzai did not promptly sign a long-term security agreement he has made it clear that he considers it a bluff. Not only did he refuse to sign he added conditions including the release of all inmates from the GuantÌÄåÁnamo Bay prison camp.         He is in effect betting billions of dollars in international assistance that the United States does not want to go.         His close aides have echoed that assessment through the recent days of diplomatic crisis. (åÛåÏWe donåÛåªt believe  thereåÛåªs any zero option åÛå his spokesman Aimal Faizi said recently.) But their optimism was not widely shared in Afghanistan on Tuesday as Ms. Rice flew back to Washington with no promise of the follow-up talks Mr. Karzai said he wanted to pursue.         Even many of Mr. KarzaiåÛåªs friends were criticizing his refusal to conclude a deal.         Since Sunday Mr. KarzaiåÛåªs most high-profile critic has been a man widely considered to be his political mentor and godfather Sibghatullah Mujadidi. Mr. Mujadidi 89 was the chairman of the gathering of Afghan leaders the loya jirga that  approved  the security deal over the weekend and recommended that Mr. Karzai sign it by yearåÛåªs end.         But when Mr. Karzai refused and said he would continue negotiating with the Americans on new grounds Mr. Mujadidi stunned the president by vowing to quit his government posts and go into exile if the agreement were not signed in the next few days.         åÛåÏUnfortunately President Karzai did not see the interests of his country and heåÛåªs trying to enforce his personal opinions and wrongheaded ideas on usåÛå Mr. Mujadidi said. åÛåÏBecoming president made him prideful.åÛå         Some Afghan officials worried that their president who has made brinkmanship with the Americans his defining trait had finally gone too far.         åÛåÏMark my words if we do not sign this security agreement with the Americans things will get worse than Iraq and the 1990s Afghan civil waråÛå said Sayed Ishaq Gailani a member of Parliament from Paktika Province. He urged the Americans to remember that åÛåÏKarzai is not Afghanistan he is just another individual with illogical and illegal demands that are against all diplomatic norms.åÛå         åÛåÏWe donåÛåªt want the Americans to burn down the entire house to exterminate one louseåÛå he added.         If the Americans do completely withdraw at the end of 2014 leaving no long-term training mission and virtually guaranteeing that international aid would not flow the Afghans might face the disintegration of their security services. Some predict a descent into civil war or a possible Taliban resurgence.         The Americans risk losing long-term bases in Afghanistan and a staging platform for counterterrorism missions against Al Qaeda and other groups in the region.         Stephen Biddle a political science professor at George Washington University compared it to a game of chicken when two cars are driving head on at each other to see which one will swerve first.         åÛåÏNeither driver wants a wreckåÛå he said åÛåÏbut they are both willing to risk something they donåÛåªt want in order to get something they do want and that creates car wrecks occasionally.åÛå         Ahmad Behzad an influential member of Parliament from Herat Province said that a full withdrawal would mean the reversal of every significant achievement of the past 12 years of American presence. But he said he did not think that would happen. åÛåÏThe United States and NATO strategists know that a full withdrawal in the long term is not going to be in the interests of either sideåÛå he said.         Beyond that Mr. Behzad said Mr. Karzai will face a huge backlash from the Afghan public if he does not sign the security deal. åÛåÏPeople will pour into the streets and force him to signåÛå he said.         Each side has still left itself a way out. Ms. Rice did not say the Americans would definitely walk away after 2014 only that they would begin planning for the possibility.

The gesture symbolized the girlsåÛåª hope åÛåÓ their determination åÛåÓ that their lives would always be joined just as closely.         åÛåÏYou had this idea that IåÛåªll never forgetåÛå Kylee told Starr much later on. åÛåÏPeople move places and change careers for their spouses. And you said to me åÛå÷Why canåÛåªt we do that for our friendship?åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå         åÛåÏWe didnåÛåªt get reinforcement for that ideaåÛå Starr said. åÛåÏWe got a lot of pats on the head and åÛå÷Oh thatåÛåªs a nice idea girls but life happens.åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå         It does. And often the only people who go the turbulent distance with you there at almost every critical juncture are the ones who wear tags like mother or father sister or brother husband or wife. They have more motivation and more of an obligation to stick.         But sometimes it works out differently. Kylee and Starr each went on to marry and have kids but more than 25 years after their pact when they sat down in 2007 to speak about it they were living on the same street sharing the burdens that needed sharing and no more able to envision separate existences than they had been when they drank that illicit beer. If thatåÛåªs not family åÛåÓ real family åÛåÓ please tell me what is.         I read about them in a new book åÛåÏ Ties That Bind åÛå which showcases conversations like theirs from the StoryCorps project an evolving oral history that records pairs of individuals talking about the sacrifices each has made for the other the favors bestowed the forgiveness granted. Dave Isay the founder of StoryCorps culled about 40 of these encounters for the book which coincides with the projectåÛåªs 10th anniversary.         A slight majority of the pairs in the book are linked by DNA marriage or such. TheyåÛåªre kin in the conventional sense. But what struck me most forcefully was how many others had found extraordinary enduring intimacy outside of that context stretching the definition of family making clear that itåÛåªs not just or even chiefly about common genes common beds.         ItåÛåªs about common needs common generosity. ItåÛåªs an act of will as much as an accident of birth. ThatåÛåªs worth remembering during this merrymaking reunion-heavy season when åÛåÏfamilyåÛå is usually invoked in terms too narrowly traditional. They fail to recognize that former schoolmates fellow churchgoers neighbors or other friends can mean every bit as much to you as any actual relatives do. They fail to acknowledge how many people have been let down by those relatives and have forged a family of their own invention.         ThatåÛåªs true of Chelda who was 24 in 2009 when she and her best friend Georgia two years older recorded the conversation that appears in åÛåÏTies That Bind.åÛå         åÛåÏI remember growing up and picturing this fairy-tale lifeåÛå Chelda said mentioning two of televisionåÛåªs happiest tribes the Brady bunch and the Huxtables. åÛåÏBut I didnåÛåªt have the family network that I wanted.åÛå She decided that Georgia would fill the gap. She clung to her. And when she got pregnant unexpectedly during graduate school it was Georgia who rushed to her side and stayed there.         As good as we humans are at division weåÛåªre better still at connection. åÛåÏTies That BindåÛå shows this again and again even presenting the astonishing story of a woman in constant contact with the man who killed her only son and served 17 years behind bars for his crime. At the time of their recorded conversation in 2011 he was out of prison and living next door to her. She was calling him åÛåÏson.åÛå And he was professing his love for her and helping to fill the very hole in her life that he with a bullet had created.         åÛåÏOur relationship is beyond beliefåÛå she said.         It certainly didnåÛåªt follow any predictable script and neither did the relationship that Tim a former nurse has with Barbara whose husband a quadriplegic he once tended to bringing the couple a crucial comfort. When Tim later developed AIDS Barbara assumed the role of caregiver and moved him into her home. She spoon-fed him six times a day. They too are like mother and child.         In the book there are teachers and students whose closeness transcended and outlasted the classroom. ThereåÛåªs a mentally challenged woman Janice who has lived for more than a decade with Sadie the friend who essentially rescued her from a family that used her as an unpaid housekeeper seldom let her out into the world and went so far as to have her sterilized. The tenderness between the two women is palpable and breathtaking.         åÛåÏYour house is the White House to meåÛå Janice told Sadie last year when their conversation was recorded.         åÛåÏWeåÛåªre not biologically tiedåÛå Sadie said. åÛåÏWe are spiritually tied.åÛå Lucky for them lucky for all of us that twine can be as thick as blood.

Faus said the board would meet on January 20 to consider the proposals both of which would lift capacity from 98000 to 105000 and then be put to a fans vote.         ""We have ruled out making small changes as that would be more complex and worse for the fans who would lose 12000 seats"" said Faus the club's economic vice-president.         ""The cost of rebuilding would be 300 million euros ($413.14 million) or 600 million for a new stadium but that would be more expensive still with a new sports hall.         ""We will not make a decision it will be down to the fans.         ""The club can generate between 100 and 120 million euros annually and half of this could be spent on the sports project and the rest on preparing the surroundings.         ""We will not delay and we won't increase the prices for club members until 2016"" he added.         Faus said that either proposal could see the club earn an extra 30 to 35 million euros a year.         The board was also considering giving club members the chance to vote on whether to offer stadium naming rights for sponsors.         ""There is a general feeling among the board not to sell the name although surveys have shown it is not something that the fans value"" added Faus.         It is not the first time the club has weighed moving from their ageing ground which was opened in 1957.         Former president Joan Laporta considered a project by British architect Norman Foster but the plan never took off after disputes over rising costs of construction and payments.

I am looking at it now and the message is clear: as problems go this one is imaginary.         Some social conservatives embrace a seasonal victimhood this time of year complaining that Christians are continually being mugged by anti-Christmas atheists bearing court orders. But the map pinpoints only a handful of alleged secular assaults one of which is titled: åÛåÏSalvation Army Volunteer Using Smaller Bell After Business Owner Complains.åÛå         This yearåÛåªs big book on the subject is by Sarah Palin which makes it both best-selling and instantly passÌÄå©. The title (åÛåÏGood Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of ChristmasåÛå) is an attempt to spin a warm and fuzzy view of the War on the War but I say if youåÛåªre going there go all the way. Like FoxåÛåªs John Gibson who wrote åÛåÏThe War on Christmas: How the Liberal Plot to Ban the Sacred Christian Holiday Is Worse Than You Thought.åÛå         Palin does paint all attempts to remove religion from any aspect of the season as åÛåÏthe tip of the spear in a larger battle to secularize our culture and make true religious freedom a thing of AmericaåÛåªs past.åÛå She also takes a minute to lash out at åÛåÏsnickeringåÛå pundits who feel the whole åÛåÏHappy HolidaysåÛå versus åÛåÏMerry ChristmasåÛå issue is not a big deal. Such as the one who wrote a column in The Times under the headline åÛåÏMy Favorite War.åÛå Which O.K. was me.         åÛåÏGood TidingsåÛå is a rather small book but it still needs a lot of filler: recipes including one for smoked salmon spread and family anecdotes. (When Bristol announced she was pregnant Sarah initially wanted to make her get married but Todd said no.) Then there was the year Granddad was taken off to the hospital for what everybody feared was a heart attack but it turned out to be salmon poisoning.         As the teenaged Sarah Heath Palin spent one Christmas hoping to get a mini-tape recorder. Her parents forced her to wait until the very end to unwrap her big present which she discovered while the rest of the family watched and chortled was actually a dictionary. The moral as Palin tells it is that her parents wanted her to know that åÛåÏwords matter.åÛå It sounds to me as though there was a mean streak in the Heath clan which perhaps explains a lot.         Led by the American Family Association and Fox NewsåÛåªs Bill OåÛåªReilly conservative Christians have been encouraging boycotts of stores that do not directly connect their aim to sell massive amounts of clothes toys electronics and linens over the month of December with the birth of Christ. In her book Palin recounts the sins and redemption of Walmart which also gives her a chance to mention that in 2003 the chain gave its Wasilla outlet a special award for selling 325 miles of duct tape which averaged out to 314 feet per resident. ItåÛåªs the kind of detail I appreciate.         This year the American Family Association has been declaring war on Radio Shack for an alleged failure to mention Christmas enough and celebrating a victory over Gap Inc. (åÛåÏComplete turnaround!åÛå) A spokeswoman for Gap said in a phone interview that the company instructs its staff to cry åÛåÏMerry Christmas!åÛå and åÛåÏHappy Hanukkah!åÛå and åÛåÏJoyous Kwanzaa!åÛå to customers which seems like a lot of effort at an already stressful time of the year. She also volunteered that the companyåÛåªs Old Navy brand ran TV ads last year åÛåÏfeaturing the Griswold family from National LampoonåÛåªs åÛå÷Christmas Vacation.åÛåª åÛå         So more mentions of the birth of the Savior while promoting sweaters for the whole family.         WeåÛåªd be a slightly happier nation if we could just feel good about the ways that Americans make this swell-but-stressful season work. Palin brags about her role as Christmas Warrior when she was mayor of Wasilla. åÛåÏI knew IåÛåªd be criticized and challenged for sanctioning the Nativity scene. ... But I didnåÛåªt careåÛå she writes. This was perhaps in part because there actually appeared to be no criticism or challenge whatsoever.         Given the fact that approximately three-quarters of the American population is Christian it seems highly unlikely that anyone will be in danger of forgetting that Dec. 25 commemorates the birth of Christ. But you canåÛåªt make the entire period running from Thanksgiving to New Year a religious occasion. The holidays are for everyone: nearly six weeks of assorted celebrations many of them simultaneously sacred and secular.         The season makes room for the complexity of our far-flung lives. You can rendezvous with long-separated siblings at SeaWorld one weekend take your spouseåÛåªs parents to church the next. You can make a tradition out of anything from football to family dinners to re-running åÛåÏItåÛåªs a Wonderful Life.åÛå Some years you might have a better time than others but the point is that everybody will be back to do it again in 12 months.         Happy holidays.

People with back problems and people who donåÛåªt have back problems yet.         Are you the kind of person who will develop back problems? Take this easy test.         l. Are you alive?         2. Are you getting older?         3. Do you ever pick things up?         If you answered åÛåÏyesåÛå to any of these questions back problems are probably in your future. ( Eighty percent of adults  experience them at some point.)         åÛåÏBut IåÛåªm not the kind of person who has back problems!åÛå you protest.         ThatåÛåªs what everyone says. Right up until the moment his or her back goes out.         What did mine in was decades of library work. Hours spent lifting small weights (books). And heavier weights (reference books). Not to mention carrying carton after carton of donated books from the vestibule where patrons dropped them off into the storage room. All of which I handled with the casual assumption that I was and would always be Superwoman.         I thought nothing of stooping hoisting up a mammoth box of books then lugging it the length of the library.         People tried to warn me. åÛåÏWatch your back!åÛå a patron would caution as I staggered by with a large box.         åÛåÏThanks!åÛå I would respond while thinking: åÛåÏBack problems? Me? Not a chance.åÛå         Then one morning I got out of bed and I couldnåÛåªt stand up. My back refused to bear my weight. I hit the floor then crawled back into bed and phoned my sister who has coped with back problems for years.         åÛåÏIåÛåªll be right there with a heating padåÛå she said. åÛåÏFirst you need to heat it. Then you need to ice it. And then you need Michele.åÛå         Michele is her (and now my) physical therapist.         After working with Michele and dutifully doing my exercises each morning IåÛåªve gotten to the point where I can function again.         But IåÛåªll never be the same. I can no longer sit for any length of time before the pain starts creeping in. Or lift anything heavier than a Yorkiepoo. Which is say five pounds. ThatåÛåªs two library books. (Unless youåÛåªre talking about the first volume of Mark TwainåÛåªs autobiography which at close to 800 pages is closer to a Bichon.)         As my co-workers zip around with big stacks of books IåÛåªve learned to limit myself to two one in each hand.         Or else I use a book cart which is what I should have done in the first place. (My boss used to pester me to use a book cart. Naturally I ignored her. You hate to think that your boss could be right about anything.)         I know what youåÛåªre thinking: åÛåÏThereåÛåªs nothing wrong with MY back!åÛå         Nonsense. YouåÛåªre just one sports injury crazy dance move or well-intentioned offer to help a pal carry that armoire up to the attic from Broke-Back Boomer.         When your back does inevitably go out hereåÛåªs my advice: Do your exercises. Never lift heavy objects. And most important channel Nancy Reagan: Learn to  åÛåÏ Just Say No.åÛå         I used to be the first one to pitch in to get the job done.         Help move your ex-boyfriendåÛåªs marimba out to the curb? IåÛåªd love to. Hold those six bags of groceries for a moment while you get the front door open? No problem. Hoist Voldemort your labradoodle into the mud room sink for a paw wash after he comes in from a backyard romp? Easily done!         But now if it needs to be picked up lifted carried or moved IåÛåªm no longer   available .         And donåÛåªt even think of asking me to go with you to Ikea.         My man just became a grandpa for the first time. He can hold baby Brock for hours. I can hold him for at most 10 minutes.         By the time my son places my own first grandchild in my arms I want to be able to hold him. Easily. For a good long time.         So IåÛåªll continue to do back-strengthening exercises. And to refrain however much I want to from helping you lift that fallen tree limb off your Toyota. Not only that but for the sake of my back IåÛåªve done two things I thought I would never do.         Practice yoga. And acquire wheeled luggage.         I always thought people with rolling suitcases looked rather silly like grown-up toddlers with a pull-toy. Now IåÛåªm the proud owner of a sky blue Samsonite Lift Easy with multidirectional spinner wheels. And while IåÛåªm way too impatient by nature to actually want to slow down breathe deeply and assume the Upside Down Turtle or Backward Facing Squirrel youåÛåªll find me on the mat every Monday and Wednesday for åÛåÏGentle Yoga With Georgette.åÛå         Should I have accepted these changes more gracefully? You bet. After all IåÛåªm pushing 60. Nobody expected my Grandmother to hoist   large objects  at this age. If she needed something moved she thought nothing of asking for help. And we were always happy to lend a hand.         But IåÛåªm a boomer. Forever young. And a feminist. (I am Woman! Hear me Roar! Then watch me lift this heavy box!)         Even so the strength I really need now is the strength to cope with my own limitations. To ask for help when I need it. (And to refrain from hollering åÛåÏWatch your back you idiot!åÛå every time I see you go by carrying anything heavier than a Yorkiepoo.)

She was gravely ill. Cancer. It had spread to her brain I was told. From where it wasnåÛåªt clear. She was on life support. By early afternoon her childhood friend and next-door neighbor had posted on Facebook:         åÛåÏThis isnåÛåªt good bye itåÛåªs just see u later. God saw ur suffering n decided u should suffer no more.åÛå         The woman with the cancer was dead. She was 45.         The news snapped the holiday cheer out of me. I realized that I like so many get so caught up in the torrent of dinners and parties and sales and gifts this time of year that I sometimes forget how truly ephemeral and precious life is that life itself is the gift.         And I forget how truly blessed I have been by whatever gods there may be. It doesnåÛåªt mean that there havenåÛåªt been troubles and trials. There have. But I have had it in me to overcome. And for the mere fact of having enough and to all the people in my life who have informed my character and given me courage I need to give a measure of thanks. So here goes:         IåÛåªm thankful for the basic things like food and shelter and warmth when it is cold and medicine when I am sick. I grew up staring poverty squarely in the face but I fear that far too many have no familiarity åÛåÓ or even empathy åÛåÓ with what it means to be poor in this country or in any country.         Poverty is a diabolical predicament that not only makes scarce oneåÛåªs physical comforts but drains away oneåÛåªs spiritual strength. It damages hopes and dreams and having deficits among those things is when the soul begins to die.         I am thankful for a loving mother who hasnåÛåªt always gotten things right but who taught me how to grow in grace and learn from getting things wrong. She taught me what it means to live selflessly and without pride and to find joy in giving joy.         IåÛåªm thankful for the folks at whose knees I spent my preschool days being imbued with wisdom long before I knew what wisdom was åÛåÓ gnarled hands moving gracefully through the air the way a fishåÛåªs fins move through water gently touching my shoulder or grabbing my hands and steering me clear of danger.         IåÛåªm thankful for the teachers who saw me when I felt invisible who reached through my sorrow and my sadness and in that darkness lit a fire in me. These are teachers who to this day encourage me like family more than faculty.         They are teachers like Mrs. Dawson who calls me after every one of my television appearances and says åÛåÏHello baby this is your grandma.åÛå She continues with some version of: åÛåÏWe saw you. We were looking right at you. Everyone in town is proud of you. We love you.åÛå         They are teachers like Mrs. Thomas åÛåÓ now down in health but still up in spirit åÛåÓ whom I called last month. She remembered my first weeks in her fourth grade class after IåÛåªd changed schools: åÛåÏYou hardly let go of my skirt hem.åÛå I didnåÛåªt recall that and I asked her how she could. She responded without skipping a beat åÛåÏCharles you never forget your babies.åÛå         IåÛåªm thankful for these teachers who refuse to release me who continue to inculcate me with love and encouragement teachers whom I will spend the whole of my life attempting to honor.         IåÛåªm thankful for my three beautiful children who amaze me daily with their development into smart honest loving people and who remain my reason for rising when I ache and pushing forward when I would otherwise stop.         IåÛåªm thankful for great friends and the love of family the deepest bonds of earthly connection who provide the greatest defense when the storms of life rage and the walls of the self are buffeted.         IåÛåªm thankful for the spirit and resilience and fortitude of this countryåÛåªs unbreakable slaves of the not-too-distant past whose blood courses through my veins whose dreams I live whose lives I honor.         I am thankful that my work is my passion and that what I do for pay I would probably do for free.         And I am thankful for all of you the regular readers of my columns åÛåÓ and the new ones as well åÛåÓ who affirm me and challenge me and chastise me. In the end you make my voice clearer and my resolve stronger.         Thank you all.

It seems that some time ago an American family celebrating its first Thanksgiving in Paris ordered a turkey from the neighborhood butcher. The butcher offered to fill it with a special poultry stuffing and roast it.         åÛåÏBien sÌÄåÈr!åÛå the wife told the butcher.         When the couple picked it up on Thanksgiving Day the turkey was perfect with a golden crackly skin on the outside and juice oozing from the inside. The special stuffing was indeed special. It was made not with ordinary fowl livers but with foie gras.         The turkey cost $200.         No matter what the price Americans canåÛåªt ignore Thanksgiving. The French donåÛåªt quite get it. One veteran Parisian butcher insists on calling it le NoÌÄåÇl AmÌÄå©ricain åÛåÓ the American Christmas.         I explain that unlike almost all of their official holidays Thanksgiving marks neither a religious event nor a military victory. ItåÛåªs the closest thing we have to a holiday without an agenda.         It is also the only American day designated to bring together family and friends for a home-cooked afternoon meal.         The humorist Art Buchwald said it best in a newspaper column in November 1952. Using free-form translations he told the French all about åÛåÏKilometres DeboutishåÛå (Miles Standish) the Fleur de Mai (Mayflower) the Pelerins (Pilgrims) and the Peaux-Rouges (Redskins). He said that Thanksgiving was the only time of year when Americans åÛåÏeat better than the French do.åÛå         For the French however every Sunday is a day to bring together family and friends for a home-cooked afternoon meal. And they would never ever pile the courses on the plate all at once.         And yet Thanksgiving could be French. The holiday was inspired by traditional fall harvest festivals in Europe. It is all about the preparation and consumption of ritual foods. (At the first Thanksgiving in 1621 the settlers at Plymouth Colony joined with Native Americans to eat venison waterfowl lobster clams berries and other fruit pumpkin squash and of course wild turkeys.)         The French understand turkey. France is the leading turkey producer in the European Union. The breeds are named after their colors and regional origins: the Bourbonnais Black for example or the Red Ardennes.         Long ago turkey replaced goose as a staple of the traditional French Christmas table along with champagne raw oysters smoked salmon and foie gras. Poultry farmers time the hatching of turkey eggs to bring their free-range birds to maturity towards the end of December. If you want one a month earlier itåÛåªs likely to be embarrassingly small. Otherwise youåÛåªll be stuck with a farm-raised version perfectly acceptable if you donåÛåªt crave the gamey taste and darker flesh of birds that have run wild.         Over the years even the most Frenchified American expatriates in Paris have embraced the holiday.         Alice B. Toklas had HÌÄå©lÌÄå¬ne the cook to roast the Stein-Toklas Thanksgiving turkey but made the stuffing herself. Since Gertrude Stein could not decide whether she wanted chestnuts mushrooms or oysters in the stuffing Alice a great cook threw in all three. The stuffing became one of her signature dishes.         Julia ChildåÛåªs most traumatic Thanksgiving in Paris was her first åÛåÓ but it had nothing to do with food. It was a party hosted by Paul and Hadley Mowrer. (He was a newspaper columnist she the first Mrs. Ernest Hemingway.) More than half the guests were French and Julia was so frustrated by her inability to communicate that she signed up for private French lessons at Berlitz immediately afterwards.         Just about every American in Paris seems to have a Thanksgiving story.         There was the American businessman who smuggled a turkey fryer from the United States and procured gallons of American peanut oil from the American military commissary in Brussels. He deep-fried the bird in the courtyard of his apartment complex.        
1.0,4.9,5.745248227,3.89,1443.588,0.357615894,1582.17,26.0,1379.156,738.0,1466.805,30.0,WASHINGTON åÛåÓ Tens of thousands of new electric cars are zipping into traffic this year and with them come a trunkful of strategies about how to recharge them.         There are at least four ways to go: recharging slowly through a standard 120-volt wall socket the type a consumer would use for a hair dryer; buying a faster 240-volt home charger about the size of a garden gnome for several thousand dollars; plugging into the same 240-volt charger in a public parking space but paying a price; or using a $30000 superspeedy public charger that takes only minutes but is not widely available.         The only consensus is that the more opportunities there are to recharge the better the sales of vehicles that can generally go fewer than 100 miles between plug-ins.         Not surprisingly the chief executive of a company that has bought up thousands of high-voltage devices thinks they are the best way to recharge. The CarCharging Group based in Miami has quietly purchased four companies with networks of chargers 13430 in all.         CarCharging has installed the high-voltage devices some dressed up to mimic a gasoline pump in underground parking garages where drivers plug in and pay for the electricity through a device that resembles a credit card. But the price 49 cents a kilowatt-hour åÛåÓ roughly four times what people pay for electricity in their homes åÛåÓ often makes the electric car more expensive per mile than the gasoline car it replaced.         The high-voltage devices though take less than an hour to charge a car that has driven 20 miles from a personåÛåªs home to their office enabling garage valets who park the cars to move them around charging several during the day.         Such public charging has an advantage over the 240-volt charger that a car owner can install in a garage or car port said Michael D. Farkas the founder and chief executive of the CarCharging Group because in a private home the charger is typically used for just one car. åÛåÏWeåÛåªre able to amortize it over several usersåÛå Mr. Farkas said. The smaller home chargers typically take two or more hours to recharge a car.         CarCharging installs chargers like soft drink machines retaining ownerships and revenue and giving landlords a cut. Another company ChargePoint manufactures the devices (including some for CarCharging) and sells them usually to landlords to use as they please. A shopping mall owner for example could set up a machine to dispense electricity free for two hours and then bill at a high rate after that encouraging shoppers to visit but not hog the charger. An employer might program the machine to provide free electricity but only to authorized users.         Strategies differ said Dimitrios Papadogonas vice president of marketing for ChargePoint but åÛåÏitåÛåªs not surprising that thereåÛåªs some confusion because itåÛåªs a new industry and itåÛåªs getting sorted out.åÛå         Mr. Papadogonas and Mr. Farkas agreed that public charging was needed because some potential buyers could not plug in at home. A  new study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University  in Pittsburgh and the University of Glasgow found that in the United States less than half of vehicles have a regular off-street parking spot at a place owned by the driver where a charger could be installed.         Stepping into this picture last month eight states announced  a joint effort to bolster electric cars  partly by requiring the installation of chargers in certain categories of buildings like multifamily apartment structures.         But it is a tough business. Last month CarCharging bought the Blink networkåÛåªs 12450 chargers because its owner Ecotality had gone bankrupt despite $114.8 million from the Energy Department to help build the network. (Blink  had trouble keeping its chargers in good repair.  ) In February CarCharging bought Beam Charging which has contracts with 400 parking garages. In April it bought EVPass with chargers in central and upstate New York and 350Green with 600 installations in the Midwest and California.         But Mr. Farkas acknowledged that 49 cents a kilowatt-hour was equivalent to the cost of gasoline at current prices for a car that gets 21 miles per gallon a substandard rate in 2013. The company is considering offering a flat monthly rate $100 for off-peak charging and $150 for anytime charging which he said mimicked the gasoline expense of a typical car. Still the car would have to go about 600 miles a month for the driver to break even difficult in a car that cannot make long trips.

He does shower yes but he finds baths unmanly just like soccer åÛåÓ or any other sport that does not require players to crash into one another like angry apes and beat their chests.         For years he coached our son Cade in football shouting at his boys to åÛåÏHit them low take them down.åÛå He watches soccer only because our daughter Raye plays. She has what her coaches call åÛåÏgrit.åÛå This makes Peter proud.         Before every game we remind her about excessive body play.         åÛåÏKeep your arms inåÛå Peter warns as I nod approvingly. Then he whispers åÛåÏGo kick some butt.åÛå He holds up his palm. She throws a punch good and hard thumb out so it doesnåÛåªt break just as he taught her. Then they beat their chests and grunt.         So my expectations were low when on a cold Minneapolis day last winter I dialed PeteråÛåªs number at his office to make an unusual request.         åÛåÏHeyåÛå I said. åÛåÏWhatåÛåªs up?åÛå         åÛåÏNothing. Just working.åÛå         åÛåÏO.K. I just called to say hi.åÛå         åÛåÏHi.åÛå         åÛåÏHiåÛå I said. åÛåÏSo do you feel like going to Costa Rica on a  yoga  retreat?åÛå         And I held my breath.         I felt as if I had been holding my breath for more than 20 years since I got my first job in New York and soon after learned that at 56 my mother had AlzheimeråÛåªs disease. I moved back home to help care for her and began telecommuting from Minneapolis.         Next I met and married Peter. Then came PeteråÛåªs alcoholism. And two infants. And my fatheråÛåªs cancer. And tensing up every time the phone rang.         After two decades of illness and death of car pool lanes and hockey rinks of figuring out dinner and what to do while my taciturn husband learned how to live without a drink after giving up running because it hurt my knees and sugar because it made me sick and traveling because it made me insane trying to convince myself I would not die while away here I was again holding my breath.         åÛåÏDo I want to go on a yoga retreat?åÛå he repeated. åÛåÏNot really. But IåÛåªll go if itåÛåªs important to you.åÛå         So we went neophytes both because we had become strangers in marriage because our therapist told us we needed to say åÛåÏyesåÛå to life more and because on the cusp of turning 50 I needed to remember how to breathe.         On our first night our group gathered for a ceremony that involved sitting cross-legged on cushions and holding stones in our hands. Our teachers lit candles and told us to close our eyes.         I peeked at Peter. I was supposed to be envisioning the blue in my body but instead I was thinking: åÛåÏPlease donåÛåªt let them ask us to join hands. Or chant.åÛå         The next day Peter did his first downward dog. There were cats and cows and instructions on breathing: åÛåÏIn through the nose out through the nose.åÛå         Later we took a group surfing lesson. I was dreading it. I am terrified of sharks and scared of waves. But I wanted to say yes to life so I found myself lying on a rental board on the beach that scratched my arms with an instructor named Ricardo telling us to åÛåÏpop up.åÛå         Twenty minutes later we walked into the water. åÛåÏRemember to shuffleåÛå Ricardo told us. åÛåÏTo avoid the stingrays.åÛå         One by one Ricardo brought the others into the ocean åÛåÓ shuffling shuffling. One by one they popped up wiped out and disappeared before reappearing and heading back to shore.         Then it was my turn. Ricardo held my board. My heart raced. åÛåÏRelax your shouldersåÛå he said. Like everyone else he told me to breathe. åÛåÏTrust meåÛå he said as he let me go. åÛåÏYouåÛåªre not going to die out here.åÛå         I thought åÛåÏHow do you know?åÛå And then I popped up. My feet splayed. My arms flew out. I held my breath. I did everything I was not supposed to do. But I was up. For 15 seconds I rode on top of the ocean bobbing and swaying in harmony with the universe åÛåÓ until it claimed its due and I crashed.

SundayåÛåªs defeat in San Diego only made it official a sloppy and fitting pratfall in a mess of a season that dawned with six successive losses.         Now the Giants have not qualified for the playoffs in four of the last five seasons and the downward spiral appears to be growing worse. Not since 2004 åÛåÓ when  Eli Manning  was a rookie åÛåÓ have the Giants been eliminated from playoff contention so early in the season.         That year was also  Tom Coughlin åÛåªs first as the coach. So playing out the string åÛåÓ three games remain beginning with a home game against the 11-2 Seattle Seahawks on Sunday åÛåÓ is uncharted territory for a vast majority of the roster.         It has left some players not knowing exactly how to feel. Wide receiver Victor Cruz one of the few Giants who has had a season to be proud of was asked Monday if the Giants would gain strength from upsetting the high-flying Seahawks.         åÛåÏIt would put a smile on our faces and understand that this is something that we could have done all yearåÛå Cruz answered.         But he continued åÛåÏIt would kind of make it more disappointing because we didnåÛåªt take advantage of playing like this all year long.åÛå         Losing complicates everything.         At times like these it is often said that coaches can use the final games to assess younger players and those who have not had much time on the field. The idea would be to evaluate the whole roster because some kind of overhaul would seem in order during the off-season.         Coughlin conceded that a couple of players who had been inactive might be given an opportunity in the next three weeks. But Coughlin is also old school. The 5-8 Giants can still avoid a losing season something Coughlin has had only five times in a 19-year career as an N.F.L. head coach.         åÛåÏThe guys that deserve to play are going to playåÛå Coughlin said. åÛåÏWeåÛåªre going to try to win football games. WeåÛåªre not going to change any of our objectives or goals.åÛå         Asked to appraise the season and explain what went wrong Coughlin declined.         åÛåÏYou obviously go as hard as you can each week and then you assess the season when the season is overåÛå he said.         The motivation in the final three games Coughlin said is not much different from what it has been since Dallas all but dashed the GiantsåÛåª playoff hopes.         åÛåÏWe can gain and earn some of the respect back with the way we play these three gamesåÛå Coughlin said.         Coughlin may not have called the final three games an audition for next season but defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka said that need not be stated.         åÛåÏWeåÛåªre always constantly being evaluated; thereåÛåªs a huge turnover every yearåÛå Kiwanuka said. åÛåÏSo we always feel if weåÛåªre playing for our careers and for our jobs. That isnåÛåªt going to change but when it comes down to it this is one of the toughest seasons we have had.åÛå         Because the next game brings such a formidable opponent to MetLife Stadium Kiwanuka said he sensed that the Giants could be inspired.         åÛåÏIt helps us as a team because we get an opportunity to go out there and play against the best and to kind of redeem ourselves a little bitåÛå he said.         But Cruz said he remained ambivalent.         åÛåÏI donåÛåªt know if we necessarily want to call ourselves a spoiler team or be in a spoiler roleåÛå Cruz said. åÛåÏBut we just want to go out there and put our best foot forward and win the football game.åÛå         That would reverse the most disturbing trend for the Giants: They have lost 13 of their last 21 games and are 14-15 since winning Super Bowl XLVI.

She defeated Republican Frank Addivinola Independent James Aulenti and James Hall of the Justice Peace Security party in an election to succeed Markey who in June was elected to fill the Senate seat that became vacant when John Kerry was named secretary of state.         Turnout was light for the off-cycle election which came on a day the Boston area was hit by an inch of snow.         Addivinola a lawyer had sought to tie Clark to President Barack Obama's  healthcare reform  law at a time the program has been plagued by technical problems.         The district leans heavily Democratic said Peter Ubertaccio a professor of political science at Stonehill College in Easton Massachusetts.

In the last few months her social media feeds have featured the following photos: a squirrel corpse that looks like itåÛåªs pointing at the car that hit it a constellation of pins on a map marking homicide locations in New York City and a tiny pale pink crustacean she found in Manhattan tap water. The latter was something she found on a slide under her microscope: Dr. Ko is a fourth-year pathology resident at Mount Sinai Hospital.         Where some see dead and ailing body parts she sees prostate glands in the shape of hearts or gallbladder stones that look like diamonds.         åÛåÏSheåÛåªs a visual artist specializing in medicineåÛå said her mother Fon-chiu Mia Chen. Dr. Ko had started out pre-med at the University of California Los Angeles but then decided to study art instead.         åÛåÏShe loves pretty much anything youåÛåªd find at the MÌÄå_tter Museum in Philadelphia: weird fetuses or syphilitic headsåÛå said Thomas Suberman her best friend from her days at Columbia where she enrolled when she decided she wanted to go back into medicine.         Dr. Ko 34 who grew up in Ramona Calif. was the first child of Mia Chen and Jumin Ko Chinese immigrants from Taiwan. Dr. Ko was a model student and obedient daughter but her friends found she often had to sugarcoat things for her parents who insisted on good grades and who forbade sleepovers.         The Kos were not O.K. with her listening to punk music among other things beginning in fifth grade. åÛåÏIt was just so unfamiliar to themåÛå Dr. Ko said. A serious conversation took place when they heard the words åÛåÏcop killeråÛå in an Ice-T song she played. But she became adept at navigating the parental system; in high school wanting a reason to be allowed to go to concerts she joined the school newspaper as a music critic. Soon her mother was chauffeuring her to punk shows at clubs around San Diego.         As a freshman at U.C.L.A. in 1998 she had more leeway to see live music without her parentsåÛåª approval. On a weekend road trip with a classmate to hear bands in Vancouver British Columbia she struck up a conversation with a skinny bleached blond rocker in the audience Tom Thacker.         Mr. Thacker was (and still is) the lead guitarist for Gob a punk band from British Columbia. As a child he too had walked a narrow path but mostly by choice. He was concerned about fairness not wanting a cookie unless his two brothers could also have cookies. His mother recalled how when her son was 6 his teacher said he only could only bring two things into the classroom and he worried heåÛåªd be breaking the rules if he brought a lunch box and a pair of ice skates. WouldnåÛåªt that be three things?         åÛåÏWe thought heåÛåªd do something conventionalåÛå said his mother Ann Thacker of her and his father Bernie Thacker. åÛåÏWe wanted him to be a dentist.åÛå         åÛåÏBut instead I started locking myself in my room with my guitaråÛå said Tom Thacker now 40. Punk rock was his preferred genre. åÛåÏBeing in the suburbs itåÛåªs a kind of music that just makes so much senseåÛå he said. After high school he passed on college and instead worked in a record store while building his guitar skills. When he was 21 he and a friend started Gob. Their music video åÛåÏSodaåÛå went the åÛåª90s version of viral playing daily on MuchMusic a Canadian TV channel. In it he and his band mates ride bikes off a ramp into a lake. He has a bleached mohawk and sings/yells into the camera åÛåÏItåÛåªs so cool that weåÛåªre together and weåÛåªre smiling drinking soda.åÛå         At the time of their meeting Dr. Ko was 18 and not yet very used to men or alcohol. She had lied about her age to get into the club and she said åÛåÏI was drunk.åÛå Not sure what to say to the cute punk rocker she blurted that she was in the honors program at U.C.L.A.         åÛåÏIt wasnåÛåªt what you expect to hear from a girl in a baråÛå he recalled. She gave him her number and told him to call if his tour bus took him to Southern California.

On Saturday Mayor Wayne Smith of Irvington N.J. will announce that his mostly working-class city is proceeding with a legal study of the plan. Irvington could try to head off legal action and repercussions through what are called åÛåÏfriendly condemnationsåÛå in which incentives are used to persuade the owner to drop any objections he said. åÛåÏWe figure if this program works it can help anywhere from 500 to 1000 homes.åÛå         This summer the similarly working-class city of Richmond Calif. in a heavily industrial part of the San Francisco Bay Area  became the first  to identify homes worth far less than their owners owe and offer to buy not the houses themselves but the mortgages. The city intends to reduce the debt on those mortgages saying that will prevent foreclosure blight and falling property values. If the owners of the mortgages åÛåÓ mostly banks and investors åÛåÓ balk the letters said the city could use eminent domain to condemn and buy them.         Since then intense pressure from Wall Street and real estate interests including warnings that mortgages will become difficult or impossible for Richmond residents to get has whittled away support for the plan. The city has yet to actually use its power of eminent domain but it is already fighting two lawsuits filed in federal courts.         Still cities hard hit by the housing crash are showing interest. Yonkers just north of New York City will soon take up a resolution to study the use of eminent domain to reduce debt and support is building in Newark as well. In California  Pomona  and  Oakland  are considering it as well. .         åÛåÏThings seem to be picking up steam in Minnesota and IåÛåªve just been contacted in the past couple of weeks by two cities in Pennsylvania as wellåÛå said Robert Hockett a Cornell University law professor and one of the architects of the strategy. Nationally housing prices have begun to recover but about one in five homeowners still owes more than the home is worth and in cities like Richmond as many as half do.         Several local governments that have considered the plan eventually backed away including San Bernardino County and North Las Vegas. But Mr. Hockett said åÛåÏWeåÛåªre moving into a kind of second generation of municipal interest that is more hard core åÛåÓ itåÛåªs interest with a spine so to speak.åÛå         The cities are all still in the early stages of considering the plan.         In New Jersey the American Civil Liberties Union has also joined the effort saying that opponents are using threats to keep cities from exercising their legal right to employ eminent domain.         Opponents of the strategy including the institutional investors BlackRock and Pimco Wells Fargo and the Mortgage Bankers Association say that taking mortgages by eminent domain is a breach of individual rights and that investors will not receive fair market value for the mortgages. In Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin has asked investors to come to the table to work out a price but they have so far declined to negotiate.         The Federal Housing Finance Agency which oversees the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and controls most mortgages in the country has said that the eminent domain strategy is åÛåÏa clear threat to the safe and sound operations of Fannie Mae Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan BanksåÛå and that it may take legal action against cities that use it or limit mortgage activity there. In Congress a housing finance bill by Jeb Hensarling a Texas Republican and chairman of the Committee on Financial Services would effectively end mortgage financing in cities that used eminent domain.         On Friday letters signed by 10 Democratic members of Congress were expected to be sent to Edward J. DeMarco the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and Shaun Donovan secretary of housing and urban development saying that any policies that restrict mortgage lending in areas that use eminent domain would violate anti-discrimination laws.         åÛåÏWe write to express our disappointment that the Federal Housing Finance Agency is actively supporting and threatening legal action against communities which consider exercising their legal rights to use eminent domain to help struggling homeownersåÛå the letter to Mr. DeMarco said.

School shutdowns and deteriorating results have taken the shine off an education model admired and emulated around the world in Britain in particular.         ""I think we have had too much blind faith in that more private schools would guarantee greater educational quality"" said Tomas TobÌÄå© head of the parliament's education committee and spokesman on education for the ruling Moderate party.         In a country with the fastest growing economic inequality of any OECD nation basic aspects of the deregulated school market are now being re-considered raising questions over private sector involvement in other areas like health.         Two-decades into its free-market experiment about a quarter of once staunchly Socialist Sweden's secondary school students now attend publically-funded but privately run schools almost twice the global average.         Nearly half of those study at schools fully or partly owned by private equity firms.         Ahead of elections next year politicians of all stripes are questioning the role of such firms accused of putting profits first with practices like letting students decide when they have learned enough and keeping no record of their grades.         The opposition Green Party - like the Moderates long-time supporters of privately run schools but now backing the clamp-down - issued a public apology in a Swedish daily last month headlined ""Forgive us our policy led our schools astray"".         CAUTIONARY TALE         In the early 1990's parents were given tax-funded vouchers to pay for a school of their choice. Private schools were allowed for the first time and could even turn a profit.         Britain has taken on board many feature of the system although it has stopped short of allowing publically-funded schools to make a profit and Swedish school corporations have expanded as far afield as India.         This year's demise of JB Education owned by Danish private equity firm Axcel was the biggest but not the only bankruptcy in Sweden's reformed education sector.         It stripped almost 1000 staff of their jobs and left more than 1 billion crowns ($150 million) of debts mainly to banks and suppliers as well as abandoning its students.         ""I was furious"" said Margarete Grugel 56 whose 16-year-old daughter Tina had one week left of her first term of a hair styling course at the JB school in Jonkoping when it folded.         ""Tina was absolutely shattered by it.""         Axcel acknowledges mistakes were made.         ""Of course we could have been better at managing the schools"" senior communication advisor Joachim Sperling said.         ""Many of the schools were in bad shape and even though we knew that from the start we did not manage to deal with the challenges in due time.""         It is a cautionary tale in a market estimated to have been worth more than $400 billion worldwide in a 2010 report by the International Finance Corporation.         With annual turnover in Sweden of roughly 20 billion crowns ($3 billion) according to a recent parliamentary study education should be an attractive prospect.         But while some of the early players sold quickly at a profit nowadays it is no cash cow.         One in four secondary schools is lossmaking and since 2008 the risk of insolvency has shot up 188 percent and is 25 percent above the average for Swedish corporations said UC a business and credit information firm.         ""Few sectors can show as bad figures as this"" it said.         Part of the problem stems from demographics with overall secondary school numbers in sharp decline since 2008 and unlikely to recover to the past peak for a generation or more.         A lax regulatory environment is also to blame.         Sweden replaced one of the world's most tightly regulated school systems with one of the most deregulated leading to scandals like the 2011 case of the convicted paedophile who set up several schools quite legally.         ""I've often said it's been easier to start an independent school than set up a hot-dog stand"" said Eva-Lis Siren head of Lararforbundet Sweden's biggest teachers union.         ""In the push toward freedom of choice one lost sight of quality control.""         CORPORATE WORLD         The private schools brought in many practices once found exclusively in the corporate world such as performance-based bonuses for staff and advertising in Stockholm's subway system while competition has put teachers under pressure to award higher grades and market their schools.         The idea that private equity firms and large corporations would run hundreds of schools was a far cry from the individual locally-run schools envisaged at the start.         ""This was something that was not ... even considered in one's wildest dreams"" said Staffan Lundh who handled school issues in the prime minister's office at the time and now leads evaluation at the National Agency for Education (NAE).         While it is difficult to say how or even whether private involvement and falling standards are linked the NAE says there are indications the market-driven reforms have contributed to widen the gaps in school performances.         The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) benchmark Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study paints a bleak picture with Sweden now ranking below Russia in maths.

(One idea: åÛåÏGive it out at beauty salons.åÛå)         The emailåÛåªs subject line was telling: åÛåÏThis is the word of Chirlane.åÛå         Publicly Mr. de Blasio remains vague about the kind of role Ms. McCray a 59-year-old poet and writer will occupy in his administration. But dozens of conversations with aides a review of previously undisclosed emails and an interview with the couple suggest there is little precedent in New York for the intense day-to-day political partnership that the mayor-elect and his wife intend to bring to City Hall on Jan. 1.         Together the pair map out political strategy court endorsements deliberate policy recruit staff and write speeches insisting on a degree of equality and collaboration that is rarely found between elected officials and their spouses.         Mr. de Blasio in the interview on Tuesday compared Ms. McCrayåÛåªs place in his coming administration to that of åÛåÏwell-known senior advisers down through historyåÛå and the couple acknowledged the possibility that she might have an office in City Hall or play an important role in an area of city policy.         åÛåÏShe is the most important adviser I haveåÛå Mr. de Blasio said. He called their approach to politics a åÛåÏpartnership modelåÛå adding åÛåÏIt has served us very well.åÛå         Mr. de Blasio has given Ms. McCray an influential place in the process of assembling his administration. She sat next to her husband at the first meeting of the 60-member transition committee and has joined him for sit-down conversations with potential appointees. (A few nights ago she and her husband dined with William J. Bratton whom Mr. de Blasio is considering as the next police commissioner.)         His wifeåÛåªs approval or disapproval of a job candidate Mr. de Blasio said weighs heavily on his hiring decisions.         åÛåÏWhen she raises red flagsåÛå Mr. de Blasio said åÛåÏI take them very seriously.åÛå         From the very onset of Mr. de BlasioåÛåªs political career in the 1990s Ms. McCray has put herself at the center of crucial discussions åÛåÓ which is exactly where Mr. de Blasio wants her.         She became a fixture at retreats for his staff where her words carried special significance: Aides recalled her exhortations that his legacy be distinctive and that his åÛåÏfuture is limitless.åÛå         She participated in late-night conference calls with Mr. de BlasioåÛåªs advisers peppering his pollster with questions about the data.         And she urged Mr. de Blasio a Democrat to support politically fraught measures like the ban on smoking in restaurants persuading him to look past his fears of a backlash.         Pressed in the interview on how she lobbies her husband Ms. McCray replied åÛåÏI use whatever means necessary.åÛå She added wryly åÛåÏI have been known to badger.åÛå         Mr. de Blasio said he trusted his wifeåÛåªs instincts implicitly. Not just as a spouse who knows him intimately but as a deft political mind in her own right: a feminist activist who understands grass-roots organizing a liberal champion of the working class and an experienced author who has written speeches for leading New York officials.         She is Mr. de Blasio said åÛåÏmost often the person who is right.åÛå         For those who go to work for Mr. de Blasio the coupleåÛåªs arrangement can require an adjustment.

Speaking before a government-appointed panel looking into the future of Australia's beleaguered car industry Mike Devereux head of GM's Holden unit also said GM would need more assistance from the Australian government to survive long term.         ""We need a public-private partnership over the long term to be relatively competitive"" he said in closely watched comments amid debate that GM could follow other automakers in pulling the plug on Australian manufacturing.         The auto industry in Australia has depended on government support for years due to soaring costs a strong Australian dollar cheap imports and weak exports.         Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp exited in 2008 and Ford Motor Co announced in May it would close its two Australian auto plants in October 2016.         There are widespread concerns that any exit by GM Holden will be followed by Toyota Motor Co causing a collapse of the entire domestic industry supporting more than 40000 workers and 150 supplier companies.         Acting Prime Minister Warren Truss criticised the lack of commitment from Holden.         ""Your comments merely confirmed that a decision to end manufacturing in Australia remains a live option and has not been ruled out"" he said in a letter to Devereux that was released to the media.         ""It is the Australian government's view that GM Holden must immediately provide a clear explanation of its future intentions and explain what its plans are for its Australian manufacturing operations.""         Truss said the Federal government had provided more than A$1 billion in support to the industry in recent years and had committed to a further A$1 billion between 2015-2020. It has ruled out increasing subsidies.         Truss is acting prime minister while Tony Abbott is visiting South Africa to attend the memorial for Nelson Mandela.         Devereux said it cost $3750 more to build a car in Australia than at GM's other plants in Asia and that gap would have to shrink with the help of government assistance and further cost-cutting in order to keep the operations open.         He praised the U.S. government's decision to bail out car makers during the global financial crisis saying that had spurred the industry's resurgence and said as the No.2 car brand in Australia Holden wanted to continue making cars here.         ""The budgetary cost of losing this industry would dwarf the cost of keeping it"" he said.         Devereux declined to say how much assistance the company had sought from the government but the Labour opposition's industry spokesman Kim Carr has said Holden would keep its plants open if it received A$150 million ($136 million) a year.         Even with government support Devereux said Holden would look to cut the local components used in its flagship Commodore cars beyond 2016 to around 25 to 30 percent from 50 percent of the vehicle currently.         Holden which claims a 10 percent share of the Australian market posted a A$153 million loss in 2012. It employs nearly 4000 people.

Lawmakers and the employees who work in their åÛåÏofficial officesåÛå will receive coverage next year through the small-business marketplace of the local insurance exchange known as D.C. Health Link which has staff members close at hand for guidance.         åÛåÏD.C. Health Link set up shop right here in CongressåÛå said Eleanor Holmes Norton the delegate to the House from the nationåÛåªs capital.         Insurers routinely offer åÛåÏmember servicesåÛå to enrollees. But on Capitol Hill the phrase has special meaning indicating concierge-type services for members of Congress.         If lawmakers have questions about Aetna plan benefits and provider networks they can call a special phone number that provides åÛåÏmember services for members of Congress and staff.åÛå         On the website run by the Obama administration for 36 states it is notoriously difficult to see the prices deductibles and other details of health plans.         It is much easier for members of Congress and their aides to see and compare their options on websites run by the Senate the House and the local exchange.         Lawmakers can select from 112 options offered in the åÛåÏgold tieråÛå of the District of Columbia exchange far more than are available to most of their constituents.         Aetna is offering eight plan options to members of Congress and Blue Cross and Blue Shield is offering 16. Eight are available from Kaiser Permanente and 80 are on sale from the UnitedHealth Group.         Lawmakers and their aides are not eligible for tax credit subsidies but the government pays up to 75 percent of their premiums contributing a maximum of $5114 a year for individual coverage and $11378 for family coverage. The government contribution is based on the same formula used for most other federal employees.         In debates leading up to passage of the Affordable Care Act members of both parties suggested that all Americans should have coverage as good as what Congress had. President Obama said in 2009 that people should be able to buy insurance in a marketplace or exchange åÛåÏthe same way that federal employees do same way that members of Congress do.åÛå         For decades members of Congress have received coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. They generally like their coverage but åÛåÓ like millions of Americans facing the loss of their policies next year åÛåÓ they cannot keep it.         In the past if lawmakers did nothing in the open enrollment period their coverage would automatically continue. This year by contrast they must affirmatively pick a plan. Their coverage under the federal employee program will end on Dec. 31. If they do not choose a plan via D.C. Health Link by Dec. 9 they will lose the government contribution to their premiums and could lose their right to retiree health benefits as well.         In addition lawmakers who go without insurance next year may like other Americans be subject to tax penalties.

It is poised between inward-looking old powers and reluctant emergent ones. The post-9/11 era is over; it has bequeathed an exhausted America.         Morbid symptoms include a dysfunctional United Nations Security Council a Syria that bleeds an American economy squeezing its middle class and a Europe that leaves its youth jobless. But does anyone want the superpoweråÛåªs mantle?         According to a survey this year by the Pew Research Center 83 percent of Americans think the president should concentrate on domestic policy against 6 percent who believe his priority should be foreign affairs. That is the lowest recorded number for foreign policy concerns since PewåÛåªs survey on national priorities began 15 years ago. In 2007 39 percent thought the presidentåÛåªs primary focus should be domestic as compared with 40 percent for foreign.         This is the national mood behind the withdrawal from Iraq the looming pullback from Afghanistan the last-minute retreat from military strikes against Syria and a possibly imminent (and highly desirable) interim deal with Iran on its nuclear program. If there is a single phrase America has taken to heart it comes from Robert Gates the former defense secretary: åÛåÏAny future defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should åÛå÷have his head examinedåÛåª as General MacArthur so delicately put it.åÛå         The immense toll in lives and treasure of Iraq and Afghanistan åÛåÓ wars the country will try to forget rather than memorialize åÛåÓ explains part of the inward turn. So too does a feeling that something is skewed in an economy where for many the relationship between hard work and reward seems lost. But there is something more a very American pragmatism that has understood the power shift now underway and wants the nation to husband its resources after a reckless decade.         When an exhausted Britain in imperial decline passed the mantle of global power to the United States the transition was relatively seamless an affair between cousins. Today AmericaåÛåªs travails inspire schadenfreude but nobody much wants the keys to the kingdom.         Never have the ambitions of the European Union been so circumscribed. Consumed with internal problems particularly those of the euro it has lost coherence. Europe for the foreseeable future will spend more time debating its internal architecture than defining its external objectives.         The French-German alliance the motor of integration is frayed to the point of near rupture. Germany needs France less and has shed many of its complexes but history and self-absorption mean it will punch below its weight doing enough to avert European implosion but not enough to give Europe renewed impulsion. AmericaåÛåªs inward turn finds Europe introverted unable to take a leadership role on any crisis but its own.         Russia under Vladimir Putin is a spoiling power above all still driven by the notion that as he once put it the Soviet UnionåÛåªs collapse was åÛåÏthe greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.åÛå Its ambitions lie in turning back the clock.         China the heir apparent to nobodyåÛåªs world has scarcely a word to say on Syria less still on Iran. Stability is its watchword with an eye on full development by midcentury. It still needs America as an offsetting power in Asia. It is heavily invested in the avoidance of any American economic debacle. Peaceful rise means cautious rise. Neither China nor India shows much interest for now in new organizing principles for the world.         Perhaps those principles are now defined by technology social networks and individual empowerment forces that lie outside conventional notions of geostrategic power. But this is just another way of saying that the worldåÛåªs current interregnum is little understood.         It is just over a decade since President George W. Bush lumped North Korea Iraq and Iran together in an åÛåÏaxis of evilåÛå an unhappy phrase pregnant with disastrous consequences. The United States has since learned many bitter lessons.         The importance of the now likely deal with Iran and of the conversations taking place between Tehran and Washington on a range of subjects goes well beyond the nuclear dossier. The Iranian revolution was an uprising against Western dominance (just as the nuclear program is above all an assertion of technological independence). For more than three decades antagonism has prevailed. If the United States and Iran can reach some accommodation it would be the most powerful signal in a long time of an American willingness to rethink its global strategy in the most volatile area of the world.         Interregnums are dangerous åÛåÓ and doubly morbid if unaccompanied by a readiness to think anew about changed power structures.

But thatåÛåªs what happened to me last week when I attended the 2013 John Dewey lectures given by Noam Chomsky under the auspices of the Columbia University philosophy department.         The views I have been peddling to various audiences (without notable success) are: (1) The academy is a world of its own complete with rules protocols systems of evaluation recognized achievements agreed-on goals a roster of heroes and a list of tasks yet to be done. (2) Academic work proceeds within the confines of that world within that is a professional not a public space although its performance may be and often is public. Accordingly (3) academic work is only tangentially not essentially political; politics may attend the formation of academic units and the selection of academic personnel but political concerns and pressures have no place in the unfolding of academic argument except as objects of its distinctive forms of attention. (If academic work had no distinctive forms of attention it would be shapeless and would not be a thing.) (4) The academic views of a professor are independent of his or her real-world political views; academic disputes donåÛåªt track partisan disputes or vice versa; you canåÛåªt reason from an academicåÛåªs disciplinary views to the positions he or she would take in the public sphere; they are independent variables.         Now as everyone knows Noam Chomsky is a distinguished academic a scholar who pretty much single-handedly reconfigured the discipline of linguistics and a strong presence in the landscape of other disciplines åÛåÓ philosophy of mind psychology biology literary criticism to name a few. But Chomsky is also a prominent public intellectual whose opinions on a wide range of political topics åÛåÓ American foreign policy the Middle East capitalism fossil fuels education etc. åÛåÓ are well known and often controversial. So the question was which Chomsky was going to show up at Columbia or alternatively could you have one without the other? The answer it turned out is åÛåÏyes.åÛå         Chomsky gave three lectures under the general title åÛåÏWhat Kind of Creatures are We?åÛå The answer given in the first lecture åÛåÓ åÛåÏWhat is Language?åÛå åÛåÓ is that we are creatures with language and that language as a uniquely human biological capacity appeared suddenly and quite late in the evolutionary story perhaps 75000 years ago. Language then does not arise from the social/cultural environment although the environment provides the stuff or input it works on. That input is åÛåÏimpoverishedåÛå; it canåÛåªt account for the creativity of language performance which has its source not in the empirical world but in an innate ability that is more powerful than the stimuli it utilizes and plays with. It follows that if you want to understand language you shouldnåÛåªt look to linguistic behavior but to the internal mechanism åÛåÓ the Universal Grammar åÛåÓ of which particular linguistic behaviors are a non-exhaustive expression. (The capacity exceeds the empirical resources it might deploy.)         In his second lecture (åÛåÏWhat Can We Understand?åÛå) Chomsky took up the question of what humans are capable of understanding and his answer generally was that we can understand what we can understand and that means that we canåÛåªt understand what is beyond our innate mental capacities. This does not mean he said that what we canåÛåªt understand is not real: åÛåÏWhat is mysterious to me is not an argument that it does not exist.åÛå ItåÛåªs just that while language is powerful and creative its power and creativity have limits; and since language  is  thought rather than an addition to or clothing of thought the limits of language are the limits of what we can fruitfully think about. Nor Chomsky declared are those limits capable of being enlarged or transcended in time. This is as good as it gets. There is åÛåÏno evolution in our capacity for language.åÛå These assertions are offered as a counter to what Chomsky sees as the over-optimistic Enlightenment belief åÛåÓ common to many empiricist philosophies åÛåÓ that ours is a åÛåÏlimitless explanatory poweråÛå and that åÛåÏwe can do anything.åÛå Our limits he concluded should not be lamented for the fact of limits enables perception and predication åÛåÏIf there were no limitsåÛå everything would be mush and åÛåÏthere would be no scopeåÛå for definite action. (Here we might think of WordsworthåÛåªs great sonnet åÛåÏNuns fret not at their conventåÛåªs narrow room.åÛå)

ThatåÛåªs actually not the worst news in a new round of polling. The worst news åÛåÓ or what the White House should find most worrisome åÛåÓ is that the presidentåÛåªs character has taken a hit.         For most of the Obama presidency the majority of Americans have viewed many of his character traits positively even if they didnåÛåªt agree with his politics.         They may have disapproved of his vision for the country and his ability to manage it but they often simultaneously said that they thought him honest and trustworthy and a strong and decisive leader.         It was a way for some of his most vociferous detractors to say: ItåÛåªs not personal; itåÛåªs political. ItåÛåªs the Washington version of damning with faint praise.         Now even that is being diminished. The sloppy rollout of the HealthCare.gov website and the presidentåÛåªs having promised something åÛåÓ åÛåÏyou can keep itåÛå åÛåÓ that turned out not to be true for some is giving license to more Americans to dispense with their character defenses.         According to  a Gallup report  released Wednesday the percentage of people judging the president as honest and trustworthy had been around 60 percent for most of his time in office. Now that number stands at 50 percent.         The  results  of a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday were even more troubling. It found: åÛåÏFor the first time today American voters say 52 - 44 percent that Obama is not honest and trustworthy.åÛå         The sad part here is that there is merit to peopleåÛåªs dissatisfaction.         The administration has left itself open on the health care law and its opponents are attacking at every opportunity. At its most noble politics is the exercise of a government in the interest of people. But at its most practical åÛåÓ and petty åÛåÓ itåÛåªs a blood sport.         This is a moment in our politics when the latter dominates.         The White House is now feeling the consequences of floundering a failure and a fallacy.         These are made-for-media story lines: the mighty tech-savvy Obama-bots brought to heel by a tech snafu and the well-spoken president being undone by a åÛåÏmisspokenåÛå promise. A comeuppance for the too-cool commander in chief.         In politics åÛåÓ and pop culture åÛåÓ the news media likes stories that follow a well-worn trajectory: rise fall and resurrection. Some see this as a fall åÛåÓ or possibly  the  fall åÛåÓ moment for the Obama administration. And even if itåÛåªs not they will treat it as such for page views and cable ratings.         This is not to say that the administration canåÛåªt recover. It can. In fact in all likelihood it will. And when it does that too will be deemed news åÛåÓ the resurrection. But in this moment the administration must take some lumps as it attempts to limp out of this mess correct its problems and regain its footing.         That wonåÛåªt be easy. Now Democrats åÛåÓ some nervous some simply needling åÛåÓ are lining up with the Republicans to demand changes to the health care law.         In an interview published this week former President Clinton said: åÛåÏI personally believe even if it takes a change in the law the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to these people and let them keep what they got.åÛå         Obama had already signaled that he was open to changes to the law without specifying which ones. But ClintonåÛåªs comment went further specifying a change without acknowledging the difficulty of making such a change now that many of the cancellations have already gone out.         ClintonåÛåªs comments have given cover for other Democrats who want to avoid being associated with the Health Care Problem.         Friends to the end (of fair weather).         I have no doubt that the website will eventually be fixed. The only question is whether it will be fixed by the end of November as the administration has aimed for. A  report  this week in The Washington Post said:         åÛåÏSoftware problems with the federal online health insurance marketplace especially in handling high volumes are proving so stubborn that the system is unlikely to work fully by the end of the month as the White House has promised according to an official with knowledge of the project.åÛå         Exceeding that date would blow yet another hole in peopleåÛåªs confidence that the administration has a handle on the problem and is capable of fixing it. And that crisis of confidence is what is hurting the president at this moment.         Winston Churchill is credited with saying: åÛåÏSuccess is not final failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.åÛå         But in politics the confidence of the public also counts. The White House canåÛåªt afford to lose more of it.

Conducted by two accounting professors at Tilburg University in The Netherlands the study reinforces long-held perceptions of a clubby culture on U.S. corporate boards where members seldom challenge the executives they are meant to police.         The study looked at about 2000 U.S. companies and their board audit committees which are responsible for overseeing outside auditors and making sure financial reports are accurate. It found that personal friends of senior managers were often appointed to these committees making the directors more likely to go along with the company's reporting practices.         Where that was the case earnings manipulation was more frequent and problems such as weak financial controls were covered up the study found.         Regulations put in place over a decade ago after accounting scandals at Enron and WorldCom required audit committees to be made up only of independent directors. That meant they were never employed by the company or a firm doing business with it.         Even so audit committee members often have long-standing social ties to executives belonging to the same elite clubs or charity boards the study found.         ""Although such firms appear to have independent audit committees in reality these committees offer little to no monitoring at all"" the study found.         The study by accounting professors Liesbeth Bruynseels and Eddy Cardinaels researched social ties with BoardEx a business intelligence service. It appears in the January 2014 issue of the American Accounting Association's Accounting Review.         The professors suggested that legislators consider requiring more disclosure about social connections between audit committees and CEOs given the committees' importance.         Charles Elson director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance in Newark Delaware said it would be difficult for regulators to define social ties.         ""Is it one lunch a week is it two lunches? Inevitably social ties will develop when you're on a board - you have to see that person on a regular basis"" he said.         The United States made a major push to improve audit committees' effectiveness with the passage of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act which tightened membership requirements.         More recently regulators in Europe and the United Kingdom have been trying to get audit committees to be more rigorous in choosing outside auditors and monitoring them.

As with most single parents åÛåÓ and indeed with most parents åÛåÓ it hasnåÛåªt always been easy.         People sometimes say that parenting is the toughest job youåÛåªll ever love. But I believe that parenting is sometimes so tough åÛåÓ and exhausting åÛåÓ that you donåÛåªt always remember to slow down enough to love it. Sometimes the love is registered in retrospect.         We jockey to give our children the best without giving them so much that they canåÛåªt appreciate what they have. We try to encourage them without coddling them. We lavish gifts upon them while simultaneously trying to nurture grit within them.         Parents walk a thin line between oppositional forces never knowing if we are truly getting it right judging ourselves and being judged by others.         And we are inundated by studies and books and advice: do this or that if you want your child to succeed and not spend his or her 20s on your sofa.         I try to tune most of it out. When I feel overwhelmed I call my mother. She always seems to know what to say. I guess thatåÛåªs why they call it åÛåÏmotheråÛåªs wit.åÛå         When my three children were younger and the strain of taking care of them seemed as though it would overwhelm me my mother would tell me what an elderly babysitter once told her when she too felt overwhelmed: åÛåÏBaby one day theyåÛåªll be able to get themselves a cup of water.åÛå         It was a simple way of saying that children grow up and become more self-reliant and eventually they set out on their own to chart their own course. You wonåÛåªt always have to wait on them hand and foot.         She told me to remember that the more people a child has who truly loves him or her the happier that child will be. So I work hard to maintain and expand their circles of love.         She taught me that parenting was a lot like giving a hug: ItåÛåªs all about love and pressure and there is no one way to do it.         She taught me that sometimes you have to make time for yourself so that you will have energy to give to your children. Allow them to have a pizza night every now and then. An occasional treat wonåÛåªt hurt them but working yourself to a frazzle will surely hurt you. Rest.         She taught me that you must allow yourself time to find stillness and so you can be moved by it. Sometimes we are so busy that we forget why weåÛåªre busy. We have so many things on our list of priorities that we lose sight of whatåÛåªs really important.         And she taught me that my children are not truly mine. They donåÛåªt belong to me; theyåÛåªve simply been entrusted to me. They are a gift life gave to me but one that I must one day give back to life. They must grow up and go away and that is as it should be.         But as the time with my children in my home draws to a close åÛåÓ my oldest is away at college and my twins are 16-year-old high school juniors åÛåÓ IåÛåªm beginning to feel the pains in my chest that all parents feel when their children move away.         I thought that this would be a celebratory time a time when I would relish the idea of getting back to me of working late without worry and taking last-minute weekend jaunts.         But I donåÛåªt. Letting go is hard for me to do. I must let go but my heart feels hollow. I canåÛåªt imagine me without them.         Lately there are times that I find myself just staring at my children that kind of look that says åÛåÏI see you really see you and I love you with an all-consuming love the kind of love that envelops you and sustains me.åÛå ItåÛåªs the kind of look that invariably draws from my children a åÛåÏWhat? What are you looking at?åÛå They speak the words through the slightest smile a barely registered one the kind of smile a teenager manages when they know that they are loved but feel that they are too old for hugs or tears.         Life gave them to me. IåÛåªm preparing myself as best I can to give them back to life.

A somewhat revamped version of the show is being planned for Las Vegas in 2015 according to the producer Jeremiah J. Harris.         The decision to close åÛåÏSpider-ManåÛå which gained worldwide publicity and  notoriety  because of cast injuries and backstage conflicts as well as its enormous budget came down to a hard financial reality after three years of performances Mr. Harris said. While the musical emerged to become an audience favorite grossing roughly $1.5 million a week in ticket sales for a time åÛåÏSpider-ManåÛå eventually lost popularity. It grossed only $742595 last week or 48 percent of the maximum possible amount with about three-quarters of its seats filled at the Foxwoods Theater.         åÛåÏThe show is I would say middlingåÛå Mr. Harris said of box office sales. åÛåÏWe could run for probably another three to five years being stuck in the middle. We think it will play Las Vegas with a greater bang than it did in New York.åÛå The producers are now in final negotiations for a space in Las Vegas which Mr. Harris declined to identify.         Mr. Harris said the owners of the Foxwoods Theater did not invoke their stop clause with which theater owners can force a show to close when its weekly grosses fall below a certain amount. åÛåÏThe decision to close was all oursåÛå he said. The owners of the Foxwoods who are based in London could not be immediately reached for comment.         The decision to close the show was reported Monday night by  The Wall Street Journal .         The new Australian musical  åÛåÏKing KongåÛå  has been considering a move to the Foxwoods after åÛåÏSpider-ManåÛå closes but no official plans are in place. The Foxwoods is expected to undergo some renovations before its next tenant moves in.         While åÛåÏSpider-ManåÛå has grossed $203 million since performances began in November 2010 the musical is still a long way from paying back investors who contributed to the $75 million capitalization. Mr. Harris said he did not know how close åÛåÏSpider-ManåÛå was to recouping the money. But ticket sales sometimes barely covered the showåÛåªs weekly running costs which exceeded $1 million so there was relatively little profit to share with investors. Some loans also had to be paid back first.         As for Las Vegas Mr. Harris said the creative team would be made up of key players from the Broadway production including Philip William McKinley who took over directing duties on the musical after the producers fired its original leader Julie Taymor.         åÛåÏI think the musical will be very similar to New York but obviously sculpted for the Las Vegas marketåÛå Mr. Harris said of åÛåÏSpider-ManåÛå which is best-known for its aerial effects over the audience and its original score by Bono and the Edge of U2.         Mr. Harris said he did not know at this point if the script would change markedly or if Bono and the Edge would write new songs for Las Vegas. Nor did Mr. Harris have a budget estimate for the Las Vegas production but he said that sets costumes and special-effects technology from the Broadway åÛåÏSpider-ManåÛå would be used there. He said he hoped the show would eventually spin off future productions overseas.         The firing of Ms. Taymor in March 2011 after artistic clashes with the producers and Bono and the Edge was one of several highly publicized incidents that seemed to fuel public interest and ticket sales for the show. After officially opening in June 2011 to largely  negative reviews  from critics the show settled into a period of strong ticket sales and relative calm inside the Foxwoods åÛåÓ even as Ms. Taymor and the producers sued one another in court in legal wrangling that was finally  settled in April .         But åÛåÏSpider-ManåÛå received more negative publicity in August after a dancer in the show Daniel Curry was  seriously injured  mid-performance; he is now considering legal action as he continues to recover his lawyers say.

They seldom talk about the night their mother and father two sisters and a brother died when the winds of Typhoon Haiyan shrieked deafeningly and waves taller than nearby coconut palms swept over their home obliterating everything except a toilet bowl attached to a small square of concrete foundation.         Three weeks after the storm killed thousands with its tsunami-like storm surge and shredded homes with some of the most powerful typhoon winds ever recorded this town and many like it across Leyte Island in the east-central Philippines are scenes of grieving. Yet acts of heroism abound and they have been intermingled with only a few acts of malice and madness as when a 12-year-old boyåÛåªs throat was slit when he showed up during a spree of looting here or when a man was chased out of his home by an escaped convict with a gun.         The episodes of heroism reflect a remarkable will to endure among people of all ages here often with a special emphasis on making sure that the children will not only survive but also be able to rebuild the devastated island.         Maria Kaaya a 72-year-old widow who has spent the last few years helping her grandson and his wife raise six children had not eaten for four days when she foraged on a recent afternoon among the stumps and storm-felled trees of a coconut palm forest near her home in Malobago Village in the center of Leyte Island. Carefully walking along one fallen trunk and then the next because that was easier than clambering up and down in the three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle of broken trees she found what she had been looking for: the crown of a coconut palm its sweet succulent core still inside.         Mrs. KaayaåÛåªs big concern was not the hunger gnawing at her own stomach but how to hack open coconut palm crowns without the family machete which was lost in the storm. Each of the three tiny rooms of the family home had been hit by a different falling coconut tree destroying the roof and flattening every exterior cinder block wall yet somehow sparing the family members as they hid screaming under the bed; they have lived under a scavenged tarpaulin ever since.         Studying the palmåÛåªs crown wistfully Mrs. Kaaya said åÛåÏIf only I can find someone who can break it open. He can split it with me.åÛå         As people like Mrs. Kaaya seek to look after loved ones contrasting scenes of ugliness are rare here although not unheard-of. Many seem to involve the roughly 1100 convicts including murderers who escaped from three prisons åÛåÓ all near TaclobanåÛåªs airport åÛåÓ that were destroyed by the typhoon.         Jenny Malaki a resident of one of the many cramped alleys here in Tacloban said that her cousin by marriage had fled to the other end of the island after being chased out of his home by an escaped convict who had obtained a gun and had a grudge against him. åÛåÏThe man almost shot himåÛå she said.         In a separate episode a 12-year-old boy was stabbed in the chest and his throat was slit when he showed up soon after the typhoon at the ransacking of the Robinsons shopping mall near the airport according to the Philippine Red Cross. Members of the crowd rushed the boy to an orphanage where the staff had medical training and his life was saved.         Mr. Pascual who is 18 said that he had participated in the plundering of a warehouse two days after the typhoon to obtain food for his younger brothers and sister but had been careful. He chose the least popular canned food and did not participate in the melee for more popular items he said partly because he could not afford to be injured.         åÛåÏI just got some sardinesåÛå he said. åÛåÏI didnåÛåªt fight for the other canned goods.åÛå

The veteran Merrill E. Newman 85 of Palo Alto Calif. has been detained in North Korea since Oct. 26 when he was taken off a flight as he was about to leave the country. He had been visiting on a tourist visa.         The Korean Central News Agency said on Saturday that Mr. Newman had åÛåÏadmitted his crimesåÛå and apologized for his actions during the war which lasted from 1950 until 1953.         Mr. Newman who is a retired technology executive served as an infantryman during the war and had long wanted to revisit the country.         Mr. NewmanåÛåªs son Jeff Newman had said that the day before his father was to leave North Korea he had a meeting with his tour guide during which the Korean War was discussed.         The news agency said Mr. Newman had åÛåÏmasterminded espionage and subversive activities against the D.P.R.K. and in this course he was involved in killings of service personnel of the Korean PeopleåÛåªs Army and innocent civilians.åÛå The D.P.R.K. stands for the Democratic PeopleåÛåªs Republic of Korea.         KCNA also published what it said was Mr. NewmanåÛåªs apology a statement in often stilted English that described actions during the war. It also  released a video  in which Mr. Newman was seen reading excerpts from the statement.         åÛå÷åÛå÷During the Korean War I have been guilty of a long list of indelible crimes against DPRK government and Korean people as advisor of the Kuwol Unit of the U.N. Korea 6th Partisan Regiment part of the Intelligence Bureau of the Far East CommandåÛåªåÛåª it said.         Relatives had appealed to the North Korean government to release Mr. Newman with Jeff Newman calling the situation a åÛåÏmisunderstanding.åÛå He said his father has a heart condition and a bad back and was on several medications.         Mr. NewmanåÛåªs relatives were not immediately available to comment on his arrest.         The detention of Mr. Newman led the United States to issue a  travel warning  about visiting North Korea saying åÛåÏU.S. citizens crossing into North Korea even accidentally have been subject to arbitrary arrest and long-term detention.åÛå         North Korea continues to hold Kenneth Bae 44 a Christian missionary who was sentenced in May to 15 years of hard labor for committing åÛåÏhostile actsåÛå against the North.  Mr. BaeåÛåªs mother  was recently allowed to visit him in a hospital where he was being treated after becoming ill after working at a labor camp.         Mr. Newman was detained at the end of a nine-day trip he made to North Korea with a companion from his California retirement village. The friend Bob Hamrdla said Mr. NewmanåÛåªs talk with the tour guide the day before his planned departure had not gone well and had left him upset.         His flight was about to take off from Pyongyang to Beijing when he was pulled off the plane.         The State Department had no immediate comment on the North Korean report.

Nokia has offered to pay a 270 million euro ($369 million) deposit to Indian authorities to unfreeze assets in a tax dispute according to sources familiar with the matter.         The Finnish firm has been trying to free up the assets particularly its Chennai factory which is one of its biggest phone-making plants ahead of the sale of its mobile phone business to Microsoft.         The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the tax authorities to submit the value of the Chennai factory on Wednesday when it is due to hear the case again amid growing uncertainty about Nokia's exact tax liabilities in India.         A lawyer for the tax department said on Tuesday Nokia owed 78 billion rupees ($1.28 billion) in tax payments.         The Times of India reported on Tuesday the tax department had informed the Delhi High Court that Nokia owned the authorities more than 210 billion rupees ($3.4 billion) which included penalty for a seven-year period beginning 2006.         The final sum of tax liabilities are not yet known. But in March it was served with a tax demand of about 20.8 billion rupees for five fiscal years starting from 2006/07 according to a March 22 notice on the Delhi High Court website.         Nokia said it had not been served with any claim beyond that 20.8 billion rupee amount.         ""In recent months we have seen and read about many claims from the tax authorities"" the company said in a statement on Tuesday. ""We feel they are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously in court.""         While Nokia has said it does not expect the dispute to affect its 5.4 billion euro deal with Microsoft which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014 a lengthy asset freeze could complicate matters by preventing the transfer of ownership in the Chennai plant.         Nokia has said it wanted the assets to be released by December 12.

No not the universally adored elder statesman who successfully resisted the megalomania that comes with deification and who died Thursday at age 95 but the young lawyer who used to sit in my parentsåÛåª living room until the early hours of the morning debating African nationalism with my father Ashby Peter Mda.         In 1944 they were among the leaders who had founded the African National Congress Youth League. These young men considered the  African National Congress  which had by then existed for more than three decades moribund and outmoded. They felt there was a need to take the liberation struggle from protest to armed struggle and were known to shout down those they felt were åÛåÏselling outåÛå by participating in apartheid-created structures through which black people were supposed to express their political aspirations.         What struck me even then was that Mandela was a man of contradictions. He could be avuncular especially to us kids but he was also strict and disciplined. While he was a fire-breathing revolutionary who would quote Marx and Lenin at the drop of a hat he was also a Xhosa traditionalist with aristocratic tendencies. For instance Kaiser and George Matanzima chiefs of the Tembu ethnic group who spearheaded the apartheid åÛåÏBantustanåÛå system of separate territories for black South Africans were not only his relatives but his friends as well. While many thought the Matanzima brothers had betrayed the cause of black liberation Mandela would not thoroughly denounce them. Perhaps here we could already see the flicker of tolerance to those with opposing views for which he later distinguished himself.         It is ironic that in todayåÛåªs  South Africa  there is an increasingly vocal segment of black South Africans who feel that Mandela sold out the liberation struggle to white interests. This will come as a surprise to the international community which informally canonized him and thinks he enjoyed universal adoration in his country. After he initiated negotiations for the end of apartheid and led South Africa into a new era of freedom with a progressive Constitution that recognizes the rights of everyone (including homosexuals another admirable contradiction for an African aristocrat) there was of course euphoria in the country. But that was a long time ago. With the rampant corruption of the current ruling elite and the fact that very little has changed for a majority of black people the euphoria has been replaced with disillusionment.         The new order that Mandela brought about this argument goes did not fundamentally change the economic arrangements in the country. It ushered in prosperity but the distribution of that prosperity was skewed in favor of the white establishment and its dependent new black elite. Today the political apparatchiks are the new billionaires led by a president åÛåÓ Jacob Zuma åÛåÓ who blatantly used millions of taxpayer dollars to upgrade his private residence to accommodate his expanding harem and a phalanx of children.         The blame-Mandela movement is not by any means a groundswell but it is loud enough in its vehemence to warrant attention. It is led by individual activists whose main platforms are Facebook Twitter and other social media and in its formal sense by such organizations as the  September National Imbizo  which believes that åÛåÏSouth Africa is an anti-black white supremacist country managed by the A.N.C. in the interests of white people. Only blacks can liberate themselves.åÛå The claim is that the settlement reached between the A.N.C. and the white apartheid government was a fraud perpetrated on the black people who have yet to get back the land stolen by whites during colonialism. MandelaåÛåªs government critics say focused on the cosmetics of reconciliation while nothing materially changed in the lives of a majority of South Africans.         This movement though not representative of the majority of black South Africans who still adore Mandela and his A.N.C. is gaining momentum especially on university campuses.         I understand the frustrations of those young South Africans and I share their disillusionment. I however do not share their perspective on Mandela. I saw in him a skillful politician whose policy of reconciliation saved the country from a blood bath and ushered it into a period of democracy human rights and tolerance. I admired him for his compassion and generosity values that are not usually associated with politicians. I also admired him for his integrity and loyalty.         But I fear that for Mandela loyalty went too far. The corruption that we see today did not just suddenly erupt after his term in office; it took root during his time. He was loyal to his comrades to a fault and was therefore blind to some of their misdeeds.         When he was president I often wrote about the emerging patronage system and crony capitalism. To his credit when I wrote him a long letter outlining my concerns he phoned me within a week and arranged a meeting between me and three of his senior cabinet ministers. Although nothing of substance came of the meeting the very fact that Mandela listened attentively to the complaints of an ordinary citizen and took them seriously enough to convene such a meeting was extraordinary for any president.         In later years however Mandela became the victim of the very corruption I was complaining about. He was surrounded by all sorts of characters friends and relatives some of whom were keen to profit from his name. They include his grandson Mandla Mandela a petty tribal chief who was widely reported to have pre-emptively sold to a television network the broadcast rights to his grandfatheråÛåªs funeral.         Mandela leaves a proud legacy of freedom and human rights of tolerance and reconciliation. Alas some of his compatriots are trampling on it. I cannot speak for him and say he was pained by what he saw happening to his country in his last days. I had not spoken with him for years before he died. But I can say that the Mandela I knew would have been pained.

In  a poll conducted last month by the College Board and National Journal  46 percent of respondents åÛåÓ including more than half of 18- to 29-year-olds åÛåÓ said a college degree was not needed to be successful. Only 40 percent of Americans think college is a good investment according to  a 2011 poll by the Pew Research Center .         On a pure dollars-and-cents basis the doubters are wrong. Despite a weak job market for recent graduates workers with a bacheloråÛåªs degree still earn almost twice as much as high school graduates. College might be more expensive than ever but a degree is worth about $365000 over a lifetime after defraying all the direct and indirect costs of going to school. This is a higher payoff than in any other advanced nation  according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .         Still the growing skepticism about the value of a degree has fed into a deeper unease among some economists about the ironclad trust that policy makers alongside many academics have vested in higher education as the weapon of choice to battle widening income disparities and improve the prospects of the middle class in the United States.         It has given new vigor to a critique mostly by thinkers on the left of the political spectrum that challenges the idea that educational disparities are a main driver of economic inequality.         åÛåÏIt is absolutely clear that educational wage differentials have not driven wage inequality over the last 15 yearsåÛå said Lawrence Mishel who heads the Economic Policy Institute a liberal-leaning center for economic policy analysis. åÛåÏWage inequality has grown a lot over the last 15 years and the educational wage premium has changed little.åÛå         The standard analysis of the interplay between technology and education developed by economists like Lawrence Katz and Claudia Goldin of Harvard and David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is based on a simple proposition: Technological progress increased the demand for highly educated workers who could deploy it profitably increasing their incomes. Like trade it rendered many less-skilled occupations obsolete eliminating what used to be solid middle-class jobs.         This rendition of history suggests that improvements in technology åÛåÓ coupled with a college graduation rate that slowed sharply in the 1980s åÛåÓ have been principal drivers of the nationåÛåªs widening income gap leaving workers with less education behind.         But critics like Mr. Mishel point out that this theory has important blind spots.         For instance why have wages for college graduates stagnated over the last decade even as innovation continues at a breathtaking pace? Between 2000 and 2008 the typical earnings of men with at least a bacheloråÛåªs degree fell by more than $2000 after inflation to $70332 a year. Between 2008 and last year they fell a further $3500. Though somewhat less pronounced the pattern is similar for women.         Both sides agree that the overall weakness of the job market since the turn of the millennium is a prime culprit. As Professor Katz noted: åÛåÏThe only moments weåÛåªve had of broadly shared prosperity have been in tight labor markets.åÛå         Still the sluggish job growth of the last decade åÛåÓ following the rapid expansion during the second half of the 1990s åÛåÓ demands an explanation which the interplay between technology and skill does not provide.         åÛåÏWe have no handle on what happened in the 2000såÛå Professor Autor told me. åÛåÏThat is a mystery that nobody I know understands and I canåÛåªt point to a single policy lever or a single external force that would explain it.åÛå         Most notably the skills-and-tech story leaves aside one of the most perplexing and important dynamics of the last 30 years: the rise of the 1 percent a tiny sliver of the population that last year took in almost a dollar out of every $4 generated by the American economy.         åÛåÏI donåÛåªt think the college to noncollege wage premium gives you any insight into why such a large share of the economic gains has accrued to such a tiny share of the populationåÛå said David Card a noted labor economist at the University of California Berkeley.         Mr. MishelåÛåªs preferred explanation of inequalityåÛåªs rise is institutional: a shrinking minimum wage cut into the earnings of the nationåÛåªs least-skilled workers while falling trade barriers deregulation and the decline of labor unions eroded the income of the middle class. The rise of the top 1 percent he believes is mostly about executive pay and the growing footprint of finance.         In coming weeks Mr. Mishel and two co-authors Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute and John Schmitt of the Center for Economic and Policy Research expect to publish a study called åÛåÏDonåÛåªt Blame the Robots: Assessing the Job Polarization Explanation of Growing Wage Inequality.åÛå

You know one when you see one although itåÛåªs probably more accurate to say that you know one when you  donåÛåªt  see one: when the language no longer feels remote when the humanity of the actor and the character seem indivisible when the emotion being expressed is no longer veiled by poetic phrasing but revealed by it creating a shock of recognition in your own heart.         A sterling example is Mark RylanceåÛåªs Olivia in the current Broadway production of  åÛåÏTwelfth Night.åÛå  The surface trappings of Mr. RylanceåÛåªs performance might seem to heighten the sense of falsity that can often prickle and distract us when we are watching Shakespeare. Mr. Rylance is after all clearly a man playing a female role åÛåÓ a convention drawn from the Elizabethan era but one that in our day almost inevitably draws attention to itself. His face is plastered in white makeup and served on the platter of a stiff ruff around his neck. A pouf of hair like a charcoal brioche is coiled atop his head. The movement too is stylized: Gliding across the stage Mr. Rylance seems to have roller skates under his black gown.         And yet when Mr. RylanceåÛåªs Olivia opens her mouth to speak the melancholy in her voice and the air of distracted grief are so palpable that the carapace of theatricality quietly evaporates; before us is a woman in mourning who will soon be transformed into a woman unsettled by stirrings of love later a woman mystified by the apparently unhinged behavior of a servant and later still a woman amazed and delighted (åÛåÏMost wonderful!åÛå) at the strange revelations that bring this most bewitching of Shakespeare comedies to a happy conclusion.         Mr. RylanceåÛåªs presence on Broadway this season in åÛåÏTwelfth NightåÛå and åÛåÏRichard IIIåÛå running in repertory provides a miniature master class in Shakespearean acting. And the preponderance of other Shakespeare productions taking place across the season åÛåÓ with Julie TaymoråÛåªs  åÛåÏMidsummer NightåÛåªs DreamåÛå  just opened and Ethan Hawke in åÛåÏMacbethåÛå on the way åÛåÓ offers a chance to consider the different approaches actors take in bringing ShakespeareåÛåªs great characters to life.         And of course to reflect on why some actors excel where others fall short.         Tim Carroll the director of both åÛåÏTwelfth NightåÛå and åÛåÏRichard IIIåÛå has directed Mr. Rylance in 10 Shakespeare productions dating back more than a decade. What does Mr. Carroll consider to be Mr. RylanceåÛåªs particular gift? An åÛåÏanimal cunningåÛå that gives him the ability to åÛåÏsmell the roomåÛå and shape his performance accordingly; the åÛåÏverbal intelligence to understand in a very personal way every word heåÛåªs speakingåÛå; and a practical savvy that allows him åÛåÏto respond to problems with incredible speedåÛå a necessary attribute in negotiating the complex machinery working inside a Shakespeare play.         Having seen Mr. Rylance as Hamlet Richard II and the Duke in åÛåÏMeasure for MeasureåÛå among other roles I have always marveled at how he imbues these various characters with a quality I can only call soulfulness a sense that their interior landscapes are being revealed to us moment by moment. ShakespeareåÛåªs characters can seem remote in more studied or stilted performances but Mr. Rylance always seems to be breathing the same air we do.         Joseph Timms left and Mark Rylance in the all-male production of åÛåÏRichard IIIåÛå at the Belasco Theater. His tutelage in Shakespeare dates back to his teenage years in Milwaukee where he first began performing in high school under a teacher who revered the work of Tyrone Guthrie one of the great classical directors of his generation. But styles in Shakespearean performance evolve over the years and Mr. RylanceåÛåªs career exemplifies the manner in which ideals become conventions and are eventually rebelled against.         When Mr. Rylance moved to London in 1978 to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts he had absorbed what he calls the åÛåÏEnglish styleåÛå through his Guthrie-enthralled teacher åÛåÏconscious considered very full of form and prepared effects.åÛå         He found himself among a generation ready to rebel against this aesthetic reign. åÛåÏI arrived in London and was very surprised to find that the actors I was working with didnåÛåªt care for Olivier or GielgudåÛå he said in an interview. åÛåÏThey were admiring the truthfulness of Montgomery Clift Marlon Brando of course Robert Mitchum and other film actors. So my focus was directed back across the pond to actors I hadnåÛåªt paid attention to.åÛå

If such an agreement were signed it would represent an Iranian victory åÛåÓ and an American defeat. The Iranians would be able to maintain their nuclear program and continue to enrich uranium while the Americans and their allies would loosen the economic siege on  Iran  and allow IranåÛåªs supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei the economic oxygen needed to sustain his autocratic regime.         Yes IranåÛåªs race to the bomb would be slowed down åÛåÓ but an accord would guarantee that it would eventually cross the finish line. The Geneva mind-set resembles a Munich mind-set: It would create the illusion of peace-in-our-time while paving the way to a nuclear-Iran-in-our-time.         But donåÛåªt blame  President Obama . Indeed this American defeat was set in motion long before he took office.         What three American presidents four Israeli prime ministers and a dozen European leaders vowed would never happen is actually happening. What was not to be is almost a reality. The Iranian bomb is nearly here.         Why wasnåÛåªt the West able to mobilize its political economic and military resources in time to force Tehran to give up its nuclear ambition?         The answer may be described as a spelling error.         After 9/11 the United States was determined to strike back destroy terrorist sanctuaries and display its imperial might. President  George W. Bush  chose to do all of this in Afghanistan and Iraq. Afghanistan may have been a mistake but it was an understandable one: Al Qaeda enjoyed the TalibanåÛåªs support and had found refuge in Taliban-controlled territory. But invading Iraq was an incomprehensible mistake as there were no links between Saddam Hussein and the 19 terrorists who attacked New York and Washington in September 2001.         If Mr. Bush had decided to display American leadership and exercise American power by launching a diplomatic campaign against Iran rather than a military one against Iraq 10 years ago the United StatesåÛåª international standing would be far greater today.         The Bush administrationåÛåªs decision to go after Iraq rather than Iran was a fatal one and the long-term consequences are only now becoming clear namely a devastating American failure in the battle to prevent a nuclear Iran reflected in WashingtonåÛåªs willingness to sign a deeply flawed agreement.         Mr. BushåÛåªs responsibility for the disaster now unfolding is twofold: He failed to target Iran a decade ago and created a climate that made it very difficult to target Iran today. The Bush administration didnåÛåªt initiate a political-economic siege on Iran when it was weak and Mr. Bush weakened America by exhausting its economic power and military might in a futile war. By the time American resolve was needed to fend off a genuine global threat the necessary determination was no longer there. It had been wasted on the wrong cause.         The correct way to confront the Iranian threat would have been to establish a broad coalition including Russia the European Union Sunni Arab countries Israel and the United States. This would have placed IranåÛåªs leaders in a real stranglehold and forced them to abandon their nuclear project åÛåÓ just as Libya did in 2003.         The Republican Party could have done that in 2003 or 2005 or 2007. But Republican leaders squandered the opportunity. Worse still the United States got bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan and that sucked all the oxygen out of AmericaåÛåªs lungs. Mr. Bush passed on to Mr. Obama a nation that had lost much of the resolve it had possessed. When faced with a real threat to world peace AmericaåÛåªs will was spent. It had evaporated in the violent streets of Basra and Baghdad.         Sure Mr. Obama has made mistakes too. After coming to office he wasted time on a futile policy of engagement and then on ineffective sanctions. He ignored the British French Israelis Egyptians and Saudis who warned him that he was being naÌÄåøve and turned his back on the freedom-seeking Iranian masses in June 2009. When Mr. Obama finally endorsed assertive diplomacy and punitive sanctions in 2011 and 2012 it was too little too late.         But Mr. Obama was operating within the smoky ruins of the strategic disaster he had inherited.         After Iraq America is a traumatized nation with a limited attention span for problems in the Middle East. The empire is weary. It has lost the ardor and wisdom needed to deal with the cruelest of the worldåÛåªs regions and with the most dangerous of the worldåÛåªs evil powers.         The Geneva agreement being negotiated is an illusion. The so-called moderate president of Iran Hassan Rouhani is an illusion too. So is the hope that IranåÛåªs supreme leader can be appeased. Because America missed the opportunity for assertive diplomacy all the options now left on the table are dire ones.         Rather than pursuing a dangerous interim agreement the West must insist that all the centrifuges in Iran stop spinning while a final agreement is negotiated. President Obama was right to demand a settlement freeze in the West Bank in 2009. Now he must demand a total centrifuge freeze in Iran.

Cuomo on Tuesday embraced a package of proposals to reduce the effects of property estate and business taxes setting the stage for a battle over revenue collection that is expected to dominate the New York State legislative session that begins next month.         Mr. Cuomo a Democrat has said that cutting taxes will be his top priority next year åÛåÓ when he and all state lawmakers will be up for re-election åÛåÓ and his comments on Tuesday were an early preview of how he might seek to accomplish that.         But the contours of a debate also immediately emerged with questions about the proposals from some of the governoråÛåªs allies. A leading business official who has championed Mr. CuomoåÛåªs agenda questioned whether the new plan was fair to New York City taxpayers; labor unions said provisions unfairly favored the rich; and the powerful speaker of the State Assembly said the governmentåÛåªs priority should be providing money for public education.         Mr. Cuomo has tried to grapple with the stateåÛåªs high-tax burden several times since he took office in 2011; that year he persuaded the Legislature to limit annual increases in property taxes and then called lawmakers back to Albany to cut taxes for middle-class earners while creating a new tax bracket for high-income earners. Earlier this year he won approval of a $350 family tax rebate; the first checks will be sent to homeowners shortly before the fall 2014 election.         Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday traveled to Old Westbury in highly taxed Nassau County to unveil and praise a set of tax-cutting  recommendations  from a panel led by former Gov. George E. Pataki a Republican and former State Comptroller H. Carl McCall a Democrat.         åÛåÏPeople are still strugglingåÛå Mr. Cuomo told reporters åÛåÏand to the extent we can cut taxes and help them and their households thatåÛåªs exactly what government should be doing.åÛå         The most striking of the recommendations are two meant to mitigate the effect of high property taxes.         The commission suggested a so-called property tax circuit-breaker åÛåÓ a tax credit for households in which property taxes exceed a certain portion of family income. The proposal drew praise from liberals who said it would provide help to households that needed it most but drew criticism from business groups which said it amounted to shifting the tax burden not reducing it.         More unusual was a proposal for the state to create a program that would effectively wipe out any increases in local property taxes for two years for homeowners outside of New York City. The state would provide a tax rebate equal to the amount by which the individual homeowneråÛåªs tax bill increased.         Only homeowners in localities that stay under the stateåÛåªs annual cap on property tax increases would be eligible for the rebate. It would not apply to New York City homeowners because the tax cap does not apply to the city.         The commission proposed raising the exemption from the stateåÛåªs estate tax to $5.25 million from $1 million and lowering the estate tax rate. Several other proposals would cut taxes paid by businesses; one would trim the corporate income tax and another would change the way banks are taxed.         While legislative leaders and business groups offered praise for some of the commissionåÛåªs proposals many recommendations are controversial and legislators whose approval is needed for tax law changes are divided. The panel said its proposals would cost $2 billion annually including $1 billion that would go to property tax relief for homeowners.         Mr. CuomoåÛåªs aides said by limiting spending in next yearåÛåªs budget the state would have a surplus that could be used for tax cuts.         State Senator Dean G. Skelos of Long Island the leader of the Senate Republicans who have advocated tax cuts said åÛåÏThe plan must go further.åÛå Republicans control the Senate in coalition with a small group of breakaway Democrats.         But the Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver a Manhattan Democrat suggested a reluctance to set tax-cutting as a priority saying it was åÛåÏimportant that we have the resources necessary to fund vital programsåÛå like public schools. And hinting at concern about whether the tax package would be unfair to New York City he said that any package åÛåÏshould be premised on a principle of fairness to all New Yorkers åÛåÓ city residents suburbanites and rural residents alike.åÛå

With this in mind I decided to work on light fish and seafood dinners for this week‰Ûªs Recipes for Health. They should provide you with a respite from rich food during this shortened window between Thanksgiving and Christmas. I bought several fillets of Alaskan cod knowing that the Alaskan state fisheries use sustainable practices. Cod is a very mild tasting fish that has a fairly firm texture. I oven steamed the fillets using the same technique I use for salmon and made three different sauces to serve with the fish. Oven steaming worked beautifully. I love using this cooking method because you don‰Ûªt need any extra oil except to oil the foil on your baking sheet and you won‰Ûªt be left with lingering odors of fried fish in your kitchen. It is a very forgiving method for preparing fish and lends itself to do-ahead cooking. In addition to the cod with sauces I made a refreshing and satisfying ceviche and I also bought some clams which I steamed and served with a spicy tomato sauce. All of these dishes are light even with the robust sauces. They are nice not only for family dinners but also if you are entertaining this holiday season and want to try to keep the menu on the light side. Alaskan Cod in Sweet and Sour Pepper Sauce:  A sauce that can double as a vegetable side dish. Cod Fillets With Blender Cilantro and Yogurt Sauce:  A cool sauce over hot fish makes for a delicious meal. Oven-Steamed Cod or Mahi Mahi in Green Tomatillo Salsa:  Tomatillo sauce works with a wide range of fish. Cod Ceviche:  A light satisfying meal that can be served over a bed of spinach. Steamed Clams in Spicy Tomato Sauce:  Clams are high in Omega 3 fatty acids low in calories and very high in iron. Martha Rose Shulman on healthful cooking.

But as consumers dig into the details they are finding that the deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs are often much higher than what is typical in employer-sponsored health plans.         Until now it was almost impossible for people using the federal health care website to see the deductible amounts which consumers pay before coverage kicks in. But federal officials finally relented last week and added a åÛåÏwindow shoppingåÛå feature that displays data on deductibles.         For policies offered in the federal exchange as in many states the annual deductible often tops $5000 for an individual and $10000 for a couple.         Insurers devised the new policies on the assumption that consumers would pick a plan based mainly on price as reflected in the premium. But insurance plans with lower premiums generally have higher deductibles.         In El Paso Tex. for example for a husband and wife both age 35 one of the cheapest plans on the federal exchange offered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield has a premium less than $300 a month but the annual deductible is more than $12000. For a 45-year-old couple seeking insurance on the federal exchange in Saginaw Mich. a policy with a premium of $515 a month has a deductible of $10000.         In Santa Cruz Calif. where the exchange is run by the state Robert Aaron a self-employed 56-year-old engineer said he was looking for a low-cost plan. The best one he could find had a premium of $488 a month. But the annual deductible was $5000 and that he said åÛåÏsounds really high.åÛå         By contrast according to the Kaiser Family Foundation the average deductible in employer-sponsored health plans is $1135.         åÛåÏDeductibles for many plans in the insurance exchanges are pretty highåÛå said Stan Dorn a health policy expert at the Urban Institute. åÛåÏThese plans are more generous than whatåÛåªs prevalent in the current individual insurance market but significantly less generous than most employer-sponsored insurance.åÛå         Caroline F. Pearson a vice president of Avalere Health a consulting company that has analyzed hundreds of plans said: åÛåÏThe premiums are lower than expected but consumers on the exchange will often face high deductibles and high co-payments for medical services and prescription drugs before they reach the cap on out-of-pocket costsåÛå $6350 for an individual and $12700 for a family.         Those limits provide significant protection even though those sums are substantial for most consumers. In addition the federal website HealthCare.gov informs people that they may qualify for subsidies to reduce their out-of-pocket costs if their household income is below 250 percent of the federal poverty level meaning that it is less than $28725 for an individual or $48825 for a family of three.         These åÛåÏcost-sharing reductionsåÛå are available for a specific kind of midlevel plan known as a silver plan. People with lower incomes can get more help with out-of-pocket costs but only if they choose silver plans.         Mr. Dorn said the government had not done much to inform people of these potential savings. åÛåÏConsumers are giving up cost-sharing reductions of enormous value if they enroll in a bronze plan because it has the lowest premiumåÛå he said.         Plans in the marketplace are separated into four categories åÛåÓ bronze silver gold and platinum åÛåÓ indicating the generosity of coverage or the share of costs paid by insurance for an average enrollee.         Many people buying insurance on the federal and state exchanges are expected to qualify for subsidies. But in the first month for reasons that are not clear only 30 percent qualified. The others must pay the full premium and will be subject to the full deductible.         Most people shopping in the exchanges are expected to choose bronze or silver plans which provide less generous coverage than most employer-sponsored plans.

He might also update the title of his famous essay on the need for a revolutionary vanguard party asking not åÛåÏ What Is To Be Done åÛå but åÛåÏWhy the Heck Was It Done?åÛå         Since construction finished this week the gigantic luxury trunk which is just steps from the Kremlin walls and was set to hold a charity exhibition of suitcases by the Paris-based designer has been panned on social networks denounced at the Duma and disowned by GUM the luxury department store that abuts Red Square and approved the temporary exhibition.         In the highest-ranking condemnation yet of the 30-foot-tall 100-foot-wide trunk an official in the Presidential Administration on Wednesday said the temporary pavilion was unauthorized and demanded that it be åÛåÏdismantled immediatelyåÛå several state news agencies reported.         Despite a legal ban on anything that åÛåÏviolates the historical appearanceåÛå of Red Square the site of the Lenin mausoleum and yearly military parades celebrating the Soviet victory over Germany in World War II the space has hosted concerts dirt-bike stunt shows a commercial ice-skating rink and a Dior exhibition in a gigantic metallic pavilion in recent years.         åÛåÏEverything that is happening on Red Square is unacceptableåÛå Tatyana Fedosova 60 who was dressed in a bright red winter coat said as she tilted her head back to gaze at the trunk during her lunch break. åÛåÏThis is a sacred place. Our former leaders are buried here. I thought that the ice-skating rink here was not great but this is too much.åÛå         Lawmakers began lashing out at Louis Vuitton earlier this week. Sergey Obukhov a Communist deputy for the Duma called the square a åÛåÏsacred place for the Russian government.åÛå He added åÛåÏThere are symbols that are forbidden to debase or defile.åÛå Aleksandr Sidyakin a member of President Vladimir V. PutinåÛåªs governing United Russia party demanded an investigation into whether the structure violated any laws on advertising.         GUM the department store said in a statement Wednesday that it had told the Russian representative of Louis Vuitton to tear down the exhibition hall in light of åÛåÏthe position of a part of the population.åÛå         This is not the first time Louis Vuitton has become enmeshed into Russian politics in its marketing campaigns. In 2007 a  magazine advertisement  showed the former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev riding in a car past the Berlin Wall with a Louis Vuitton bag stuffed with liberal Russian magazines.         But with special attention now being paid to the beautification of MoscowåÛåªs public spaces and social networks swiftly churning out criticism and Photoshopped pictures åÛåÓ like one of LeninåÛåªs tomb reupholstered to look like a Louis Vuitton bag åÛåÓ the public ridicule swiftly led to official threats.         The fashion house did not respond Wednesday evening to questions on whether the exhibition hall would be removed but Natalia Vodianova a fashion model and the head of the charitable fund set to receive the ticket receipts from the exhibition said in a Facebook post åÛåÏLet us hope that the exhibition is not canceled but just moved to another place.åÛå         Standing by the metal barriers installed around it on Wednesday Aleksandr Dubov a 35-year-old tourist from Yekaterinburg said he had åÛåÏnothing personally against the suitcase.åÛå         åÛåÏAt least they could leave it up until the exhibitionåÛå said Mr. Dubov dressed in a leather jacket and carrying a bag made from fake alligator skin. As he circled the building he stopped occasionally to snap pictures.         åÛåÏIs this a sacred place?åÛå he asked gesturing to the other side of the square. åÛåÏThere is already an enormous mall on it.åÛå

A typical day for the atypical letter writer who had changed from his mud-splattered clothes to the robes he once wore as a high official in the Florentine republic.         Toward the end of the letter Machiavelli mentions for the first time a åÛåÏlittle workåÛå he was writing on politics. This little work was of course åÛåÏThe Prince.åÛå         One of the remarkable things about åÛåÏThe PrinceåÛå is not just what Machiavelli wrote but that he was able to write at all. Just 10 months earlier he endured the åÛåÏstrappadoåÛå: Hands tied behind his back he was strung to a prison ceiling and repeatedly plunged to the floor.         Having at the time just been given the task of overseeing the foreign policy and defense of his native city he was thrown out of his office when the Medici family returned to power. The new rulers suspected him of plotting against them and wanted to hear what he had to say. Machiavelli prided himself on not uttering a word.         He may well have saved his words for åÛåÏThe PrinceåÛå dedicated to a member of the family who ordered his torture: Lorenzo de Medici. With the book Machiavelli sought to persuade Lorenzo that he was a friend whose experience in politics and knowledge of the ancients made him an invaluable adviser.         History does not tell us if Lorenzo bothered to read the book. But if he did he would have learned from his would-be friend that there are in fact no friends in politics.         åÛåÏThe PrinceåÛå is a manual for those who wish to win and keep power. The Renaissance was awash in such how-to guides but MachiavelliåÛåªs was different. To be sure he counsels a prince on how to act toward his enemies using force and fraud in war. But his true novelty resides in how we should think about our friends. It is at the bookåÛåªs heart in the chapter devoted to this issue that Machiavelli proclaims his originality.         Set aside what you would like to imagine about politics Machiavelli writes and instead go straight to the truth of how things really work or what he calls the åÛåÏeffectual truth.åÛå You will see that allies in politics whether at home or abroad are not friends.         Perhaps others had been deluded about the distinction because the same word in Italian åÛåÓ åÛåÏamiciåÛå åÛåÓ is used for both concepts. Whoever imagines allies are friends Machiavelli warns ensures his ruin rather than his preservation.         There may be no students more in need of this insight yet less likely to accept it than contemporary Americans both in and outside the government. Like the political moralizers Machiavelli aims to subvert we still believe a leader should be virtuous: generous and merciful honest and faithful.         Yet Machiavelli teaches that in a world where so many are not good you must learn to be able to not be good. The virtues taught in our secular and religious schools are incompatible with the virtues one must practice to safeguard those same institutions. The power of the lion and the cleverness of the fox: These are the qualities a leader must harness to preserve the republic.         For such a leader allies are friends when it is in their interest to be. (We can with difficulty accept this lesson when embodied by a Charles de Gaulle; we have even greater difficulty when it is taught by say Hamid Karzai.) WhatåÛåªs more Machiavelli says leaders must at times inspire fear not only in their foes but even in their allies åÛåÓ and even in their own ministers.         What would Machiavelli have thought when President Obama apologized for the fiasco of his health care rollout? Far from earning respect he would say all he received was contempt. As one of MachiavelliåÛåªs favorite exemplars Cesare Borgia grasped heads must sometimes roll. (Though in BorgiaåÛåªs case he meant it quite literally though he preferred slicing bodies in half and leaving them in a public square.)         Machiavelli has long been called a teacher of evil. But the author of åÛåÏThe PrinceåÛå never urged evil for evilåÛåªs sake. The proper aim of a leader is to maintain his state (and not incidentally his job). Politics is an arena where following virtue often leads to the ruin of a state whereas pursuing what appears to be vice results in security and well-being. In short there are never easy choices and prudence consists of knowing how to recognize the qualities of the hard decisions you face and choosing the less bad as what is the most good.         Those of us who see the world if not in Manichaean at least in Hollywoodian terms will recoil at such claims. Perhaps we are right to do so but we would be wrong to dismiss them out of hand. If MachiavelliåÛåªs teaching concerning friends and allies in politics is deeply disconcerting it is because it goes to the bone of our religious convictions and moral conventions. This explains why he remains as reviled but also as revered today as he was in his own age.

City officials will soon anoint him an honorary citizen. A sponge cake filled with hazelnut and white chocolate has been named in his honor.         More than a century after Giovanni de Blasio left the hillside near Naples seeking prosperity in America residents here are celebrating the election of his grandson Bill as the next mayor of New York.         They have placed campaign posters in shop windows clipped news stories and hung American flags from balconies. About 100 people gathered in a former movie theater to watch a broadcast of Mr. de Blasio on election night staying awake into the wee hours to hear his victory speech live. The room erupted in applause when he mentioned the town thanking its residents with the words åÛåÏGrazie a tutti!åÛå         Mr. de Blasio has become something of an Italian sensation within and beyond this townåÛåªs medieval walls. A Neapolitan artisan fashioned a terra cotta figurine of Mr. de Blasio with tricolor sash; a pizza-maker wrote åÛåÏNapoli Love de BlasioåÛå in mozzarella on a pie. In New York candidate de Blasio offered interviews in Italian; his campaign staff jokingly designated a press aide who spoke a bit of the language as the åÛåÏItalian deskåÛå and on election night 15 journalists from  Italy  showed up to cover the festivities at the Park Slope Armory Y.M.C.A.         For Mr. de Blasio Italy represents more than an ancestral lodestone. His connection to the country has been a singular force in shaping his life an identity he claimed as his family was falling apart.         Born Warren Wilhelm Jr. to an Italian-American mother and a German-American father the future mayor asserted his Italian heritage as an adolescent. His father struggled with alcoholism left the family  and ultimately killed himself . Mr. de BlasioåÛåªs Italian relatives became increasingly important sources of support. In high school he tried to start an Italian club and he began using his motheråÛåªs maiden name de Blasio. His classmates referring to his political ambitions and his fondness for Italian sandwiches called him Senator Provolone.         In an interview Mr. de Blasio said his Italian roots had grounded him at a difficult time. åÛåÏThere was a strength a warmth a coherence in my motheråÛåªs family that was sort of the obvious antidote to me to what I was experiencing in the foreground of my lifeåÛå he said.         He said the connection began with a trip to SantåÛåªAgata in the mid-1970s when he was a teenager.         åÛåÏSuddenly this world opened up to meåÛå he said. åÛåÏThereåÛåªs this whole other part of life that I had not understood and it just rushed into my brain and it was very compelling it was very reinforcing it was very reassuring.åÛå         Mr. de BlasioåÛåªs love of Italy grew stronger over the years. He chose Italian names for his children Chiara and Dante and to this day he stocks his kitchen with fresh mozzarella and bottles of red wine from southern Italy. Hoping to refine his accent he practices his Italian with his barber who also shares Italian newspapers with him.         SantåÛåªAgata with about 11000 residents is northeast of Naples in an agricultural region with high unemployment. Mr. de Blasio has visited SantåÛåªAgata half a dozen times in his life; his last trip was in 2010 with his wife and two children. For the past month the community has been Mr. de BlasioåÛåªs loudest åÛåÓ and proudest åÛåÓ overseas booster.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs redemption for the entire villageåÛå said Domenico Lingelli 33 owner of Bar Normanno an ice cream and pastry shop where the mayor-elect with his grandfather visited to sample the house specialty: the åÛåÏNormangeloåÛå a cream gelato with sour black cherry and sponge cake covered with hazelnut chocolate.         åÛåÏSo many people have left here to now scorn usåÛå Mr. Lingelli said. åÛåÏHe proved that great minds originally come from this small village too.åÛå         Mr. Lingelli whose father spelled out the mayor-electåÛåªs name in cocoa atop a sponge cake said smiling åÛåÏMaybe this will make him come back.åÛå         Some residents are planning trips to New York to see Mr. de Blasio inaugurated on Jan. 1.         åÛåÏHe made the American dream come trueåÛå Carmine Valentino the townåÛåªs mayor said. åÛåÏBut he didnåÛåªt forget his roots. ItåÛåªs a message of hope for us all.åÛå         Mr. de BlasioåÛåªs grandfather came from an affluent family that lived in an elegant two-story palazzo just off the main street. In 1905 he decided to leave for New York where he found work selling Italian meats. At the time emigration was rampant; that year 7849 residents left the area.

The state news agency Xinhua said China would provide $1.4 million in relief supplies including tents and blankets on top of $100000 in cash from the government and another $100000 from the Chinese Red Cross offered earlier this week.         The Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said Thursday that China had never intended that the amount of assistance will åÛåÏnever changeåÛå and had adjusted its contribution according to the needs. åÛåÏAn overwhelming majority of Chinese people are sympathetic with the people of the PhilippinesåÛå he said.         On Wednesday Mr. Qin had remained firm on ChinaåÛåªs first offer and said that one consideration in ChinaåÛåªs initial announcement was that Chinese people had also suffered during Typhoon Haiyan. Chinese state media reported that eight people died in China when the tail end of the storm hit southern China.         ChinaåÛåªs initially modest donation to the Philippines where a huge international relief effort including deliveries of aid by American soldiers is underway appeared to be based on the frosty relations between the two countries. In contrast China pledged $1.5 million to Pakistan its close ally after an earthquake killed 500 people in September.         Territorial disputes over islands in the South China Sea have poisoned relations between Beijing and Manila since early 2012 and the Philippines is taking its case against China to an international arbitration tribunal. The Philippines angered China this year by accepting a gift of naval vessels from Japan and by supporting JapanåÛåªs plans to strengthen its military.         Another factor in determining the initial size of the gift was the hostility among Chinese Internet commentators toward foreign aid and to aid to the Philippines in particular Chinese experts said.         åÛåÏThere must have been a debateåÛå inside the government about how much aid to give and how to supply it said Qin Yaqing professor of international studies at the Foreign Affairs University in Beijing. åÛåÏChinese culture takes an incremental way of doing things so as not to cause more trouble with the domesticåÛå audience he said.         But when he informally polled his students he said he found most believed that the initial response was too little. Most students described the hostility toward the Philippines expressed on ChinaåÛåªs Internet as åÛåÏirresponsible and irrationalåÛå he said.         The early decision on how much aid to give to the Philippines was most likely made at the mid-level of the government he said. åÛåÏI donåÛåªt believe the leaders are that stupid as not to provide assistanceåÛå he said.         An online poll on the Phoenix News website on Wednesday showed that 95 percent of the 60000 votes cast were against China donating to the Philippines.         In an unusual turn the newspaper Global Times which often projects a nationalist editorial line criticized the first offer of aid as too small. It noted in an editorial on Tuesday that the Philippines was a two-hour flight from ChinaåÛåªs southern coast but countries much farther away including Germany and Chile responded quickly sending aircraft loaded with supplies.         A tally by international aid agencies on Thursday showed that ChinaåÛåªs new total of $1.6 million was roughly on par with Ireland ($1.4 million) Italy ($1.3 million) and Spain ($1.8 million).         Along with the distribution of water purification kits food and emergency shelter the United States dispatched the George Washington aircraft carrier to the Philippines with 80 aircraft and 5000 troops on board. Two United States Navy ships arrived in advance of the carrier on Thursday.         åÛåÏA twisted relationship between the two countries cased by maritime disputes is not the reason to block joint efforts to combat natural disasteråÛå the Global Times editorial said. åÛåÏChina shouldnåÛåªt be absent in the international relief efforts.åÛå         Global Times also said the åÛåÏonline outcriesåÛå about China offering foreign aid in recent years did not represent the mainstream.         Indeed the paper urged the government to educate the Chinese people on the virtues of foreign aid. It noted that overseas Chinese in the Philippines had rallied to ChinaåÛåªs side during disasters on the mainland. åÛåÏItåÛåªs legitimate that we provide assistance when they sufferåÛå the paper said.         The internal government debate on how much to give to the Philippines was probably held at the Foreign Ministry said Jin Canrong professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. åÛåÏThey probably believed China has to contribute something but not that muchåÛå he said.         Critics should remember he added that when China suffered devastating floods in 1998 the United States sent only $20000.

In a statement  Doug McMillon who is leaving the international post to become the top executive said of Mr. Cheesewright: åÛåÏWe have strengthened our business and gained market share in the majority of our international markets and he had a key role in that success.åÛå         Like Mr. McMillon Mr. Cheesewright has been with the company for many years. He began his career at Walmart in 1999.         åÛåÏHe does seem like a very natural candidateåÛå said Faye Landes an analyst at Cowen and Company. åÛåÏHeåÛåªs their one-man SWAT team. HeåÛåªs been sent to work on a lot of very important international missions and heåÛåªs been successful.åÛå         Walmart has already begun to adjust its international strategy.         In October the company announced it would close about 50 underperforming stores in China and Brazil delay indefinitely its plan to open hundreds of superstores across India and reduce by a third the 20 to 22 million square feet of retail space it had wanted to add internationally.         That same month the company said it would accelerate development in China adding up to 110 new facilities.         Walmart International has also faced scandal in recent years. The New York Times  reported last year  that officials at Walmart de Mexico paid bribes to facilitate its expansion and the Justice Department has been investigating whether the company violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in that country. (The activities being investigated preceded Mr. McMillonåÛåªs tenure as president of Walmart International a company spokeswoman said.)         Mr. Cheesewright 51 has been in charge of operations in Europe the Middle East and Africa and Canada. As chief executive of Walmart Canada he oversaw adding the companyåÛåªs supercenters to the country. He helped develop and expand online grocery delivery at Asda WalmartåÛåªs operations in Britain. And he serves on the board of WalmartåÛåªs e-commerce business in China Yihaodian.         åÛåÏHeåÛåªs been very capable in different geographiesåÛå Ms. Landes said. åÛåÏIn a global company you really want that.åÛå         Before Walmart Mr. Cheesewright worked at Mars Confectionery. He first joined WalmartåÛåªs British operations in 1999.         Mr. Cheesewright will start in his new position at the beginning of February the same time Mr. McMillon will replace Michael T. Duke 64 who has been WalmartåÛåªs chief executive since 2009.         åÛåÏIåÛåªm honored to be named to lead our international business at a time when our customers around the world need us more than everåÛå Mr. Cheesewright said in a statement.         In the meantime Walmart the largest retailer in the United States is barreling through a competitive holiday season trying to snare every available customer with promotions blazing. On Friday Walmart will bring back åÛåÏBlack Friday-like pricesåÛå on items including an iPad mini and Monster headphones and it will keep those prices in place through Christmas Eve.

But it is a different place than the crime-ravaged city he came to in 1994. And he said he was going to be a different kind of commissioner overseeing a different kind of policing.         åÛåÏIn this city I want every New Yorker to talk about åÛå÷their policeåÛåª åÛå÷my policeåÛåªÌâåÊåÛå Mr. Bratton said after his appointment was announced by Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio before reading from a childrenåÛåªs book about police work he said he had cherished since he was 9.         In 1994 the message was different: åÛåÏWe will fight for every house in the city; we will fight for every street; we will fight for every boroughåÛå he said at the time. åÛåÏAnd we will win.åÛå         Back then the hard-driving press-savvy Mr. Bratton could be found dining out among city luminaries and on the covers of newspapers and national magazines. He received a lot of credit for historic drops in crime rates even as the trends in New York coincided with those around the country. Such prominence drove a very public wedge between him and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani a former prosecutor who pushed him out just two years after appointing him. The mayor has the full authority to hire and fire the commissioner.         On Thursday Mr. Bratton 66 said he had åÛåÏlearned a lotåÛå since the last time he ran the New York department the largest in the country and people familiar with his thinking suggested that significant changes were in store.         Before making the decision to bring him back Mr. de Blasio said he had been reassured by conversations with others who had worked with Mr. Bratton especially in Los Angeles where he lead the police from 2002 to 2009.         Mr. Bratton said: åÛåÏI report to the mayor. I am not the mayor.åÛå         But his is perhaps the single most important and visible appointment to be made by Mr. de Blasio who was elected partially because of his criticism of the policeåÛåªs aggressive use of the stop-and-frisk tactics. Mr. Bratton has been in law enforcement for four decades including stints as commissioner in Boston as well as Los Angeles but this may be his biggest challenge: keeping crime at historic lows åÛåÓ just more than 300 murders so far this year åÛåÓ while mending the relationship with minorities and not upstaging his boss.         In January Mr. Bratton will replace Raymond W. Kelly the police commissioner since 2002.         A bright mood reigned at a community court in Red Hook Brooklyn where Mr. de Blasio made the announcement which had been widely anticipated. The mayor-elect referred to an old headline calling Mr. Bratton åÛåÏAmericaåÛåªs Top CopåÛå before allowing him to take the microphone. åÛåÏWelcome backåÛå Mr. de Blasio said.         åÛåÏYou would bring that magazine cover upåÛå Mr. Bratton replied.         It was a moment of glory light years from the day Mr. Bratton began his policing career in Boston in 1970. He still speaks with the cityåÛåªs accent.         He first came to New York to lead the transit police in 1990 going after fare-beaters and other low-level offenders in broad sweeps that also caught more serious criminals.         The approach was derived from the åÛåÏbroken windowsåÛå theory of policing which holds that by cracking down in troubled neighborhoods on small but highly visible crimes of disorder such as turnstile jumping and prostitution more serious crimes fall as well. It is a theory that Mr. Bratton has long espoused. Some researchers over the years since have questioned the efficacy of the theory but Mr. de Blasio said he was a firm believer that it worked.         From the transit police he moved on to lead the Boston Police Department briefly before returning to New York City as commissioner in 1994. It was at a time when murders were around 2000 a year when squeegee-men were a fixture on the streets and drug-dealers and prostitutes flourished in the open. It was also a time of widespread corruption in the department.

Mr. McDonough the White House chief of staff likes to stroll outside from time to time. It helps clear his head when he has a lot on his mind.         On this particular day he was just hours away from a government shutdown that would test his presidentåÛåªs resolve and a day away from the debut of a new health care program that would test his presidentåÛåªs legacy. åÛåÏIåÛåªm a keep-score guy; I always have beenåÛå Mr. McDonough said in an interview as he circumnavigated the lawn. åÛåÏSo IåÛåªm good with the idea that there are scores being kept.åÛå         The scores are now rolling in and his team is down in the second half. Although the government shutdown proved a political victory as the White House stared down Republicans in Congress the botched health care rollout erased the momentum and plunged Mr. ObamaåÛåªs public standing to the lowest of his tenure. Last weekendåÛåªs six-month  nuclear deal with Iran  returned Mr. Obama to a position of leading rather than reacting but it still drew fire from various directions.         At the center of these challenges is Mr. McDonough the ramrod-straight scorekeeper from Minnesota with the close-cropped prematurely graying hair and the bearing of a military man even though he never served. A fanatically fit workaholic hard charger who sometimes left bruised feelings across the administration in Mr. ObamaåÛåªs first term Mr. McDonough 43 has become a much-praised right-hand man in Mr. ObamaåÛåªs troubled second term.         He is the first aide the president sees in the morning the last he sees at night and the closest to him of the five men who have served as his chief of staff. Unlike his predecessors Mr. McDonough came from the foreign policy arena without the same experience in the domestic policy that dominates the White House. He now finds himself fixing the health care debacle he did not see coming preparing for the next spending showdown with Congress and trying to rescue an imperiled presidency.         åÛåÏLook itåÛåªs a tough time for the presidency and Denis is leadingåÛå said Rahm Emanuel one of his predecessors and now the mayor of Chicago who spoke recently with Mr. McDonough. åÛåÏNobody can feel good when this is going on. My whole thing is donåÛåªt beat yourself up. The question is can you see a map and can you see the light forward.åÛå          Tangled in Health Mess   Mr. McDonoughåÛåªs failure to head off the health care problems surprised those who see him as a man of discipline and attention to detail. But current and former administration officials say that after 10 months on the job one problem may have been that he stretched himself too thin and tried to do too much himself.         åÛåÏDenis is playing the role of chief of staff legislative director chief strategist and head of the accountability and implementation officeåÛå said a former colleague who asked for anonymity to speak more candidly. åÛåÏOne man canåÛåªt play all of the infield.åÛå         In the months before the rollout Mr. McDonough worked closely with Kathleen Sebelius the health and human services secretary but did not see the warning signs clearly. He expressed confidence in the system only hours before the Oct. 1 kickoff. åÛåÏThereåÛåªs hundreds of people who worked all through last weekend as they have now through many many weekends to make sure that everything is in place tested firm ready to rollåÛå he said as he walked the South Lawn.         In hindsight of course that confidence was misplaced. åÛåÏItåÛåªs not that they took their eye off the ball åÛåÓ they spent a lot of time on itåÛå said John D. Podesta who helped run Mr. ObamaåÛåªs transition and remains close to the White House. åÛåÏThe question is whether they spent their time on the right things. It wasnåÛåªt centralized. You can decide that was ObamaåÛåªs problem or DenisåÛåªs problem or KathleenåÛåªs problem. But it was a problem.åÛå         Mr. McDonoughåÛåªs defenders say the real mistakes were made before he took over when the White House put its policy officials rather than outside experts in charge of setting up the major web operation for the health care exchanges. Mr. ObamaåÛåªs ill-founded promise that any Americans who liked their health plans could keep them likewise preceded Mr. McDonoughåÛåªs tenure.        
1.0,4.48,4.997358491,6.62,1273.377,0.3125,1210.338,37.0,1253.8210000000001,804.0,1475.3120000000001,23.0,Walking down Eighth Avenue a few weeks ago I made sure my backpack was fully zipped shut. Inside was a modest stash of pot bought just an hour or so earlier. A friend knew someone in that world and after an introduction then a quiet discreet meeting I was on my way to the subway. Never before had I walked through Midtown Manhattan with it on my person. There were four cookies in vacuum-sealed pouches åÛåÓ åÛåÏediblesåÛå is the technical term åÛåÓ and then a few pinches of what was described as åÛåÏherb.åÛå         The innovations of  Michael R. Bloomberg  as mayor are legion but his enforcement of marijuana laws has broken all records. More people have been arrested for marijuana possession than any other crime on the books. From 2002 through 2012 442000 people were charged with misdemeanors for openly displaying or burning 25 grams or less of pot.         I wasnåÛåªt sure about the weight of my stash åÛåÓ although a digital scale was used in the transaction I didnåÛåªt see the display åÛåÓ but it didnåÛåªt feel too heavy.         Still I wasnåÛåªt about to openly display or burn it.         IT turns out that there was little to fret over. While scores of people are arrested on these charges every day in New York the laws apparently donåÛåªt apply to middle-aged white guys.         Or at least they arenåÛåªt enforced against us.         åÛåÏIt is your age that would make you most unusual for an arreståÛå said Professor Harry Levine a Queens College sociologist who has documented marijuana arrests in New York and across the country. åÛåÏIf you were a 56-year-old white woman you might get to be the first such weed bust ever in New York City åÛåÓ except possibly for a mentally ill person.åÛå         About  87 percent of the marijuana arrests in the Bloomberg era have been of blacks and Latinos  most of them men and generally under the age of 25 åÛåÓ although surveys consistently show that whites are more likely to use it.         These drug busts were the No. 1 harvest of the cityåÛåªs stop question and frisk policing from 2009 through 2012  according to a report  released Thursday by the New York State attorney general Eric T. Schneiderman. Marijuana possession was the most common charge of those arrested during those stops. The few whites and Asians arrested on these charges were 50 percent more likely than blacks to have the case åÛåÏadjourned in contemplation of dismissalåÛå the report showed.         Now having a little bit of pot like a joint is not a crime as long as you donåÛåªt burn or openly display it. Having it in my backpack was a violation of law meaning that it is an offense that is lower than a misdemeanor. Pot in the backpack is approximately the same as making an illegal turn in a car. Taking it out and waving it in the face of a police officer or lighting up a joint on the street would drive it up to the lowest-level misdemeanor.         How was it that all the black and Latino males were displaying or burning pot where it could be seen by the police?         The answer is that many of them were asked during the stops to empty their pockets. What had been a concealed joint and the merest violation of the law was transformed into a misdemeanor by being åÛåÏopenly displayed.åÛå If these were illegal searches åÛåÓ and they very well could have been åÛåÓ good luck trying to prove it.         LAST year the Bronx Defenders which represents poor people in criminal court tried to have suppression hearings in 54 cases involving marijuana possession. In such hearings the police officer would have been required to testify about the circumstances under which the marijuana was found. If it was the result of an illegal search the judge could have barred the use of the evidence.         But not once did the hearings go forward: missing paperwork officeråÛåªs day off the drip drip of wasted time. On average each case required five court appearances and stretched over eight months. Most of the charges were dropped or lowered to noncriminal violations.         The process itself was the punishment and it was inflicted almost exclusively on blacks and Latinos.         Michael A. Cardozo the chief lawyer for the city is eager to get an appeals court to throw out the findings of fact by a judge who ruled against the city in a lawsuit over the  stop-and-frisk  tactics. Mr. Cardozo appears to believe mistakenly that losing a lawsuit is going to damage the legacy of his patron Mayor Bloomberg.         Undoing a lawsuit will not unstain this history.         As for me the pot got to a couple of people who might need it to get through some medical storms. ItåÛåªs too risky for me to use: I already have a hard enough time keeping my backpack zipped.

Their fighter the Russian heavyweight Magomed Abdusalamov remained in a medically induced coma at Roosevelt Hospital across the street.         åÛåÏOne week ago the doctors say he has 100 percent chance to dieåÛå his manager Boris Grinberg said 10 days after Abdusalamov entered the ring. Since then his condition has improved and there is talk of bringing him out of the coma his representatives said.         Abdusalamov fought Mike Perez at the Theater at Madison Square Garden on Nov. 2. He expected a tough bout perhaps even a bloody one the kind of televised fight that could propel him to greater heights.         The fight lasted 10 rounds and Abdusalamov took the worst of the exchanges. Blood dripped from his nose and from cuts above his left eyelid. He fought most of the match with a broken hand. He kept asking his team in Russian how his face looked.         His promoter Sampson Lewkowicz said in the diner that he considered trying to stop the fight in the eighth round. Security stopped him.         After the fight sportswriters and promoters gathered at a nearby bar and recounted the match. I was among them. The consensus: great action-packed fight.         At around the same time Abdusalamov left the arena and vomited on the curb. A cab dropped Abdusalamov at the hospital. Doctors asked his brother to sign off on surgery. Abdusalamov they said had a half-hour to live.         A brain scan showed swelling and a blood clot. Doctors induced a coma and removed a portion of his skull. While in the coma Abdusalamov had a stroke.         His family set up in the intensive-care unit where they have remained since. His brother slept on two chairs pushed together in a corner. His wife flew up from Florida with their three daughters ages 8 4 and 11 months. åÛåÏDa-DaåÛå the youngest kept saying.         AbdusalamovåÛåªs manager described him as a quiet man åÛåÏalways thinking about his future about his goals.åÛå He added åÛåÏHe is dying to be champion of the world.åÛå         During the fight I sat 10 feet from the boxers in the first row of the news media section. I saw AbdusalamovåÛåªs face swollen and disfigured. What a warrior I thought. What a fight.         In the weeks since I have wrestled with questions over why we cover this brutal sport in which so many combatants end up dead or neurologically impaired.         Bernard Hopkins a boxer known as The Executioner talked it over with me. He discussed the opportunities boxing offered the prospect for the kind of fortune and fame that he had enjoyed. He elaborated on the risks involved and gladiatorial sacrifice made for the entertainment of others. He could not explain to an outsider why boxers box or why a Russian heavyweight lay unconscious in a Manhattan hospital. But he tried.         Hopkins remembered visiting a fellow boxer Leavander Johnson as he lay in a coma after emergency brain surgery after a title fight gone wrong. Hopkins stood on one side of the bed. Oscar De La Hoya a man Hopkins once leveled with a devastating body blow stood on the other. They prayed and when they lifted their heads their eyes met.         åÛåÏManåÛå Hopkins said he told De La Hoya åÛåÏsee what we put our bodies through.åÛå         Johnson died and yet neither man considered retirement. Hopkins 48 fought last month.         Boxing Hopkins says saved his life.         åÛåÏI donåÛåªt expect you to understandåÛå he said. åÛåÏI mean how many people go to work and say literally say åÛå÷I might die tonight.åÛåª But thatåÛåªs boxing. Whenever thereåÛåªs a fight thereåÛåªs a possibility of death.åÛå         Hopkins could not explain why boxers box but since they do he wants to help.         He tells fighters to take out insurance above what promoters are required to by commissions which varies from state to state. He says that networks and promoters should take 3 percent of the gross revenue for televised and pay-per-view events and start a fund for boxers who incur severe injuries or worse.

Liz Cheney 47 was criticized on Facebook on Sunday by her sister Mary 44 who is a lesbian and objects to LizåÛåªs opposition to same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney and her wife Heather Poe have suggested that Liz has always been supportive of their relationship and have questioned how she can do so while publicly opposing same-sex marriage.         But Mr. Cheney and his wife appear to be siding with Liz and said in the statement that it is possible to be loving toward a lesbian sister and her spouse while not embracing the idea of their marrying.         åÛåÏThis is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years and we are pained to see it become publicåÛå the parentsåÛåª statement said. åÛåÏSince it has one thing should be clear: Liz has always believed in the traditional definition of marriage. She has also always treated her sister and her sisteråÛåªs family with love and respect exactly as she should have done. Compassion is called for even when there is disagreement about such a fundamental matter and LizåÛåªs many kindnesses shouldnåÛåªt be used to distort her position.åÛå         Mr. Cheney is heavily involved in his older daughteråÛåªs bid for the United States Senate seat in Wyoming and has been helping her to raise money for the race. The Cheneys appear eager to prevent the family feud from becoming an issue in the race.         The sisters have not spoken since the summer and Mary Cheney  told The New York Times  on Sunday that she would not reconcile with Liz unless she changed her position on marriage.         Mary Cheney has kept up her advocacy on her Facebook page responding sharply to one commenter on the page who urged her to be åÛåÏlovingly tolerantåÛå of her sisteråÛåªs position on same-sex marriage.         åÛåÏThis isnåÛåªt like a disagreement over grazing fees or what to do about IranåÛå Mary Cheney wrote. åÛåÏThere isnåÛåªt a lot of gray here. Either you think all families should be treated equally or you donåÛåªt. LizåÛåªs position is to treat my family as second class citizens. ThatåÛåªs not a position I can be åÛåªlovingly tolerantåÛåª towards.åÛå

A number of federal officials told a Senate hearing that such financial networks offered real benefits for the financial system even as they acknowledged that new forms of digital money had provided avenues for money laundering and illegal activity.  ‰ÛÏThere are plenty of opportunities for digital currencies to operate within existing laws and regulations‰Û said Edward Lowery a special agent with the Secret Service which is tasked with protecting the integrity of the dollar. Signs that the government would not stand in the way of bitcoin‰Ûªs development even as it has been cracking down on criminal networks that use the digital money stoked a strong rally in the price of the crypto-currency. By Monday evening the value of a bitcoin unit soared past $700 on some exchanges.

The Senate hearing Monday afternoon was the clearest indication yet of the government‰Ûªs desire to grapple with the consequences of this growth and the recognition that bitcoin and other similar networks could become more lasting and significant parts of the financial landscape.

How on earth the companies asked did the N.S.A. get their data without their knowing about it?         The most likely answer is a modern spin on a century-old eavesdropping tradition.         People knowledgeable about Google and YahooåÛåªs infrastructure say they believe that government spies bypassed the big Internet companies and hit them at a weak spot åÛåÓ the fiber-optic cables that connect data centers around the world and are owned by companies like Verizon Communications the BT Group the Vodafone Group and Level 3 Communications. In particular fingers have been pointed at Level 3 the worldåÛåªs largest so-called Internet backbone provider whose cables are used by Google and Yahoo.         The Internet companiesåÛåª data centers are locked down with full-time security and state-of-the-art surveillance including heat sensors and iris scanners. But between the data centers åÛåÓ on Level 3åÛåªs fiber-optic cables that connected those massive computer farms åÛåÓ information was unencrypted and an easier target for government intercept efforts according to three people with knowledge of GoogleåÛåªs and YahooåÛåªs systems who spoke on the condition of anonymity.         It is impossible to say for certain how the N.S.A. managed to get Google and YahooåÛåªs data without the companiesåÛåª knowledge. But both companies in response to concerns over those vulnerabilities recently said they were now encrypting data that runs on the cables between their data centers. Microsoft is considering a similar move.         åÛåÏEveryone was so focused on the N.S.A. secretly getting access to the front door that there was an assumption they werenåÛåªt going behind the companiesåÛåª backs and tapping data through the back door tooåÛå said Kevin Werbach an associate professor at the Wharton School.         Data transmission lines have a long history of being tapped.         As far back as the days of the telegraph spy agencies have located their operations in proximity to communications companies. Indeed before the advent of the Internet the N.S.A. and its predecessors for decades operated listening posts next to the long-distance lines of phone companies to monitor all international voice traffic.         Beginning in the 1960s a spy operation  code-named Echelon  targeted the Soviet Union and its alliesåÛåª voice fax and data traffic via satellite microwave and fiber-optic cables.         In the 1990s the emergence of the Internet both complicated the task of the intelligence agencies and presented powerful new spying opportunities based on the ability to process vast amounts of computer data.         In 2002 John M. Poindexter former national security adviser under President Ronald Reagan proposed the  Total Information Awareness plan  an effort to scan the worldåÛåªs electronic information åÛåÓ including phone calls emails and financial and travel records. That effort was scrapped in 2003 after a public outcry over potential privacy violations.         The technologies Mr. Poindexter proposed are similar to what became reality years later in N.S.A. surveillance programs like Prism  and Bullrun .         The Internet effectively mingled domestic and international communications erasing the bright line that had been erected to protect against domestic surveillance. Although the Internet is designed to be a highly decentralized system in practice a small group of backbone providers carry almost all of the networkåÛåªs data.         The consequences of the centralization and its value for surveillance was revealed in 2006 by Mark Klein an AT&T technician who described an N.S.A. listening post inside a room at an AT&T switching facility.         The agency was capturing a copy of all the data passing over the telecommunications links and then filtering it in AT&T facilities that housed systems that were able to filter data packets at high speed.         Documents taken by Edward J. Snowden and  reported by The Washington Post  indicate that seven years after Mr. Klein first described the N.S.A.'s surveillance technologies they have been refined and modernized.

John Koskinen a 74-year-old lawyer with little tax experience chosen by Obama to take over the beleaguered IRS traveled up to Capitol Hill to face the Senate Finance Committee but the session did not last long.         Koskinen gave an opening statement and took two questions from lawmakers. Then Democratic Senator Max Baucus committee chairman called a halt to the hearing citing a procedural time limit on hearings.         The time limit is typically waived but was invoked by a Republican senator on Tuesday according to one Republican Finance Committee aide.         The identity of the lawmaker who invoked the rule was not disclosed and his or her reasons for doing so were unclear aides said.         The hearing was rescheduled for 9:15 a.m. (1415 GMT) Wednesday.         Before the session's abrupt end Koskinen told the panel he would work to restore public trust in the IRS and called on Congress to stop cutting the tax agency's budget.         The committee had been expected to vote in favor of Koskinen's nomination before the end of the year and to send it to the full Senate for consideration lobbyists said.         Called out of retirement to take on a tough job Koskinen said he was ""excited"" to be IRS commissioner but acknowledged a daunting list of problems awaits him. He said the next commissioner must rebuild the agency's tarnished image.         A political uproar engulfed the IRS after a senior agency executive apologized publicly in May for unfairly subjecting conservative political groups seeking tax-exempt status to extra time-consuming scrutiny.         The controversy that ensued cost the acting head of the IRS his job triggered multiple investigations and badly damaged the agency's reputation for political impartiality.         PUBLIC TRUST AS IRS ASSET         ""Taxpayers need to be confident that they will be treated fairly no matter what their background or their affiliations"" Koskinen said his opening remarks. ""Public trust is the IRS's most important and valuable asset.""         The Obama administration proposed new rules last month to rein in the political activity of tax-exempt social welfare groups of the sort that were at the heart of the IRS crisis.         Orrin Hatch the committee's top Republican pressed Koskinen to widen those proposed rules to include tax-exempt business groups and labor unions. Koskinen said he will ""actively participate"" in the review of public comments submitted to the IRS on the rules.         Looking to the 2014 tax season starting early next year Koskinen said customer service may suffer from funding cutbacks.         The IRS will have 11000 fewer people working on filings next year but is expected to process the largest number of returns ever he said. The IRS has about 95000 employees.         ""We need to solve the funding problem"" Koskinen said.         If confirmed Koskinen would serve a five-year term. He would replace Danny Werfel who was appointed acting IRS commissioner by Obama in May.         Werfel a former White House budget official will be leaving the IRS at the end of the year Baucus said at the hearing. ""I hope we can approve (Koskinen's) nomination quickly and take it to the full Senate for a vote"" he said.

Twice in 2011 cars failed to navigate the exit slamming into a pair of shops. A third careered onto the sidewalk in front stopped only by scaffolding erected to fix the earlier damage.         Yet despite efforts by New York City to slow traffic and protect pedestrians another vehicle ended up sideways against one of the storefronts early on Tuesday. The driver an off-duty police officer alone in the car around 2 a.m. was thrown from the silver 2004 Ford Focus and died.         Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly called the crash a åÛåÏtragedy.åÛå He said the 36-year-old officer Elisa Toro was a 10-year veteran who worked in Manhattan lived in the Bronx and had two teenage sons. She was not wearing a seatbelt the police said.         For local elected officials and people who live and work in the area the crash was not surprising another sign that the spot remained treacherous and sometimes deadly.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs a little nerve-rackingåÛå said Patrick Rivera 32 who works at a check-cashing business next door to the smashed-up storefront a former beauty salon where the car came to rest. Next to the salon along Queens Plaza South had been a Caribbean restaurant which was also damaged in 2011. Both shops have been vacant since the earlier crashes.         As part of a large-scale redesign of the plaza that created bike lanes widened sidewalks and a park the cityåÛåªs Transportation Department changed the way cars exited the bridge forcing them to merge at a sharper angle onto Queens Plaza South which runs parallel to the bridge.         Soon after in March 2011 a driver traveling too fast lost control seriously injuring himself and a passenger and fatally striking a pedestrian. That driver Grant Norman James Riddell had been intoxicated and driving without a license the authorities said; he is awaiting trial on charges stemming from the crash.         Less than two weeks after that crash  another car  followed the same trajectory. The driver who the authorities said was unlicensed at the time was injured and the passenger was killed.         Both accidents occurred around 4 a.m. The city later installed a concrete barrier at the spot to keep cars from again ending up on the sidewalk.         åÛåÏIf one location has several fatalities in the same spot clearly that is an emergencyåÛå said Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer who represents the neighborhood. åÛåÏThey need to be studying this again.åÛå         As it did in 2011 the Transportation Department on Tuesday pointed to the thousands of drivers who safely exit the bridge there. Seth Solomonow a spokesman said there had been numerous measures taken to warn drivers to slow down including three signs warning drivers to go 20 miles per hour yellow and white reflectors rumble strips and åÛåÏan electronic sign that displays the speed of passing motorists.åÛå         On Tuesday the concrete barrier appeared cracked at spots with black skid marks. The department did not provide the number of crashes at that location since 2011.         Mr. Van Bramer said he had requested statistics from the department to no avail. åÛåÏI think theyåÛåªre a little defensive about this locationåÛå he said.         Several lawsuits have been filed against the city and the engineering company that redesigned the roadway said Scott E. Agulnick a lawyer representing the two businesses that closed because of the crashes. The restaurantåÛåªs owner is trying to restart elsewhere in the city.         The man who owned the beauty salon left for Houston last year. åÛåÏHe and his wife invested a lot into that business and it was open a little less than six months when this happenedåÛå Mr. Agulnick said.         At a deli next door the crash rekindled fears among customers and workers. åÛåÏFour times itåÛåªs missed this placeåÛå said Crystal Shah 25 a clerk at the deli. åÛåÏWeåÛåªve been lucky. What if our luck runs out?åÛå         Ron Shapiro who owns the check-cashing business on the other side of the now-vacant shops said he believed the danger remained confined to early hours of the morning when traffic was light and fast. åÛåÏIt canåÛåªt really happen during the dayåÛå he said. åÛåÏYou try speeding across Queensboro Bridge in the afternoon thereåÛåªs too much traffic. You might get up to four miles an hour.åÛå

The same trend has recently been documented among gay men in Canada Britain the Netherlands France and Australia heightening concerns among public health officials worldwide.         According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the number of men who told federal health investigators that they had had unprotected anal sex in the last year rose nearly 20 percent from 2005 to 2011. In the 2011 survey unprotected sex was more than twice as common among men who said they did not know whether they were infected with H.I.V.         Being tested even once for H.I.V. is associated with men taking fewer risks whether the test is positive or negative health experts say. But the most recent survey found that a third of the men interviewed had not been tested in the past year.         The findings are worrying because åÛåÏunprotected anal intercourse is in a league of its own as far as risk is concernedåÛå Dr. Thomas R. Frieden director of the disease centers said on Wednesday as the figures were released.         The data published in the agencyåÛåªs  Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report  do not explain why unprotected sex has risen so rapidly but a leading hypothesis Dr. Frieden said is that more men are åÛåÏsero-sortingåÛå åÛåÓ that is those who are uninfected (åÛåÏH.I.V. seronegativeåÛå on lab reports) try to sleep only with other men who are uninfected or who hope they are or who merely promise they are.         åÛåÏThe problem with sero-sorting is that itåÛåªs really easy to get it wrongåÛå Dr. Frieden said. åÛåÏWhen one-third of men arenåÛåªt even tested in the last year and a tenth of those who thought they were negative were actually positive you donåÛåªt want to risk your life on a guess.åÛå         Other hypotheses say Dr. Frieden and Dr. Jonathan Mermin the disease centersåÛåª director of H.I.V. prevention are that many young men have never known anyone dying of AIDS and so do not fear it or that they believe that they can easily stay on antiretroviral drugs for life.         Two leading independent AIDS researchers agreed only partly with those explanations.         åÛåÏYoung guys are less worriedåÛå said Alex Carballo-DiÌÄå©guez a researcher at the H.I.V. Center of the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University who has studied gay menåÛåªs behavior since the 1980s. åÛåÏH.I.V. has become a chronic disease and everyone knows some behaviors are bad for you like smoking and trans fats. But in the moment of excitement theyåÛåªre going to do what they enjoy.åÛå         Perry N. Halkitis a researcher at New York University who has been in the field for 20 years and has repeatedly surveyed a cohort of 600 young gay men for the last five years åÛåÓ all of whom were uninfected when the study began åÛåÓ says young men still fear getting the disease.         He attributes the rise of unprotected sex to two factors.         First recent  studies  have shown that people who take their antiretroviral drugs daily are very unlikely to transmit disease so uninfected men think it is relatively safe to sleep with them. A problem with that line of thinking however is that not all men on the drugs take them every day. Second he said the collapse of the economy over the last six years has put many young men out of work åÛåÏand we see higher-risk behavior when people have more risk in their lives.åÛå         The C.D.C. suggests that sexually active gay men be tested at least annually many doctors treating gay patients suggest intervals as short as three to six months and many adult film producers now require that actors be tested every two weeks.         Since 2005 the disease centers have been conducting the National H.I.V. Behavioral Surveillance System survey every three years in 20 cities mostly in gay bars but also in parks and on streets in gay neighborhoods. The agency concedes that it probably undercounts some high-risk groups including prisoners teenagers too young or poor to go to bars and men who keep their homosexuality secret.         Surveys have consistently found infection rates highest among young black gay men even though they were more likely than their white counterparts to use condoms. The chief reason for that experts say is that most people have sex within their own ethnic groups and older black gay men have very high rates of undiagnosed and untreated H.I.V.         The survey is the only large national one of its kind but a similar survey begun in San Francisco in 1997 showed a rise in unprotected sex from 1998 through 2008 Dr. Mermin said.         The number of new H.I.V. infections in the United States has been stuck at roughly 50000 a year for many years although public health officials are trying to bring it down. Among the factors working against them: The United States population is growing and infected men are living longer and staying sexually active thanks to antiretroviral drugs.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs like what the Red Queen said to Alice: åÛå÷You have to run faster and faster to stay in the same placeåÛåªÌâåÊåÛå Dr. Frieden said. åÛåÏWhen you go from one million infected to 1.2 million you have to do better and better just to stay steady.åÛå         The goal of the national AIDS strategy put in place by the Obama administration in 2010 is to have new infections down to roughly 38000 a year by 2015. åÛåÏWhether that will be reached only time will tellåÛå Dr. Frieden said.

Germany's eight major ship financiers have lent a total of 105 billion euros to the sector a fifth of which are categorized as non-performing Moody's said in a report.         ""We expect the extended downward shipping cycle to cause rising problem loans in the shipping sector during 2013-14 requiring German banks to increase their loan-loss provisions. This will challenge their earnings power"" the agency said.         Moody's findings chime with those of peer Fitch which said late in November that it expects losses from shipping portfolios to remain high in 2014 particularly for German banks.         Moody's identified DVB Bank HSH Nordbank KfW IPEX-Bank NordLB and its subsidiary Bremer Landesbank as the most vulnerable banks.         Problems with shipping loans will see banks' combined capital decreased by 13 percent until maturity of these loans further weakening the lenders' financial health.         Moody's calculated only 30 percent of the problem shipping loans of its total sample were covered by loan-loss provisions. ""(This) is likely to prove insufficient"" it said.         A European bank health check may trigger additional provisioning as loans benefiting from remediation measures - such as covenant waivers or an extension of repayment schedules - may be re-classified as problem loans under the new standard of the European Banking Authority the ratings agency said.

These directives which oppose abortions inevitably collide with a hospitalåÛåªs duty to provide care to pregnant women in medical distress. This tension lies at the heart of a federal lawsuit  filed last week  by the American Civil Liberties Union.          The suit  was brought on behalf of a Michigan woman Tamesha Means who says she was subjected to substandard care at a Catholic hospital åÛåÓ the only hospital in her county åÛåÓ after her water broke at 18 weeks of pregnancy. Doctors in such circumstances typically induce labor or surgically remove the fetus to reduce the womanåÛåªs chances of infection. But according to the complaint doctors acting in accordance with the bishopsåÛåª directives did not inform Ms. Means that her fetus had virtually no chance of surviving or that terminating her pregnancy was the safest treatment option.         Despite acute pain and bleeding Ms. Means was sent home twice and when she returned a third time with a fever from her untreated infection she miscarried even as the paperwork was being prepared to discharge her again. The fetus died soon after.         The case has gained attention because Ms. Means is not suing the hospital for medical negligence but the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The A.C.L.U. is arguing on her behalf that having issued the mandates and made them conditions of hospital affiliation the conference is responsible for åÛåÏthe unnecessary trauma and harmåÛå that Ms. Means and åÛåÏother pregnant women in similar situations have experienced at Catholic-sponsored hospitals.åÛå         How the suit will play out is unclear but it showcases an important issue. Catholic hospitals account for about 15 percent of the nationåÛåªs hospital beds and in many communities are the only hospital facilities available. Allowing religious doctrine to prevail over the need for competent emergency care and a womanåÛåªs right to complete and accurate information about her condition and treatment choices violates medical ethics and existing law.         The problem Ms. Means encountered is not unique or limited to her particular medical needs. In 2010 the Diocese of Phoenix punished a nun and stripped a hospital of its affiliation after doctors there performed an abortion to save a motheråÛåªs life.         In a statement last Friday the president of the bishopsåÛåª group Archbishop Joseph Kurtz  said  that the religious directives did not encourage or require substandard medical treatment. He also portrayed the case as an attack on religious freedom åÛåÓ the same unpersuasive argument the bishops are making against the new federal health care lawåÛåªs requirement that all plans include contraception coverage.         The bishops are free to worship as they choose and advocate for their beliefs. But those beliefs should not shield the bishops from legal accountability when church-affiliated hospitals following their rules cause patients harm.

And some anxious investors who withdrew much more than they put into their Madoff accounts are facing lawsuits that seek to reclaim profits that unknown to them were paid with stolen money.          Irving Picard  the court-appointed trustee liquidating the Madoff estate in federal bankruptcy court is suing to åÛåÏclaw backåÛå those paper profits so he can redistribute them to victims who lost actual principal by investing directly with Mr. Madoff. So far Mr. Picard has recovered $9.5 billion and has distributed $4.8 billion of that. He hopes to raise more for eligible victims through thousands of lawsuits that are inching their way through the courts.         These eligible victims can expect to collect at least 54 cents for every dollar they gave Mr. Madoff. But they represent only 15 percent of 16000 Madoff-related claims. (Each claim could represent hundreds or even thousands of investors.)         Most of the investors åÛåÓ including those who lost cash through an intermediary åÛåÓ will receive much less if anything and some may even be required to pay money to the trustee. Provided that they incurred a cash loss they may be eligible for a separate $2.35 billion fund set up by the Justice Department financed through civil settlements and the sale of assets seized in Madoff-related criminal cases. But that process has just begun.         Some victims meanwhile are edging into the light recovering some savings however slowly and rebuilding satisfying if simpler lives. In recent interviews a sample of Madoff investors cited some common lessons that emerged from their differing struggles: Diversify your savings. Focus on what really matters. And donåÛåªt give up or give in to rage or frustration.          Beyond the Country Club   Burt and Joanne Meerow have told the story often enough that they can now laugh a little about the absurdity of the situation: They were in a doctoråÛåªs office JoanneåÛåªs jeans around her knees as she waited for a cortisone shot in her hip. Burt who had come with her to the appointment took a call on his cellphone listened for a moment and suddenly began crying out in panic åÛåÏI have no money I have no money.åÛå         Bernie Madoff had been arrested. About 80 percent of their wealth invested just a few years earlier through a money-management unit at a major insurance company was gone. Mrs. Meerow drove her distraught husband to their home in Park Ridge N.J. went into the bathroom and threw up.         Today the Meerows åÛåÓ he is 75 she is 66 åÛåÓ have settled into a new life in West Dover Vt.         åÛåÏWhen your life gets altered overnight you realize you donåÛåªt have to keep doing everything youåÛåªve been doingåÛå Mr. Meerow said. åÛåÏYou donåÛåªt need to belong to a country club or drive an expensive car or buy expensive jewelry. You certainly donåÛåªt have to own three separate dwelling places. It was all pretty obvious.åÛå         Mr. Meerow the sole breadwinner retired in 2004 after selling his consumer testing business placing the proceeds with a Madoff-linked fund he had heard about at his country club. The couple had planned a comfortable  retirement  with skiing in Vermont golf in Florida and frequent visits to their children and grandchildren in New York City.         After Mr. MadoffåÛåªs arrest they promptly sold their New Jersey home for a good price. They unloaded a Florida golf-club condominium at a loss but no longer had to pay the costly monthly fees. They sold their share of a ski home in Vermont and bought a smaller home nearby in a community where they have friendships extending back many decades.

Unfortunately we are now struggling having been home for 5 days.åÛå    åÛåÏPrayerfully seeking a loving and nurturing family for our 14-year-old daughter who has been with us for almost a year. She honestly is almost a model child.åÛå   This is åÛåÏprivate re-homingåÛå something that once meant finding a new home for a dog that barked too much. Now it refers to families recycling their adopted children often through Internet postings.         There are commonly no courts involved no lawyers no social service agencies and no vetting of the new parents. ThereåÛåªs less formality than the transfer of a car.         Private re-homing of adoptive children was explored in  a devastating five-part investigative series this fall from Reuters . The reporters found that on one Yahoo message board a child was offered for re-homing on average once a week (Yahoo has since closed the board). Most of the children ranged in age from 6 to 14 and had been adopted abroad but some were American-born.         When one troubled Russian girl was 12 years old she was re-homed three times within six months and told Reuters that by the time she was 13 a boy at one of the homes had sex with her åÛåÓ and then urinated on her.         A Chinese girl crippled by polio ended up in a home where a woman with an explosive temper was eventually overseeing 18 children. The girl says that the woman confiscated her leg brace which she needed to walk. And according to court records the woman as a form of punishment once ordered her to dig a hole in the backyard åÛåÓ for her own grave.         åÛåÏYou die here and no one will knowåÛå the Chinese girl quoted the woman as saying. åÛåÏNo one will find you.åÛå         The families handing over the children are at witåÛåªs end. They typically adopted children with serious emotional troubles who they say brought fear chaos and sometimes violence to their homes. Parents of one adopted boy said they felt they had to lock him in his room every night for the safety of everyone else.         åÛåÏI am totally ashamed to say it but we do truly hate this boyåÛå one woman in Nebraska wrote about her 11-year-old adoptive son from Guatemala.         Another mother wrote of re-homing her 12-year-old daughter: åÛåÏI would have given her away to a serial killer I was so desperate.åÛå         By some accounts 10 percent to 25 percent of adoptions donåÛåªt work out. That could mean 24000 foreign-born children are no longer with the families that adopted them Reuters calculates.         When an adopted child is American he or she can go into the foster care system. With foreign adoptions it can be harder. State foster care systems are more reluctant to take custody of children from international adoptions and giving a child to the authorities may entail an investigation for abuse or paying for the childåÛåªs care until new parents are found.         For those who take in re-homed children it amounts to free adoption saving many thousands of dollars. A dangerous pitfall is that because there is often no screening to protect the vulnerable children re-homing can lure pedophiles.         The heart of the Reuters investigation concerns a woman Nicole Eason who lost custody of her own two children after one suffered broken bones and who was the last to see a friendåÛåªs baby alive before he drowned in a bathtub. Eason acquired six children through re-homing on the Internet.         Meanwhile EasonåÛåªs former housemate Randy Winslow used the screen name åÛåÏlovethemcuteåÛå on one pedophile site on the Internet Reuters says. Before being arrested and convicted on child pornography charges Winslow explained his thinking in one chat room: åÛåÏjust have to raise them to think itåÛåªs fine and not tell anyone.åÛå He added: åÛåÏwhat is done in the family stays in the family.åÛå         Eason contacted an adoptive mother one morning and Eason and Winslow took custody of her 10-year-old son that same day in a hotel parking lot.         A first step to address this issue would be to make adoption agencies responsible for children they bring to America including finding new homes when adoptions fail. If we have rules about recycling bottles we should prevent children from being abandoned and recycled.         The larger point is a more basic failing in America: inadequate child services. Kids donåÛåªt get the protection they need from predators nor the nutrition they need nor  the books and reading programs they need  for mental nutrition. The  threat to the food stamp program  whose beneficiaries are 45 percent children is emblematic of this broader problem. Children donåÛåªt have votes and are voiceless so AmericaåÛåªs most vulnerable become its most neglected.

But those remarks just a month ago by  Lululemon Athletica åÛåªs founder Dennis J. Wilson caused an uproar and capped a troubled year for the retailer as Mr. Wilson tried to explain problems with a sizable costly recall of yoga pants.         Two days before the company was to report its third-quarter earnings  Lululemon  announced on Tuesday that he would step down from his position as chairman of the board of directors although he remains on the board. Michael Casey the lead director will replace him as chairman and Laurent Potdevin who was most recently the president of TOMS Shoes was named to take over as chief executive from Christine Day who announced in June that she would be resigning.         A Canadian company that sells workout clothing like sports bras jackets and yoga pants that are generally considered high quality and on the more expensive side Lululemon has enjoyed considerable growth åÛåÓ with revenue rising to $1.4 billion in the year ending last February. But it has faced stiffening competition in the category of athletic apparel whose popularity is evident in the fields of stretchy fabrics now found at places like the Gap and elsewhere.         Although the companyåÛåªs stock price shot up during Ms. DayåÛåªs tenure from about $15 a share in 2008 to about $82 before her announcement it then dropped after a shareholdersåÛåª lawsuit contended that the company was concealing problems with those yoga pants.         Made of a fabric known as Luon the pants which made up 17 percent of the retaileråÛåªs bottoms for women  were discovered to be too sheer . But that was not learned until the pants were in stores and the costly recall caused the retailer considerable embarrassment.         At the time Ms. Day said that åÛåÏthe truth of the matter is that the only way that you can actually test for the issue is to put the pants on and bend over.åÛå         And some months later in November as the company was trying to recover an interview Mr. Wilson who is known as Chip gave to Bloomberg Television revived the controversy and seemed to make it worse. In response to a question about LululemonåÛåªs pants which were said to pill quickly Mr. Wilson said ÌâåÊåÛåÏsome womenåÛåªs bodies just actually donåÛåªt workåÛå for yoga pants. The pilling he said was åÛåÏreally about the rubbing through the thighs how much pressure is there.åÛå         His comments ricocheted around the web were the target of ridicule and prompted him to issue a taped apology which apparently failed to quell some worries that the companyåÛåªs reputation had faltered.         åÛåÏSo much of what consumers say is now heard by a companyåÛåªs leadershipåÛå said Marshal Cohen chief industry analyst at the NPD Group a retail research company. åÛåÏIn the past who was I going to complain to my best friend? Big deal. Now a complaint can become viral.åÛå         Mr. Casey in an interview said that while the Lululemon founder would continue to be a presence he was not a åÛåÏspokesmanåÛå for the company. åÛåÏChip is the founder of Lululemon and thatåÛåªs certainly not going to changeåÛå he said.         He added that Mr. Wilson would continue the company mission against åÛåÏmediocrity.åÛå         In 2011 the company made headlines with shopping bags emblazoned with åÛåÏWho is John Galt?åÛå The slogan is the opening line of RandåÛåªs novel åÛåÏAtlas ShruggedåÛå which espouses free market capitalism and individualism.         And in 2007 the year Lululemon became a public company The New York Times  commissioned a laboratory test  of a shirt made of VitaSea a fabric that the company said was made with seaweed. The fabric åÛåÏreleases marine amino acids minerals and vitamins into the skin upon contact with moistureåÛå the product labels said.         But in fact the shirts were made of cotton. No evidence of seaweed was found in that test or in others.         åÛåÏIf you actually put it on and wear it it is different from cottonåÛå Mr. Wilson said when told of the results. åÛåÏThatåÛåªs my only test of it.åÛå         As far as how the retail company would move forward under new management a few analysts questioned the choice of Mr. Potdevin who began his career at LVMH and was chief executive of Burton Snowboards from 2005 to 2010.         Sam Poser an analyst at Sterne Agee said that Mr. PotdevinåÛåªs background was in operations not in retailing. Ms. Day he said åÛåÏhad great instincts on the retail side and not-as-great instincts on the operations side. I think they hired somebody who is almost the opposite.åÛå         And even as Lululemon tried to pitch the conversation into its next phase much of the initial response to its busy day of news centered on the past remarks of its departing chairman.         åÛåÏWe view WilsonåÛåªs departure as chairman as a positiveåÛå Faye Landes an analyst at Cowen and Company said in a report to investors åÛåÏbecause he is obviously considered something of a loose cannon.åÛå         On Tuesday the stock opened at $71.83 and closed at $69.12.

This advice wasnåÛåªt exactly solicited. And inasmuch as it gave detractors of Obama and Obamacare a fresh cudgel it wasnåÛåªt terribly helpful either.         But Bill will be Bill. ThatåÛåªs one way to view his latest post-presidential intervention: as the impromptu utterance of a man whose mind is always racing whose mouth is often running and who doesnåÛåªt mind the microphones and the spotlight. There was an opening for his perspective an appetite.  He filled it .         You can alternately view what he said as payback. HeåÛåªs no doubt aware of a widely publicized nugget from the new book åÛåÏDouble Down: Game Change 2012åÛå which reports that Obama finds him a tad insufferable the guest who overstays his welcome and has said that heåÛåªs best savored  åÛåÏin doses.åÛå  So he gave Obama a dose all right. It was more vinegar than honey with just the slightest trace of arsenic.         Or you can view what happened last week in grandly strategic and utterly gallant terms which is where things really get interesting and which may be the most accurate appraisal of all. Clinton is looking to 2016 and heåÛåªs helping Hillary. ItåÛåªs less dicey for him than for her to second-guess Obama which could wind up being a prerequisite to succeeding him. His presidency at this particular moment looks more and more like one of those unlucky Florida homes perched unsuspectingly over a sinkhole. Soon only the top of the chimney will be visible.         And making sure that Obamacare  does  get fixed and that a majority of Americans three years from now are at peace with it could have as much bearing on HillaryåÛåªs ambitions as on ObamaåÛåªs legacy. Voters wonåÛåªt rush to elect a Democratic president if the health care reforms that the party promoted so assiduously go bust.         What an unusual political spectacle we have before us and what an amazing one could be ahead.         For starters thereåÛåªs Clinton himself an ex-president in excelsis his stride brisker his footprint larger and his etiquette looser than those of other Oval Office alumni. HeåÛåªs more ubiquitous more loquacious not just an  åÛåÏexplainer in chiefåÛå  as he was called after his sprawling remarks at the 2012 Democratic convention but a belittler in waiting emitting so many words on so many fronts that a few are bound to sting. Last June he questioned ObamaåÛåªs deference to public-opinion surveys that showed weak support for military intervention in Syria and said that a president who hesitates for such reasons risks looking like  åÛåÏa total fool.åÛå   In his animation and expansiveness heåÛåªs a sustained retort to ObamaåÛåªs style. Obama right now is enduring the news-media ordeal of every president whose agenda has gone off-track with each facet of his personality examined and tagged as the cause. HeåÛåªs aloof heåÛåªs cold heåÛåªs a loner.         Clinton is the ever-present antonym of all of that bringing ObamaåÛåªs peculiarities and liabilities into relief. As I watched ObamaåÛåªs stiff apology on Thursday åÛåÓ åÛåÏI completely get how upsetting this can be for a lot of AmericansåÛå he said with a listlessness that suggested that he completely wanted to get far away from the podium åÛåÓ I couldnåÛåªt help imagining ClintonåÛåªs hypothetical performance in a similar spot and bind. He would have been lavish with empathy promiscuous with it. He would have bled and he would have gushed.         In commenting on current events he no longer has to be as restrained as he was during ObamaåÛåªs first four years when Hillary was the secretary of state. Bill doing his own globe-trotting could easily have said something to trip her up or bring her grief. To the astonishment of many Democrats well familiar with his past recklessness he didnåÛåªt.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs amazing to me that he caused her no problemsåÛå one longtime Democratic political operative remarked to me last week. åÛåÏThat was a thoughtful daily exercise in discipline.åÛå         åÛåÏHeåÛåªs disciplined when he  wants  to beåÛå a Democratic strategist who has worked with him told me. This observation bolstered the theory that the Syria dig and last weekåÛåªs Obamacare riff werenåÛåªt accidental at least not entirely and that ClintonåÛåªs comments about Obama can be read as those of HillaryåÛåªs proxy establishing any necessary distance between what Obama is doing and how a different Democratic president åÛåÓ for example  her  åÛåÓ might handle things.         åÛåÏYou canåÛåªt over-interpret itåÛå the strategist cautioned saying that even a couple as conniving as the Clintons canåÛåªt and donåÛåªt åÛåÏsit there at the chessboard every day.åÛå         But HillaryåÛåªs possible candidacy is always åÛåÏin his subconsciousåÛå the strategist added referring to Bill. åÛåÏHeåÛåªs always aware that heåÛåªs got this project which is getting her elected president if thatåÛåªs what she wants.åÛå         He was an effective tireless cheerleader for Obama during the 2012 campaign an effort in line with what he surely deemed best for the country. But it may have been best for Hillary in 2016 too. Had Obama lost the Democratic nominee in the coming presidential election would be facing a Republican incumbent. Besides Bill deftly kindled Clinton nostalgia reminding people of a more prosperous era.         But the calculus for him over the coming years is much much more complicated. If Obama doesnåÛåªt recover if there are more fumbles and if Hillary formally decides that sheåÛåªd like to carry the ball next BillåÛåªs best approach may be cheerleading mingled with fault finding and the current president may be faced with a former president whose tangle of motives is unlike any that other former presidents possessed.         At the same time Bill canåÛåªt be too vocal too vivid. Exposure has risks evident in his divisive  remarks  about the South Carolina primary that Hillary lost to Obama in 2008.         And in precisely the way that he sometimes makes Obama seem tepid he could outshine Hillary inadvertently or not. A friend of mine who went to a public event of hers last week was blown away by how  not  blown away he was. Amid all of the Hillary hullabaloo heåÛåªd forgotten that sheåÛåªs no dynamo on the stump. Many Democrats overlook this but not the ones whispering sweet encouragements in Elizabeth WarrenåÛåªs ear. Part of what they see in Warren åÛåÓ and part of what they believe could make her a spoiler åÛåÓ is a sizzle that doesnåÛåªt come as naturally to Hillary.         Back to Bill. To pay his sizable debt to his wife to pave his own return to the White House heåÛåªd have to pull off a balancing act like none in the history of helpmeets. You have to hand it to the Clintons. Never a dull moment.

After all this quiet town near the Idaho border founded by Mormon pioneers had a longstanding ban on alcohol sales. And in keeping with the tenets of the Mormon Church few people in Hyde Park drank at all.         But this month after a long and bitter battle residents voted nearly two to one to allow alcohol sales making Hyde Park one of the last bastions to loosen its rules on drinking in this button-down state where liquor laws have grown less restrictive in recent years.         åÛåÏThis was the most emotional issue IåÛåªve seen in Hyde ParkåÛå said Bryan Cox the mayor who supported overturning the ban. åÛåÏPeople were passionate on this one way or the other.åÛå         Alcohol has had a quirky complicated history in Utah as lawmakers have had to consider the powerful influence of the Mormon Church which frowns upon drinking.         From the end of Prohibition until the late 1960s bar patrons had to bring their own bottles or store them in tavern lockers. Those laws eventually gave way to a system that required people to pay for a club membership to order drinks.         The hospitality industry continued to push steadily to ease regulations. In 2009 state lawmakers joined with Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. to eliminate the membership requirement allowing bars to serve any patron of legal age.         Still vestiges of UtahåÛåªs rigidity remain. Restaurants can now serve wine beer and liquor but most drinks must be prepared behind a partition that has come to be known as the åÛåÏZion Curtain.åÛå         The question of whether to allow beer sales in Hyde Park unmasked painful divisions. Neighbors argued over what it meant to be Mormon. Some emphasized the economic benefits of alcohol sales. Others stayed quiet afraid they would be ostracized for weighing in.         The debate started simmering last year after the City Council voted 3 to 2 to allow the Maverik convenience store åÛåÓ the only such store in town åÛåÓ to sell beer. But some wanted Hyde ParkåÛåªs 3900 residents to have a say. Opponents of alcohol sales gathered enough signatures to put the ban to a citywide referendum before the new ordinance took effect.         At heated public hearings proponents of selling beer said fliers that were placed in peopleåÛåªs mailboxes implied that drinkers were undesirable. Those against the sales said their campaign signs had been stolen or vandalized.         Kathy Reck who helped lead the opposition campaign said she worried that selling alcohol would lead to public health troubles.         Ms. Reck who has an administrative job at nearby Utah State University said opponents feared being criticized as too devout. The Mormon Church known formally as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches members not to drink and has supported UtahåÛåªs strict regulations.         åÛåÏI think people were afraid that if they spoke out about how they truly believed they would be persecuted as if it was a religious issueåÛå she said. åÛåÏI thought I was moving into this wonderful L.D.S. community where everyone would stand up and speak. IåÛåªve been a little disillusioned.åÛå         For many allowing the sales represented an economic boon to this city of wide sycamore-lined streets at the base of the Wasatch mountain range. Besides Maverik Hyde Park has few retail businesses.         Bret Randall a city councilman said that even if most residents abstained from drinking Hyde Park should not force others to do the same.         åÛåÏBeing a member of the Latter-day Saints I understand the arguments against itåÛå said Mr. Randall who is a police lieutenant in neighboring Logan where alcohol is sold.         Mr. Randall said he had witnessed the effects of alcohol abuse firsthand through his job.         åÛåÏBut IåÛåªm also a huge advocate of free agencyåÛå he said. åÛåÏYouåÛåªre an adult and you have choices. Although I donåÛåªt use alcohol or advocate for its use I certainly understand peopleåÛåªs right to drink.åÛå         Mr. RandallåÛåªs stance has become more commonplace as the state seeks to balance religious tradition with economic and social realities.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs been a lot easier for people from outside of Utah to get a drink without going through the restrictions of a private membershipåÛå said John Valentine a state senator from Utah County who helped draft the 2009 law that removed the membership requirement. åÛåÏIf they just want a drink they can go get a drink.åÛå         In addition to bars liquor stores operated by the state sell alcohol in Utah. But as in some other states convenience stores like Maverik can sell only low-alcohol beer.         Danielle Mattiussi the executive director of regional operations for the Maverik chain said she expected overall sales at its Hyde Park store to increase by about 25 percent.         åÛåÏWeåÛåªre looking forward to selling beeråÛå she said. åÛåÏWeåÛåªve been a part of this community for over 20 years.åÛå         Hard feelings may linger. Some residents expressed disappointment that their community was changing; others said drinkers had been unfairly derided.         But residents vowed to put aside their differences. Hyde Park is a place where you cannot avoid your neighbors åÛåÓ in town public meetings or church.         Last week with the new ordinance in effect the city presented Maverik with its alcohol license. A large banner flapped from the storeåÛåªs entrance.         åÛåÏThank you Hyde ParkåÛå it read.

Hrdy  surveyed the research literature  three decades ago she concluded that åÛåÏthe competitive component in the nature of women remains anecdotal intuitively sensed but not confirmed by science.åÛå         Science has come a long way since then as Dr. Hrdy notes in her introduction to a recent issue of  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society  devoted entirely to the topic of female aggression. She credits the åÛåÏstunningåÛå amount of new evidence partly to better research techniques and partly to the entry of so many women into scientific fields once dominated by men.         The existence of female competition may seem obvious to anyone who has been in a high-school cafeteria or a singles bar but analyzing it has been difficult because it tends be more subtle and indirect (and a lot less violent) than the male variety. Now that researchers have been looking more closely they say that this åÛåÏintrasexual competitionåÛå is the most important factor explaining the pressures that young women feel to meet standards of sexual conduct and physical appearance.         The old doubts about female competitiveness derived partly from an evolutionary analysis of the reproductive odds in ancient  polygynous  societies in which some men were left single because dominant males had multiple wives. So men had to compete to have a chance of reproducing whereas virtually all women were assured of it.         But even in those societies women were not passive trophies for victorious males. They had their own incentives to compete with one another for more desirable partners and more resources for their children. And now that most people live in monogamous societies most women face the same odds as men. In fact they face tougher odds in some places like the many college campuses with more women than men.         To see how female students react to a rival researchers brought pairs of them into a laboratory at McMaster University for what was ostensibly a discussion about female friendships. But the real experiment began when another young woman entered the room asking where to find one of the researchers.         This woman had been chosen by the researchers  Tracy Vaillancourt  and Aanchal Sharma because she åÛåÏembodied qualities considered attractive from an evolutionary perspectiveåÛå meaning a åÛåÏlow waist-to-hip ratio clear skin large breasts.åÛå Sometimes she wore a T-shirt and jeans other times a tightfitting low-cut blouse and short skirt.         In jeans she  attracted little notice and no negative comments from the students  whose reactions were being secretly recorded during the encounter and after the woman left the room. But when she wore the other outfit virtually all the students reacted with hostility.         They stared at her looked her up and down rolled their eyes and sometimes showed outright anger. One asked her in disgust åÛåÏWhat the [expletive] is that?åÛå         Most of the aggression though happened after she left the room. Then the students laughed about her and impugned her motives. One student suggested that she dressed that way in order to have sex with a professor. Another said that her breasts åÛåÏwere about to pop out.åÛå         The results of the experiment jibe with evidence that this åÛåÏmean girlåÛå form of indirect aggression is used more by adolescents and young women than by older women who have less incentive to handicap rivals once they marry. Other studies have shown that the more attractive an adolescent girl or woman is the more likely she is to become  a target for indirect aggression from her female peers .         åÛåÏWomen are indeed very capable of aggressing against others especially women they perceive as rivalsåÛå said Dr. Vaillancourt now a psychologist at the University of Ottawa. åÛåÏThe research also shows that suppression of female sexuality is by women not necessarily by men.åÛå         Stigmatizing female promiscuity åÛåÓ a.k.a. slut-shaming åÛåÓ has often been blamed on men who have a Darwinian incentive to discourage their spouses from straying. But they also have a Darwinian incentive to encourage other women to be promiscuous. Dr. Vaillancourt said the experiment and other research suggest  the stigma is enforced mainly by women .         åÛåÏSex is coveted by menåÛå she said. åÛåÏAccordingly women limit access as a way of maintaining advantage in the negotiation of this resource. Women who make sex too readily available compromise the power-holding position of the group which is why many women are particularly intolerant of women who are or seem to be promiscuous.åÛå         Indirect aggression can take a psychological toll on women who are ostracized or feel pressured to meet impossible standards like the vogue of thin bodies in many modern societies. Studies have shown that womenåÛåªs ideal body shape is to be thinner than average åÛåÓ and thinner than what men consider the ideal shape to be. This pressure is frequently blamed on the ultrathin female role models featured in magazines and on television but Christopher J. Ferguson and other researchers say that itåÛåªs mainly  the result of competition with their peers not media images .         åÛåÏTo a large degree the media reflects trends that are going on in society not creates themåÛå said  Dr. Ferguson  a psychologist at Stetson University. He found that womenåÛåªs dissatisfaction with their bodies  did not correlate with what they watched on television  at home. Nor were they influenced by TV programs shown in laboratory experiments: Watching the svelte actresses on åÛåÏScrubsåÛå induced no more feelings of inferiority than watching the not-so-svelte star of åÛåÏRoseanne.åÛå         But he found that women were more likely to feel worse when they compared themselves with peers in their own social circles or even if they were in a room with a thin stranger like the assistant to Dr. Ferguson who ran  an experiment  with female college students. When she wore makeup and sleek business attire the students were less satisfied with their own bodies than when she wore baggy sweats and no makeup. And they felt still worse when there was an attractive man in the room with her.         åÛåÏSexual competition among females seems to increase due to circumstances that tend to be particularly common in affluent societiesåÛå Dr. Ferguson said.         In traditional villages people married at an early age to someone nearby but young men and women in modern societies are free to postpone marriage as they search long and far for better options. The result is more competition because there are so many more rivals åÛåÓ and thereåÛåªs no longer any scientific doubt that both sexes are in to win it.

The tipping point for Rodriguez apparently came early in the day when the arbitrator hearing his case Fredric Horowitz decided not to order Bud Selig the commissioner of baseball to testify in the proceedings. åÛåÏThe absurdity and injustice just became too muchåÛå Rodriguez said in a statement. åÛåÏI walked out and will not participate any further in this farce.åÛå         Baseball responded with its own statement: åÛåÏFor more than 40 years Major League Baseball and the players association have had a contractual grievance process to address disputes between the two parties. This negotiated process has served players and clubs well. Despite Mr. Rodriguez being upset with one of the arbitration panelåÛåªs rulings today Major League Baseball remains committed to this process and to a fair resolution of the pending dispute.åÛå         The developments Wednesday were the latest chapter in the bitter and bizarre dispute between baseball and Rodriguez the YankeesåÛåª third baseman. On Aug. 5 Selig suspended Rodriguez for 211 games saying that he had obtained performance-enhancing drugs from Biogenesis of America a South Florida anti-aging clinic and that he had obstructed baseballåÛåªs investigation into the clinic.         It now seems that the case will extend well beyond the arbitratoråÛåªs eventual decision and will probably wind up in the court system where Rodriguez has already sued Major League Baseball and Selig. The hearing was expected to continue Thursday without Rodriguez and Horowitz could rule on the appeal of his suspension by the end of the year.         Until Wednesday Rodriguez had been a fixture at Major League Baseball headquarters in Manhattan during his hearing which began Sept. 30 and has continued since then with two recesses.         The arbitration which is not open to the public reconvened Monday with lawyers for Rodriguez presenting their side of the case. RodriguezåÛåªs representatives had planned to call a lengthy list of witnesses including Selig and Randy Levine the president of the Yankees.         Levine testified Tuesday and denied that the Yankees who owe Rodriguez $86 million on his contract had pushed Major League Baseball to punish him.         Later in the week RodriguezåÛåªs lawyers said they planned to call Selig and Rodriguez to testify. But Horowitz the arbitrator apparently felt that the testimony of Robert Manfred a senior executive for Major League Baseball who oversaw the case was sufficient and he decided Selig would not face questioning.         Upset with the decision Rodriguez stormed out of the room accompanied by one of his lawyers and blurting a profane remark at Manfred as he departed according to people briefed on the matter.         Rodriguez quickly issued a statement through his publicist saying Selig should have to take the stand to explain åÛåÏhis rationale for the unprecedented and totally baseless punishment he hit me with.åÛå         On WFAN Rodriguez said he had never imagined that Selig would not take the stand adding: åÛåÏThis should end with Selig on Thursday and me on Friday under oath. Put your money where your mouth is.åÛå         Rodriguez said during the interview that he felt the matter was åÛåÏ100 percentåÛå personal between him and Selig. Rodriguez added that Selig who plans to retire after next season was trying to build his legacy through a lengthy suspension. åÛåÏHe hates my gutsåÛå Rodriguez said adding that Selig does not like big salaries.         M.L.B. in a second statement it issued Wednesday noted that a commissioner had never testified in a case since the joint drug agreement had been established and added that RodriguezåÛåªs åÛåÏanticsåÛå in walking out of the hearing were åÛåÏan obvious attempt to justifyåÛå the fact that he had not testified himself.

This is how it is at a certain age; when you hear about an old boyfriend itåÛåªs not because he got married or got a great job it is because theyåÛåªre threading tubes into his chest and doing an ablation on his heart.         This toy which was silver and shaped like a stylized banana was so complicated I never used it. Also you had to charge it for a few hours. It wasnåÛåªt one of those things that charged with a discreet little light either; it blasted O-shaped strobe signals across a darkened room that could have been used to direct incoming flights at a small airport ideally one catering to businessmen whose wives had lost interest in sex years ago. Well thatåÛåªs what they all say isnåÛåªt it?         As I have a personal code that says you do not use a sex toy given to you by one man with another (yes I do have a Puritan streak) and disliking it anyway I had stashed this thing in a big closet which is like deep space things go there and disappear forever. The other day I heard Sandra Bullock in there hollering.         But now with the old beauåÛåªs surgery looming the toy åÛåÓ rather its disposal åÛåÓ was on my mind. This was a problem. It was not one of those unused household items you can donate to Housing Works; they donåÛåªt even take sheets. IåÛåªm an environmentally conscious person but I couldnåÛåªt see taking it to old electronics day at Union Square. I could put it into the appropriate recycling bin on my floor but then the neighbors might figure it out: ItåÛåªs her. All day all night I hear buzzing coming out of that apartment. No wonder sheåÛåªs always smiling. I might try to dispose of it with the kitchen garbage hiding it with coffee grounds and dead things from the back of the refrigerator as I do old tax reports but then IåÛåªd be in violation of the recycling law.         I know I know åÛåÓ I should have been one of those women who held out for diamonds.         But disposing of sex paraphernalia åÛåÓ actually all those embarrassing items you have stashed around the house åÛåÓ is something every boomer should be concerned about. The days are dwindling down to a precious few and some of you have a nasty cough. Do you want the people clearing out your house particularly your children to find those feathery metallic rubbery polymer blend items you ordered one drunken night a few months after youåÛåªd been forced to take early retirement? Do you want them to know their big tough construction worker dad liked to dress up in heels and a boa and sing åÛåÏLa La LaåÛå from åÛåÏNo StringsåÛå one of Richard RodgersåÛåªs weaker efforts?         You may be thinking åÛåÏWhat do I care what my friends or children find in the house? I will be beyond embarrassment I will be dead.åÛå But you are wrong. Doctors now know that the human sense of embarrassment can last up to two weeks after the heart stops beating. Consider this statement from a boomer named Stanley: åÛåÏI was lying on the operating table then I had a feeling of leaving my body and looking down at myself and all I could think was åÛå÷Is my gut really that big?åÛåª åÛå Look it up on the web.         I know no one likes to think about death. But just as the responsible person designates someone to make medical decisions in case he or she is incapacitated we should all have designated letåÛåªs call them Eradicators to come over and clean the house after we expire. Remember Marilyn Monroe. Not that I can prove anything just saying. Your Eradicator should be given house keys a list of items to be destroyed and their hiding places åÛåÓ you donåÛåªt want to be in intensive care screaming åÛåÏBack of the sock drawer!åÛå TheyåÛåªll just increase your meds.         The truly considerate person will dispose of potentially humiliating or harmful items the moment he gets really sick like a married man I knew who gave his love letters from the other woman to a male friend before he went into the hospital. Then he got better and got the love letters back. Then he died which was a big mistake on his part though I hear it made for an interesting moment at the memorial when the widow spotted the other woman. Think of this as a cautionary tale. Horrible things can happen when you leave romantic mementos around the house.         There is no excuse however for careless or improper disposal such as my friend Herb and I were witness to many years ago in Greenwich Village when we spied a sex toy in the street åÛåÓ not on the sidewalk in the street. IåÛåªd tell you what it was but I am trying to stay within newspaper guidelines: O.K. think adult seesaw.         Herb and I gaped long and hard at this thing first debating the anatomical possibilities (and you wonder what friends have to talk about after 40 years) then as in åÛåÏLaw & OrderåÛå trying to recreate the scene:         Had there been a loversåÛåª quarrel during which this humongous shillelagh had been tossed out of a cab? If that was the case why did the couple have the thing in the cab in the first place åÛåÓ stealing a kiss in the back seat is one thing but that? Had it slipped out of someoneåÛåªs shopping bag and then even in the Village was he or she too embarrassed to pick it up?         Awful right? And imagine how much worse it would have been if it had been spotted when I was walking with a child.         åÛåÏWhatåÛåªs that thing in the street Auntie Joyce?åÛå         åÛåÏItåÛåªs a grown-up thing sweetie. People buy them when they love each other very much. Or maybe not enough. One day when youåÛåªre grown up a man will fall in love with you. When that happens bring up diamonds.åÛå

All I can say is åÛåÏBravo!åÛå         At least if I were writing book reviews for BuzzFeed thatåÛåªs all I could say because at BuzzFeed there is no room in the literary criticism section for you know criticism. Finally in an online world of gratuitous snark one courageous editor has displayed the vision to give thumbs down to thumbs down. You read that right: no negative reviews.         åÛåÏWhy waste breath talking smack about something?åÛå the recently hired book editor Isaac Fitzgerald rhetorically wondered  in an interview with the Poynter Institute . åÛåÏYou see it in so many old media-type places the scathing takedown rip.åÛå         Yeah that. Not just the smart-aleck Gawker crowd åÛåÓ those too-cool-for-school types who think a potty-mouth crack-using mayor in Canada is somehow a natural object of ridicule åÛåÓ but the entire mob of vandals: Harold Bloom. Margaret Atwood. Umberto Eco. Don Rickles. Saddam Hussein. So superior the whole lot of them.         Anyway isnåÛåªt the Internet already a glut of negativity? (TMZ hello!) And by the way as long as weåÛåªre asking the tough questions here does Isaac Fitzgerald not totally rock?         Now look IåÛåªm no Pollyanna. I understand there are some stinkers out there. Just between you and me James PattersonåÛåªs latest didnåÛåªt have the usual sizzle. And recently I was quite put off by åÛåÏThe Protocols of the Elders of Zion.åÛå But what purpose is served by publicly finding fault with a volume that some author has worked very hard to produce when there are many many excellent books upon which to lavish praise?         Recently the reviewer Camilla Long of The Sunday Times of London won  TheOmnivore.com åÛåªs  tellingly named Hatchet Job of the Year Award for her savaging of Rachel CuskåÛåªs memoir of her marital breakup åÛåÏAftermath .åÛå In her review Ms. Long described the book as åÛåÏa needy neurotic mandolin soloåÛå written by åÛåÏa brittle little dominatrix and peerless narcissist.åÛå My question is what was gained by that petty sniping? Why embarrass poor Ms. Cusk and upset readers of The Sunday Times when Sheryl SandbergåÛåªs åÛåÏLean InåÛå was there for the reading?         The usual insufferable tweedwads argue that literary criticism is a genre unto itself its value residing not in the appraisal of the book so much as the context scholarship and thematic exploration offered by the critic. Uh-huh. Sure. Go ahead Margaret Atwood åÛåÓ make this about you.         The other silly argument is that a positive review is rendered meaningless if there is no possibility for a negative one. Oh really? Ever see a hyperlink?         LetåÛåªs say BuzzFeed reviewed åÛåÏAftermathåÛå in the manner of Camilla Long. LetåÛåªs further say the review åÛåÓ like other products featured in BuzzFeed åÛåÓ was helpfully linked to an online retailer such as Amazon.com which pays affiliate-marketing commissions to referring sites. LetåÛåªs say the review called the book åÛåÏa needy neurotic mandolin solo.åÛå         LetåÛåªs think about the click-through rate for that item: How much commission do you think the referrer åÛåÓ BuzzFeed in our hypothetical case åÛåÓ would earn for its brutal takedown of a book by åÛåÏa brittle little dominatrix?åÛå Actually donåÛåªt answer that question answer this one: How meaningless does a five-star review seem now?         But never mind the e-commerce business model. To my way of thinking BuzzFeedåÛåªs heroic initiative will succeed even if it merely eradicates the depressing negativity that has for so long kept literary criticism from becoming a full-fledged economic sector like agriculture transport and erectile dysfunction.         It also brings us one step closer to my two lifelong dreams: first a newspaper that delivers only good news; and second diet bacon.

A further 850000 will be denied benefits in the first quarter of 2014.         Congressional Democrats and the White House pointing to the sluggish recovery and the still-high jobless rate are pushing once again to extend the period covered by the unemployment insurance program. But with Congress still far from a budget deal and still struggling to find alternatives to the $1 trillion in long-term cuts known as sequestration lawmakers say the chances of an extension before Congress adjourns in two weeks are slim.         As a result one of the largest stimulus measures passed during the recession is likely to come to an end and jobless workers in many states are likely to receive considerably fewer weeks of benefits.         In all as many as 4.8 million people could be affected by expiring unemployment benefits through 2014 estimated Gene Sperling President ObamaåÛåªs top economic adviser.         åÛåÏHistorically there has not been a time where the unemployment rate has been this high where you have not extended itåÛå Mr. Sperling said in an interview. åÛåÏWhy would you not extend now when youåÛåªre dealing with the nearly unprecedented levels of long-term unemployment coming off such a historic recession? This would be the wrong time to do it.åÛå         Democrats are pushing for an extension of the emergency insurance program as part of the broader budget talks designed to avert  a repeat of the government shutdown  in October. But negotiators in the House and Senate are discussing a relatively small deal focused on replacing or altering the sequestration cuts which would probably not include an extension of the jobless program.         Both Republicans and Democrats are skeptical that even such a small deal is possible given how divided the parties are.         Senator Patty Murray Democrat of Washington and chairwoman of the Budget Committee åÛåÏclearly supports the policy is interested in doing it and is hopeful there will be a path in this budget conferenceåÛå said a senior Democratic aide with knowledge of the discussions. åÛåÏShe will continue to work with Republicans to see if itåÛåªs possible in this deal.åÛå         Republican aides declined to discuss the talks. But Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin the House budget chairman åÛåÏis committed to finding common groundåÛå said William Allison a spokesman. åÛåÏHe hopes both parties can work together to cut spending in a smarter way.åÛå         Congress initially created the federally funded unemployment insurance extension in 2008 as a way to combat poverty and to help unemployed workers get through the worst recession since  the Great Depression . Congress has repeatedly extended the program since then with the Congressional Budget Office calling it among the most effective  forms of government stimulus .         But with each extension legislators have haggled over the programåÛåªs cost and over how many weeks of benefits the government should provide. Extending the current program through 2014 would cost about $25 billion. The program has cost  roughly $250 billion  so far.         The end of the emergency program would come as the economy is improving if slowly. Employers are now adding jobs at a pace of around 200000 a month and the  unemployment rate has dropped  to 7.3 percent.         But weakness persists beyond the headline numbers. About four million Americans have been looking for work for more than six months and the share of the working-age population with a job has declined over the past year.         In part that is because the government has slashed spending even as private businesses have picked up their hiring. Sequestration forced federal agencies to enact sudden budget cuts this year. And a number of recession-era programs beyond the emergency jobless aid program are ending. This month for example an expansion of the food stamp program expired.         The left-of-center Economic Policy Institute  has estimated  that the expiration of the emergency jobless benefits program would reduce job growth by 310000 positions next year because consumers over all would have less money to spend. Michael Feroli chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase  has estimated  that it would drain about four-tenths of a percentage point from first-quarter economic growth.         Already about 2.5 million unemployed people who have not worked in six months or more are receiving no federal jobless benefits.         Those include Jonathan Galliher a 31-year-old computer programmer in Chicago who is living with family and freelancing while searching for a full-time job. åÛåÏFor a long time I felt like I didnåÛåªt have any momentumåÛå he said. åÛåÏIt has been difficult. I spend my days sitting at home working and not really seeing a lot of other people. That kind of isolation is not good for people.åÛå         The odds of finding a job once out of work for a long spell are slim åÛåÓ about 1 in 10 during any given month. That has spurred hundreds of thousands of workers to simply drop out of the labor force with  long-lasting economic consequences  for those workers and for the country.         åÛåÏWhen I go for an interview and I get asked åÛå÷What have you been doing for the last four years?åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå said Nancy Copeland 56 who lives in Kansas City Kan. and is looking for a job in medical billing. åÛåÏIåÛåªm made to feel like itåÛåªs the Sunday night before a term paper is due IåÛåªve known about it for months and I just started on it Wednesday afternoon and now my mom is asking me why I waited so long.åÛå

Different styles regions and grapes all have their moments in the marketing spotlight although the rationales for these sudden blasts of commercial heat can vary wildly.         Sometimes it comes unexpectedly. A pop song shouts out Moscato dåÛåªAsti and before you can say åÛåÏSweet fizzy pleasant and forgettableåÛå people are buying it and flaunting it around the world. More often critical efforts to promote the virtues of a particular wine intersect with rising audience receptivity and voilÌÄåÊ rosÌÄå© is dominating summer as it has now for much of a decade.         RosÌÄå© is a mass-market fashion a Britney Spears sort of wine. But fashion operates in wineåÛåªs geekier spheres as well. Certainly the passion for wines of the Jura in certain circles is heartfelt but no doubt some have adopted the wines for what they connote as much as for whatåÛåªs in the bottle.         For a perfect and oh-so-seasonally appropriate example of geeky wine fashion look no further than extra-brut Champagnes.         What are extra-brut Champagnes? As you may know fermenting grapes into still wine is only the first step in producing Champagne. The Champagne producer then selects a blend of still wines and bottles it with a dollop of sugar and yeast. The yeast goes to work beginning a second fermentation that produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct which trapped in the bottle turns into bubbles. The winemaker then opens the bottle to disgorge the yeast sediment and finally adds a sweet solution or dosage before corking and shipping the bottle.         The dosage (doh-SAHJ if you want to be French about it) is usually a blend of wine and sugar syrup or concentrated grape juice intended to balance out the Champagne which may otherwise be highly acidic and severely dry. This dosage accounts for the final level of sweetness in the bottle which is designated by terms like åÛåÏbrutåÛå (the vast majority of Champagnes) the paradoxically sweeter åÛåÏextra dryåÛå the sweeter yet åÛåÏsecåÛå and the dessert-level åÛåÏdemi-secåÛå and åÛåÏdoux.åÛå         Technically speaking brut Champagnes can range up to 12 grams of residual sugar per liter. Thirty years ago most brut Champagnes sold in the United States were at the higher end of this range. Whatever lip service Americans paid to dry wine they preferred a sweet roundness in their Champagnes. For years in fact one of the most popular Champagnes sold in the United States MoÌÄåÇt White Star was not even a brut but a sweeter extra dry.         But as Americans became more accustomed to drinking wine they began to prefer dryer styles as did many people around the world. For years now mass-market Champagne producers have been reducing the sweetness levels of their wines. In 2012 MoÌÄåÇt stopped selling White Star in the United States replacing it as its flagship Champagne with ImpÌÄå©rial a brut.         Most fascinating of all has been the rise of low-dosage Champagnes those made with less than six grams of residual sugar. These can be labeled extra brut and if the dosage is three grams or less they can also be labeled åÛåÏbrut natureåÛå åÛåÏbrut zÌÄå©roåÛå or åÛåÏnon-dosÌÄå©.åÛå What even 10 years ago was barely a fringe style is now the height of Champagne fashion.         For a deeper understanding of these Champagnes the wine panel recently tasted 20 nonvintage low-dosage or no-dosage bottles. For the tasting I was joined by Jordan Salcito beverage director of the Momofuku restaurants and Laura Maniec proprietor of Corkbuzz Wine Studio in Greenwich Village. Florence Fabricant was away.         The reasons for the growing popularity of these styles seem clear. Aside from a more knowledgeable audience the biggest trend in Champagne since 2000 has been the rise of the grower-producers. These small farmers who produce their own Champagnes offered a welcome contrast and counterbalance to the biggest houses whose mass-market wines dominated sales. They still do. But where some of the biggest houses had become complacent more focused on marketing than on quality the grower-producers reminded the world that Champagne was a wine an agricultural product rather than an urban luxury good.

Barra who was named the next chief executive of General Motors on Tuesday visited The New York Times in November and talked with reporters and editors. What follows is an edited condensed version of the interview.    Q.  Can you talk about your career in a male-dominated industry and how have things changed?          A.  I started at General Motors at 18 years old as a co-op student at the General Motors Institute which is now  Kettering . My father was a die maker for 39 years so I had a basic understanding of the automobile industry and what the manufacturing world was like just from the opportunity to spend time with him åÛåÓ just talking because he was a car buff.         Things have changed dramatically. When I started back in 1980 at 18 years old the factory was a different place than it is right now. But åÛåÓ not that it was completely impossible then åÛåÓ I just think it has become more welcoming. There are women in every aspect of the business.         You start with our board. We were just recognized for having a very high percentage of women board members.         And then you look at the women who sit at the top level of the company at the executive committee. We have several women whether it is Alicia Boler-Davis myself Melissa Howell åÛåÓ all members of that. So I think there are more women in more senior roles than in 1980 when I started. But from my career perspective I donåÛåªt go into a room and take count. I want to be recognized for my contribution and for what I do. Yeah there were probably times it was to my benefit and there were probably times when it was not to my benefit. But that is true for everyone. There are always things that potentially impact how you are received. And I just donåÛåªt focus on it. I donåÛåªt focus on what you canåÛåªt control.          Q.  When did things change?          A.  Through my whole career I have seen more and more women. ItåÛåªs been a decade where we have had many women plant managers. When I started in 1980 that was probably something that wasnåÛåªt necessarily even comprehended. And maybe 15 or 20 years later there were many women across the country and across the globe in leadership roles running operations. Which is a really core experience.         I donåÛåªt know if there was a moment where I said itåÛåªs really different now. Because I would say that through my career IåÛåªm very fortunate. I have worked for a lot of really great leaders and mentors that I felt provided me along with many of my peers åÛåÓ many of them women åÛåÓ opportunities.          Q.  Would you want Daniel AkersonåÛåªs job?          A.  I have the best job in the company right now. I am responsible for designing building and selling. I spend time with the design staff and Ed Welburn. Spending time in design and looking at the future åÛåÓ what can be åÛåÓ and having a strong influence in that to quite often on Friday afternoons we spend time at the Milford Proving Ground or when I am around the globe at other proving grounds and driving vehicles åÛåÓ from Korea to Brazil to Europe to Milford åÛåÓ itåÛåªs a pretty good job.          Q.  How much travel do you do? How do you split time?          A.  Eight to nine major trips a year overseas. I try to be as efficient as I can because I am a mom with two teenagers. And then a lot of smaller overnight trips.         When I am there at our global product development centers I am meeting with the design team and reviewing design work being done there and meeting with engineers responsible for work being done specific to that region meeting with purchasing team.          Q.  What do you drive?          A.  I drive a lot of things. ThatåÛåªs one of the benefits of the job.         The new CTS I really love it.         The Corvette is just a great car to drive. If you can do an old-to-new comparison you will see itåÛåªs just been taken a step further. You have this great sports car but still it is true to the Chevrolet brand because it is a great value. Yes it is a $50000 car but it is competing against cars approaching two times that so it is true to ChevyåÛåªs heritage for value and ingenuity åÛåÓ the work that was done the learnings from the racetrack that were driven into that vehicle.         The Impala. ItåÛåªs a car I am really proud of. I really love the Spark BEV.         So I drive them all.          Q.  Do you miss your old Chevette?          A.  Well that was a car I could afford and thanks to my parentsåÛåª help. It was my first car and my dad was a die maker so he did get a benefit from being a General Motors employee. But I had the most basic of basic cars.         It actually was an automatic. My manual was a Fiero. I worked at the Fiero plant.         But I still remember the Chevette vividly because it gave me freedom. It was our way to spend more time with our friends. They have that now all the time. I have two teenagers a 14- and a 16-year-old.         My son couldnåÛåªt wait to drive. ItåÛåªs not that the millennials do not want vehicles.          Q.  Do you have any classics?          A.  My husband has been on a two- or three-year hunt for the perfect Camaro. We have owned different cars but right at this point in time I donåÛåªt. I canåÛåªt tell you how many different Camaros we have looked at. A couple of times we have just been slow to move åÛåÓ the values go pretty quickly.         We are kind of åÛåÓ if you ask me what my all-time favorite is I am a Camaro fan. Or a Firebird.         Looking for a åÛåª67 to åÛåª69 a convertible.         We have owned every generation. We have a Camaro SS right now. I canåÛåªt really claim it is my husbandåÛåªs car. There are a couple in the future that we are looking at buying as they come out.         There is an active debate going on right now.          Q.  Is your husband a G.M. employee as well?          A.  Actually no. We met at General Motors Institute so he is an engineer as well. But he is actually a consultant. That is probably best.

Who says math has to be boring?         åĞåÊ My students most of whom just donåÛåªt seem interested in learning anything much less calculus.         åĞåÊ Some of my fellow math teachers who assign pages of boring math equations to solve and give weekly exams.         åĞåÊ Administrators in my school who are themselves convinced that theyåÛåªre åÛåÏno good at math.åÛå         åĞåÊ Textbook writers with their endless seemingly useless rote problems to solve.         åĞåÊ Random people I meet who usually tell me how much they hate math when I tell them what I do.         Mathematics is the language of the cosmos and the basic human thirst for knowledge led to the discovery of its beauty and connectedness to everything around us. Therefore it is certainly not the math that is boring but the way we present it to students.         First we should abandon textbooks and tests in the classroom and replace them with project-based curriculums. Second letåÛåªs create a national catalog of interesting engaging projects for teachers to choose from. And finally educational leaders must help to create a culture of learning in our schools so that we can end the vicious cycle of assuming that åÛåÏmath has to be boring.åÛå         SETH BLUM

The focus is often on whether sex can kill you by precipitating a heart attack. Happily these studies generally show that heart rates rise during intercourse but tolerably. In a 2008 study middle-aged subjects‰Ûª heart rates jumped at the point of orgasm by only 21 beats per minute in men and 19 in women about the same response as if they‰Ûªd just done a few jumping jacks. The risk for sex-related cardiac arrest is in fact vanishingly small statistics show though it may be greater when the act is extramarital. The issue of sex as exercise however has remained largely unexplored. ‰ÛÏThere are these myths‰Û including that sex burns at least 100 calories per session said Antony D. Karelis a professor of exercise science at the University of Quebec at Montreal who undertook a study  published in PLOS One in October  to look at how much energy is actually exerted during sex. ‰ÛÏBut nobody had tested‰Û those assumptions. To do so Karelis and his colleagues recruited 21 young heterosexual committed couples from the local area and had them jog on treadmills for 30 minutes while researchers monitored their energy expenditure and other metrics in order to provide a comparison for the physical demands of sex. The scientists next gave their volunteers unobtrusive armband activity monitors that gauge exertion in terms of calories and METs or metabolic equivalent of task a physiological measure comparing an activity to sitting perfectly still which is a 1-MET task. Then the scientists sent the couples home instructing them to complete at least one sex act a week for a month while wearing the armbands and to fill out questionnaires about how each session made them feel physically and psychologically especially compared with running on the treadmill. When the researchers analyzed all of the resulting data it was clear Karelis said that sex qualified as ‰ÛÏmoderate exercise‰Û a 6-MET activity for men and 5.6-MET activity for women. That‰Ûªs the equivalent according to various estimates of playing doubles tennis or walking uphill. The jogging by comparison was more strenuous an 8.5-MET activity for the men in the study and 8.4 for women. (Though some men according to their activity monitors used more energy for brief periods during sex than they did jogging.) The sex also burned four calories per minute for men and three per minute for women during sessions that ranged from 10 to 57 minutes including foreplay. (The average was 25 minutes.) Men burned about 9 calories per minute jogging and women about 7. Over all the data reveal that ‰ÛÏsex can be considered at times a significant exercise‰Û Karelis said worth encouraging in people who otherwise balk at working out. Ninety-eight percent of Karelis‰Ûªs volunteers reported that sex felt more fun than jogging. The other 2 percent I suspect will be back in the dating market soon.    Tara Parker-Pope on living well.

But these are more than just hangers-on. They are also newcomers in a downtown art scene carved out by Mr. McGinley.         ThereåÛåªs  Petra Collins  20 who curates a womenåÛåªs art collective called the Ardorous; photographs for Tavi GevinsonåÛåªs online magazine Rookie and designs extremely graphic T-shirts.         ThereåÛåªs  Sandy Kim  27 a taboo-breaking photographer known for nudes and bodily fluids who hosted parties at the recently closed East Village bar Heathers and shoots for Purple and Vice magazines.         And thereåÛåªs  Chad Moore  26 who came to New York as a BMX-riding extreme sports guy and now has two books of his own photography shows at the Lodge Gallery on the Lower East Side and has shot for Coca-Cola and Creatures of the Wind.         They have all apprenticed for Mr. McGinley and are now living a kind of bohemian archetype of what itåÛåªs like to be young supremely talented and scene makers.         It is a story line that Mr. McGinley knows well. Back in the early 2000s he was at the center of a hard-partying crew of artists most prominently Dan Colen and the  late Dash Snow  who created a new myth of the downtown artist. Now 36 the former enfant terrible parties a little less (Mr. McGinley no longer drinks) and has matured into an improbable dean to the next generation of scrappy artists with his Chinatown studio serving as a de facto clubhouse.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs an educationåÛå Mr. McGinley said recently in his studio a tin-roofed loft on Canal Street that he originally shared with Mr. Colen. Surrounded by a hive of stylish assistants Mr. McGinley sat in an anteroom that serves as his primary work space still looking boyish in a white T-shirt and leather motorcycle jacket.         åÛåÏIn a way itåÛåªs a curriculum as I can give people advice because IåÛåªve been through itåÛå he said.         åÛåÏI was the first person to get attention within my crew and I wanted people to share the success that I was enjoying.         åÛåÏThereåÛåªs no manual for being an artiståÛå he added.         As Mr. McGinley tells it he did not set out to become a role model. He just wanted to keep the party going partly because his band of merry pranksters inhabits the same waiflike world that his photography captures.         ThatåÛåªs how he met Ms. Collins earlier this year: the two were dancing at  the Beaver  a raucous bar in Toronto when they were introduced. åÛåÏHeåÛåªs a really great dancer and I am too I like to thinkåÛå Ms. Collins said. They exchanged numbers and the next day Mr. McGinley happened to stop by a student art show curated by Ms. Collins and others at the Ontario College of Art and Design called åÛåÏPeriod Piece: The Gynolandscape.åÛå         åÛåÏI got a text from him with a selfie he took in front of a piece he wanted to purchaseåÛå said Ms. Collins a lithe woman with deep penetrating gray-green eyes and blond hair that curls into ringlets.         Mr. McGinley invited her to come along as a model on a road trip. She said yes immediately and they became fast friends as they traveled through West Virginia and Georgia shooting in tree houses and mucky swamps. åÛåÏHeåÛåªs kind of like the big brother I never hadåÛå she said. åÛåÏThere is just such a realness you get from him that is so rare to find in people.åÛå         Ms. Kim the photographer met Mr. McGinley at the 2010 Pitchfork Music Festival where she was tagging along with her boyfriend Colby Hewitt then the drummer for the band Smith Westerns. They were introduced backstage and bonded over the allure of photographing rock stars. (Christopher Owens the former lead singer of Girls is a favorite subject of Mr. McGinleyåÛåªs.) Soon after McGinley began dropping Ms. KimåÛåªs name to friends and in interviews.         åÛåÏFor a while he was telling everyone I was his favorite photographer which shined a lot of light on meåÛå said Ms. Kim who has since had solo gallery shows in New York San Francisco and Tokyo. åÛåÏHeåÛåªs very supportive of young artists and will always push for the ones who he believes in.åÛå

Perhaps their chief source of comfort is that the Obamacare mess hit the headlines at about the same time as the crack-smoking mayor of Toronto. At least the president didnåÛåªt claim he was drunk when he wrote the health care bill.         Obama obviously not a guy who enjoys self-abasement has been on an apology tour. He sat down with NBC News and said he was sorry that people whose health insurance plans were canceled åÛåÏare finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me.åÛå         While far from emotionally satisfying this did rise a tad above the classic blame-the-victim apology. (See football player Richie Incognito on his racist phone call to a black teammate: åÛåÏ... IåÛåªd apologize to his family. They took it as malicious. I never meant it that way.åÛå)         The chaos surrounding the rollout of health care reform is a terrible blow to people whoåÛåªve been standing behind the president through thin and thin. They had already come to grips with the fact that the guy who once taught constitutional law wasnåÛåªt going to protect their privacy from government snoops. That their old peace candidate really loved the idea of shooting people down with drones. That he was probably never going to be able to deliver on serious immigration reform or gun control or even expanded preschool.         But there was still affordable health care a goal that had been eluding presidents since Teddy Roosevelt which had required so many breathtaking leaps of political faith to pass and protect. One achievement so big it was pretty much enough.         And then the website didnåÛåªt work and longstanding promises were broken and the whole thing was turning into a joke on the Country Music Association Awards.         åÛåÏI think itåÛåªs fair to say that the rollout has been rough so faråÛå the president said at the start of his press conference on Thursday.         I think itåÛåªs fair to say that is an understatement.         Obama also acknowledged that when Americans had problems with the website åÛåÏthatåÛåªs on us not on them.åÛå Later when he began taking questions from reporters and got into full-throttle apology mode he offered up six versions of åÛåÏThatåÛåªs on usåÛå along with more wordy variations. (åÛåÏ... Ultimately IåÛåªm the president of the United States and they expect me to do something about it.åÛå)         Taking responsibility is extremely popular in these circumstances. It makes you appear to be strong while stating the obvious. If all of Washington had not been eaten by zombies at the beginning of the movie åÛåÏWorld War ZåÛå the president could easily have gone on TV and told the nation: åÛåÏUndead mutants are flooding the planet. Our troops are hitting them with everything weåÛåªve got but theyåÛåªre still coming. In the end thatåÛåªs on me.åÛå         The public is so inured to responsibility-taking by executives under fire that itåÛåªs little more than a polite reflex like åÛåÏthank you for your service.åÛå George W. Bush took responsibility for the Katrina foul-ups for heaven sake.         Presidents have generally been bad about apologies. See: Richard Nixon resigning. (åÛåÏI would say only that if some of my judgments were wrong and some were wrong they were made in what I believed at the time to be the best interest of the nation.åÛå) Bill Clinton was more forthcoming when he apologized for lying about Monica Lewinsky. (åÛåÏI misled people including even my wife.åÛå) But he had a little help from a grand jury.         George W. Bush still hasnåÛåªt said heåÛåªs sorry for getting us into Iraq although in his book åÛåÏDecision PointsåÛå W. did express deep deep regret that there werenåÛåªt any weapons of mass destruction because it threw a shadow over what he still sees as a really excellent undertaking.         (Second point of comfort on the Obamacare rollout: Not as bad as the war in Iraq.)         We havenåÛåªt seen a whole lot of truly satisfying apologies on a high level; itåÛåªs been more than half a century since a British official who lied about an adulterous fling showed how sorry he was by going off to clean toilets for the poor. The best we can generally hope for is a specific explanation of how the politician in question screwed up and how heåÛåªs going to make it right.         At his press conference the president noted åÛåÓ kind of bragged really åÛåÓ that the Obama campaign had been spot-on when it came to information technology. Then he complained that the way the federal government purchases I.T. åÛåÏis cumbersome complicated and outdated.åÛå         Since he already knew åÛåÏthat the federal government has not been good at this stuff in the paståÛå Obama continued his crack advisers should have prepared to go around that problem åÛåÏtwo years agoåÛå when planning for the rollout began.         Yes!         åÛåÏ... But that doesnåÛåªt help us now. WeåÛåªve got to move forward.åÛå         Sigh.

Michael C. Skakel a cousin of the Kennedys was ordered free from prison on Thursday to await a possible retrial.         Judge Gary White of Connecticut Superior Court in Stamford set bail at $1.2 million ordering Mr. Skakel not to leave the state without permission and to wear a tracking device. The bail hearing came after another judge ruled last month that Mr. Skakel did not receive a fair trial because his first lawyer Mickey Sherman  had not represented him effectively  depriving him of his constitutionally guaranteed right to counsel.         As Judge White made his announcement friends and relatives of Mr. Skakel burst out in applause. Mr. Skakel dressed in a suit and blue tie tapped his chest as he walked out of the courtroom. Shortly after 2 p.m. he emerged from the basement of the courthouse and embraced supporters in enthusiastic bear hugs. He stood silently while his lawyer spoke to the throng of reporters outside before being whisked away in a waiting car.         Hubert J. Santos Mr. SkakelåÛåªs current lawyer declined to publicly reveal where Mr. Skakel would go once he was released. His brother John Skakel who lives in Portland Ore. provided bank checks to cover the bail.         It was the latest twist in a case that has fascinated the public and confounded investigators since 1975 when the battered body of Martha Moxley 15 was found beneath a tree in her familyåÛåªs backyard pieces of a broken 6-iron golf club by her side.         Mr. Skakel 53 was also 15 at the time of the murder and the two were neighbors in a town that has long been a bastion of wealth. At different times both Mr. Skakel and his brother Thomas were suspected of killing Ms. Moxley. But it was more than a quarter of a century before Mr. Skakel  was tried and convicted . In 2002 he was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.         The judge who ruled last month Thomas A. Bishop of Superior Court in Rockville wrote in a scathing 136-page decision that Mr. Sherman failed to show an attention to detail lacked a coherent strategy and åÛåÏwas in a myriad of ways ineffective.åÛå Those failures he wrote led to a åÛåÏconviction that lacks reliability.åÛå         After the ruling Mr. Santos filed a motion for his client to be released on bail. In a later hearing Judge Bishop decided that the question of whether to grant bail belonged with the criminal court in Stamford where Mr. Skakel will be retried if the state decides to go forward with another prosecution.         From the outset the case has attracted national news media attention offering a potent mix of power money and sex. It inspired a made-for-television movie and became a staple for tabloids and an unending source of interest for true-crime writers particularly Dominick Dunne.         Mr. Skakel is the nephew of Ethel Skakel Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy and the link to one of AmericaåÛåªs most famous families fueled additional interest in the case.         His trial in 2002 lasted three weeks and revealed tawdry details about his life as a young man including his drinking and his drug use. In his defense Mr. Skakel acknowledged that on the night of the murder he had climbed a tree and masturbated while trying to look into Ms. MoxleyåÛåªs bedroom.         During the trial the prosecution painted Mr. Skakel as an emotionally disturbed man who was consumed with guilt after the killing prompting confessions and suicide attempts. In one particularly vivid example cited in court documents a man employed by the family as a gardener described how Mr. Skakel once tried to jump off the Triborough Bridge after saying that åÛåÏhe had done something very bad and that he needed to get out of the country and that he had to kill himself.åÛå         Mr. Skakel has always publicly maintained his innocence.         Throughout the trials and appeals Mr. SkakelåÛåªs family has fought fiercely on his behalf  spending millions of dollars  in various bids to win his freedom.         On Thursday the prosecutors did not object to the setting of bail just the amount. Mr. Santos suggested $500000; John Smirga the lawyer for the state recommended a number closer to $2 million. Among the factors he wanted the judge to consider were the brutality of the murder and Mr. SkakelåÛåªs resources character and mental condition.         Mr. Santos dismissed the notion that his client could flee if he wanted to given the notoriety of the case. åÛåÏHis is the most recognized face in AmericaåÛå he said. åÛåÏSo heåÛåªs not going anywhere.åÛå         At a news conference outside the courthouse on Thursday  Ms. MoxleyåÛåªs mother Dorthy  and brother John expressed disappointment at the decision but confidence that Judge BishopåÛåªs decision to overturn the conviction would be reversed by the stateåÛåªs appeal.         åÛåÏWe knew this day would come so I wasnåÛåªt completely destroyedåÛå Mrs. Moxley said adding åÛåÏThereåÛåªs a lesson to parents: If your child does something wrong face up to it.åÛå         Mr. Santos used the bail hearing to once again criticize the original prosecution of Mr. Skakel. He said the case had been weak and was based on hearsay.         åÛåÏIf the prosecution found a homeless guy at a train stationåÛå who claimed that Mr. Skakel confessed to the murder Mr. Santos said åÛåÏhe would be on the stand in a New York minute.åÛå         Mr. Smirga defended the handling of the case but also noted the difficulties of prosecuting a crime so long after it took place.         åÛåÏEach time the facts of this case are presented they mutateåÛå he said. There was no single piece of evidence åÛåÓ like DNA an eyewitness or a photograph åÛåÓ that could be used against the defendant he said.         He compared the case to åÛåÏa giant jigsaw puzzleåÛå but one without a picture to show what it is supposed to look like when all the pieces are put together. Mr. Smirga said he was confident the state solved the puzzle and vowed to continue in its appeal of Judge BishopåÛåªs decision to vacate the conviction. åÛåÏHis lawyer was found ineffectiveåÛå Mr. Smirga said. åÛåÏBut he hasnåÛåªt been found innocent in any forum.åÛå         Mr. Santos said Judge BishopåÛåªs ruling revealed flaws in the stateåÛåªs case against Mr. Skakel.         Mr. Santos and the Skakel family said they would continue to fight until Mr. Skakel was fully vindicated.         åÛåÏThis is the first step in correcting a terrible wrongåÛå the Skakel family said in a statement. åÛåÏWe look forward to Michael being vindicated and justice finally being served.åÛå         Mr. Skakel was ordered to have no contact with the Moxley family.         He has a 14-year-old son but after more than a decade in prison no home to return to. His lawyer declined to publicly reveal where Mr. Skakel would go once he was released.         While the joy of the Skakel family was evident in the courtroom Mr. Moxley said he could not see how anyone could be happy about all that has happened.         He said that even if Judge BishopåÛåªs ruling cast doubt on Mr. SkakelåÛåªs guilt it left a cloud of suspicion over his brother Thomas who was 17 when Ms. Moxley was killed. He was the last person known to have seen her alive.         åÛåÏIt is difficult to fathom how there could be any victory in thisåÛå he said.

Chris Christie  who ordered the shutdown.         Officials in Fort Lee N.J. which turned into a parking lot when local access lanes to the bridge were closed on the first day of school have charged that the closings were retaliation against the boroughåÛåªs mayor a Democrat who had declined to endorse Mr. Christie a Republican for re-election.         Michael Nestor the deputy inspector general and director of investigations at the Port Authority confirmed the inquiry and another official with knowledge of the matter said it would seek to determine whether any crimes had been committed and whether there was any åÛåÏabuse of authorityåÛå or åÛåÏgross mismanagement.åÛå         At a legislative hearing in Trenton on Monday two Port Authority employees said that they were told to close the lanes by David Wildstein a high school classmate of Mr. ChristieåÛåªs and a former political blogger who worked as director of interstate capital projects; Mr. ChristieåÛåªs chief appointee at the authority created the position for him.         They said Mr. Wildstein instructed them not to tell anyone leaving in the dark Fort Lee officials the news media and the Port AuthorityåÛåªs executive director. They said they advised against the move but complied because they feared for their jobs and understood that Mr. Wildstein was working at the behest of Mr. ChristieåÛåªs appointee Bill Baroni.         Mr. Baroni had previously testified that the lanes were closed as part of a traffic study. But the Port Authority employees and the executive director Patrick J. Foye testified that there was no traffic study.         Mr. Wildstein said on Friday that he would step down on Jan. 1.

There are still major hurdles to surmount but the strides made raise the prospects that the website will be able to help millions of Americans buy policies from private insurers on new insurance exchanges either by Dec. 23 the deadline for policies that will take effect on Jan. 1 or by March 31 the deadline for taking out coverage without being fined. There will be federal subsidies to help those on modest incomes pay the premiums.         The website HealthCare.gov was supposed to be ready on Oct. 1 but an array of technical problems made it impossible for all but a trickle of customers to compare policies and enroll in a plan. For some weeks in October the site was down 60 percent of the time. That dire situation at the front end of the process has been largely corrected through a frantic repair effort over the past five weeks but it wonåÛåªt be enough unless the final back-end stage of enrollment is fixed as well.         On Sunday the administration issued a progress report asserting that the system was running smoothly for a vast majority of users that the site was now working more than 90 percent of the time and that consumers were getting much better feedback from the site than before. Thanks to software and hardware improvements the average page is loading in less than a second compared with an average of 8 seconds in late October and the number of frustrating error messages that block people from using the site has fallen below 1 percent.         The administration estimated that the site could support 50000 users at the same time that users spend an average of 20 to 30 minutes on it and that the site can support 800000 visits a day. We wonåÛåªt know how accurate those projections are until that many users try to use it. The website serves 36 states but many other states have set up their own exchanges several of which are working better than the federal exchanges. Some are in worse shape.         The big challenge ahead is to upgrade the back-end systems that transmit information to insurance companies so that they can complete the enrollment process. Consumers have until Dec. 23 to sign up for policies effective on Jan. 1 leaving only three weeks to solve the back-end problem. In some cases insurers have no record of some people who think they have enrolled or have received inaccurate or incomplete information for some enrollees. One big problem is that some insurers say they have not been told what subsidies a customer will get and what premium should be paid by the customer.         If those problems canåÛåªt be fixed quickly the administration will need to find alternate ways for people to enroll and get subsidies without going through the website.

Yet somehow it felt as if the United States national team lost.         That was the popular sentiment anyway after the World Cup draw ceremony was held in Costa do Sauipe Brazil and the United States found itself placed in a preliminary-round group with the European juggernaut Germany; Portugal and its star wing Cristiano Ronaldo; and an African nemesis Ghana that has eliminated the United States from the past two World Cups.         To many observers the United States was stuck with the worst draw among the 32 teams. In addition to facing three opponents ranked in the top 25 in the world (two in the top 5) the Americans will have to travel nearly 9000 miles to and from their training base in SÌÄå£o Paulo to play their matches.         Making matters worse the game against Portugal will take place in the humid climate of Manaus a port city in the Amazon rain forest that seemed to be the host site that every coach wanted to avoid. Only the top two teams in each of the eight groups will advance to the knockout rounds.         åÛåÏWe hit the worst of the worståÛå United States Manager Jurgen Klinsmann said of his teamåÛåªs schedule. He added: åÛåÏItåÛåªs one of the most difficult groups in the whole draw. It couldnåÛåªt get any more difficult or any bigger. But thatåÛåªs what the World Cup is about and weåÛåªll take it on. Hopefully we can surprise some people.åÛå         At minimum the United States will be familiar with its opponents. Klinsmann won the 1990 World Cup with West Germany and coached the German national team to a third-place finish at the 2006 tournament. The United States also faced Germany in the 1998 and 2002 World Cups losing each time.         Ghana is no stranger to the United States either as it has faced åÛåÓ and beaten åÛåÓ the United States in the last two World Cups. In an odd twist Ghana advanced to next yearåÛåªs tournament by winning a qualifying playoff against Egypt åÛåÓ which was coached by the American Bob Bradley who was in charge of the United States team that was eliminated by Ghana in 2010.         åÛåÏAfter two losses itåÛåªs about time to beat them I guessåÛå Klinsmann said.         While some might see the United StatesåÛåª Group G as an obvious choice as the proverbial Group of Death other groups appear more straightforward. Brazil which is hoping to add to its record five World Cup titles seems like a favorite to advance. It will open the tournament on

The report  by McKinsey & Company which was prepared in late March at the request of the Department of Health and Human Services said that management indecision and a åÛåÏlack of transparency and alignment on critical issuesåÛå were threatening progress despite the tight deadline.         The McKinsey report found that the effort was at risk because of issues including åÛåÏsignificant dependency on external parties/contractorsåÛå as well as åÛåÏinsufficient time and scope of end-to-end testingåÛå and åÛåÏparallel stacking of all phasesåÛå all predictions that have turned out to be accurate. Briefings on the report were held in the spring at the White House and at the headquarters of the Health and Human Services Department and for leaders at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid congressional investigators said.         åÛåÏThe administration was on track åÛåÓ on track for a disaster åÛåÓ and yet officials refused to be transparent with the Congress and the American peopleåÛå said Representative Fred Upton Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee which released the report. The McKinsey warnings were first reported online by The Washington Post.         A White House spokesman said the report raised important points but that the Obama administration moved immediately to address them such as revising the decision-making process at the Health and Human Services agency to address so-called critical path issues. åÛåÏAs we have said many times now and as has been frequently reported flags were definitely raised throughout the development of the website as would be the case for any IT project this complexåÛå said Eric Schultz the White House spokesman. åÛåÏBut nobody anticipated the size and scope of the problems we experienced once the site launched.åÛå         The latest evidence detailing the Web siteåÛåªs troubled startup came amid signs of progress in repairing it. As of mid-November more than 50000 people had selected an insurance plan åÛåÓ up from 27000 in the entire month of October people working on the project said.         That is still a fraction of the number the administration had hoped for. And specialists plowing through an initial list of more than 600 software and hardware defects remain worried about whether they can meet the administrationåÛåªs goal of enabling four in five users to enroll through the online federal exchange HealthCare.gov by Nov. 30. One person said a more realistic goal was that four out of five people åÛåÏhave a positive experienceåÛå which could include being redirected to customer service agents.         White House officials said on Monday that many of the remaining users would turn to call-in or counseling centers because their insurance situations were complicated. But specialists involved in the repair effort said technical issues may frustrate more users than administration officials suggest. And it is unclear how many fixes remain to be made because the list keeps changing.         White House officials and some computer experts say much of the criticism is overblown designed more to scare would-be enrollees away from the insurance exchanges. But the concern is bipartisan. At a closed-door meeting last week two Democratic senators pressed administration officials on efforts by Chinese hackers to break into the site according to a Democratic Senate official at the meeting.         åÛåÏWhen consumers fill out their online marketplace applications they can trust that the information that they are providing is protected by stringent security standardsåÛå said Patti Unruh a spokeswoman for the health departmentåÛåªs Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services which is responsible for the federal exchange. åÛåÏSecurity testing happens on an ongoing basis using industry best practices to appropriately safeguard consumersåÛåª personal information.åÛå

But 17 years later the department has slowed the work to a pace that makes completion of the cleanup by the projected date of 2023 highly unlikely. Energy officials now say the work will not be done until well into the 2040s when the aging underground tanks that hold the bomb waste in the South Carolina lowlands will be 90 years old.         åÛåÏI donåÛåªt know what the tanksåÛåª design life was intended to be but itåÛåªs not for infinityåÛå the stateåÛåªs chief environmental official Catherine B. Templeton said in an interview.         The slowdown has set off a fierce battle between the Energy Department and South Carolina where officials say they have been double-crossed in what they view as the stateåÛåªs biggest environmental threat. In an unusual display of resistance from a state that was host to a major part of the Cold War effort to make nuclear weapons åÛåÓ and is now home to most of the resulting radioactive waste åÛåÓ South Carolina is threatening to impose $154 million in fines on the federal government for failing to meet its promised schedule.         Energy Department officials counter that the slowdown is a temporary effect of budget stringency in Washington and that Congress has tied their hands. A combination of the across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration and a 2011 cap on military spending åÛåÓ of which the environmental cleanup is technically part åÛåÓ do not leave them with enough money to meet their commitments they say.         åÛåÏThereåÛåªs only so much to go aroundåÛå said  Terrel J. Spears  the Energy DepartmentåÛåªs assistant manager for waste disposition here. åÛåÏWe canåÛåªt increase the budgets. Now we have to balance the budgets.åÛå         Energy officials acknowledge however that for each additional year the waste stays in the tanks they will have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on maintenance and security.         In South CarolinaåÛåªs reckoning some of the money that should be spent on Savannah is going to a factory that the Energy Department is trying to finish at its Hanford nuclear reservation near Richland Wash. to process similar wastes there. But those wastes are more complex and  contractors have faced even tougher technical problems . That schedule has slipped repeatedly.         Giving more money to Hanford Ms. Templeton insisted was åÛåÏrewarding bad behavioråÛå by site managers there.         South Carolina and the Energy Department do agree on one thing: The current slowdown comes on top of past technical problems that pushed back the start of work by more than seven years and that more than doubled the cost.         Ms. Templeton said the tanks which are near the Savannah River already have leaks and are buried in soil below the water table meaning that underground water flows around them.         åÛåÏWe have to get that waste out of the tanks so itåÛåªs not Fukushima so you donåÛåªt have the groundwater interacting with the waste and running offåÛå she said referring to the damaged Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan where natural flows of subterranean water pick up contamination from the reactors and flow into the sea.         At the Washington State Department of Ecology Suzanne Dahl the tank waste treatment manager said: åÛåÏI feel their pain. We think the same things out here.åÛå All the deadlines there in an agreement approved by a Federal District Court will be missed. Ms. Dahl said that in the 1990s her state approved a request by the Energy Department to delay work on solidifying wastes at Hanford while the technology was tried out first at Savannah River; Savannah River therefore has a 17-year head start she said.         At Savannah the Energy Department did succeed in building the worldåÛåªs largest factory for stabilizing the liquid bomb waste done by mixing it with molten glass and pouring it into stainless steel canisters 10 feet high by two feet across. The stabilized waste should then last for millenniums.         The department has also perfected a technique for separating nearly all of the troublesome radioactive materials from salts in the underground tanks to reduce the volume that must be mixed with the molten glass. The rest of the radioactive material is mixed with cement that will bind it up for centuries. Last year the factory began the business of making the canisters and produced 325 of them åÛåÓ a respectable fraction of the 7824 department officials say will be needed.

Such a delay broached by Ahmet Uzumcu the director general of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons would be the first in the timetable of the eradication program which began more than two months ago and is considered so far to be an extraordinary and conspicuous success in a country at war.         Mr. Uzumcu spoke less than a week after the United Nations official in charge of coordinating the eradication program Sigrid Kaag  told the Security Council  that transporting the most dangerous cargo overland to the Syrian port of Latakia for export and destruction as envisioned in the plan would be quite dangerous because the roads were unsafe. Ms. Kaag said Syrian military forces were trying to secure them.         Chemical weapons experts have determined that the Syrian arsenal which includes more than 1000 tons of munitions like sarin mustard gas and other toxic substances must be transported using roads linking Damascus and other areas to Latakia a Mediterranean port that is a government stronghold. But the roads traverse rebel-controlled areas.         åÛåÏIn view of the circumstances in this country it will be quite difficult to meet this timelineåÛå Mr. Uzumcu was quoted by news services as saying at a news conference in Oslo. He was in Norway to accept the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of his organization at a ceremony on Tuesday.         Under the  timeline  for destruction of the weapons and the materials used to create them the åÛåÏmost criticalåÛå chemicals are to be transported out of Syria by Dec. 31 other chemical substances and precursors must be removed by Feb. 5 all chemical weapons facilities must be destroyed by March 2014 and the entire arsenal must be destroyed åÛåÏin the safest and soonest manneråÛå no later than June 30.         Mr. Uzumcu told reporters in Oslo that the most dangerous chemicals might have to be exported from Latakia in early January. He expressed confidence that åÛåÏthe deadline of the end of June next year will be met.åÛå         He spoke as SyriaåÛåªs state-run news media asserted that the army had taken control of one highway connecting Damascus to the coast. A senior Foreign Ministry official in Russia which helped arrange the agreement in which Syria pledged to surrender its chemical weapons said the Russians were willing to help transport the chemicals to Latakia. åÛåÏThis issue is being discussedåÛå the Voice of Russia radio service quoted the official the deputy foreign minister Mikhail Bogdanov  as saying.    Ms. Kaag said last week that the chemicals would be transported from Latakia to an unspecified foreign port where they would be transferred to a United States naval vessel capable of rendering the chemicals harmless at sea.

I do not mean that it is too critical: Sometimes it is sometimes it isnåÛåªt. I mean that the state is too often judged for its viability or its validity as if some fundamental acceptance of its reality is pending upon the resolution of its many problems with itself and with others. About the severity of those problems there is no question and some of them broach primary issues of politics and morality; but IsraelåÛåªs problems are too often combined and promoted into a Problem which has the effect of emptying the Jewish state of its actuality and consigning it to a historical provisionality a permanent condition of controversy from which it can be released only by furnishing various justifications and explanations.         In its early years Israel liked to think of itself as an experiment in the realization of various ideals and hopes but really all societies including Arab ones are in the matter of justice experiments; and existence itself must never be regarded as an experiment as if anybody has the authority to declare that the experiment has failed and to try and do something about it. Israel is not a proposition it is a country. Its facticity is one of the great accomplishments of the JewsåÛåª history and one of the great accomplishments of liberalismåÛåªs and socialismåÛåªs and nationalismåÛåªs histories and it is not complacent or apologetic to say so. The problems are not going away. I cannot say the same about the sense of greatness.         It is one of the achievements of Ari ShavitåÛåªs important and powerful book to recover the feeling of IsraelåÛåªs facticity and to revel in it to restore the grandeur of the simple fact in full view of the complicated facts. åÛåÏMy Promised LandåÛå startles in many ways not least in its relative lack of interest in providing its readers with a handy politics. Shavit a columnist who serves on the editorial board of Haaretz has an undoctrinaire mind. He comes not to praise or to blame though along the way he does both with erudition and with eloquence; he comes instead to observe and to reflect.         This is the least tendentious book about Israel I have ever read. It is a Zionist book unblinkered by Zionism. It is about the entirety of the Israeli experience. Shavit is immersed in all of the history of his country. While some of it offends him none of it is alien to him. His extraordinary chapter on the charismatic and corrupt Aryeh Deri and the rise of Sephardic religious politics in Israel richly illustrates the reach of his understanding.         Nowhere is Shavit a stranger in his own land. The naturalness of his identity the ease with which he travels among his own people has the paradoxical effect of freeing him for a genuine confrontation with the contradictions and the crimes he discovers. His straightforward honesty is itself evidence of the åÛåÏnormalizationåÛå to which the founders of Zionism aspired for the Jews in their homeland; but it nicely confounds their expectation that normality would bring only contentment. Anxiety skepticism fear and horror are also elements of a normal life.         Shavit begins IsraelåÛåªs story at the beginning: with Zionism and its utopian projects of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It has been a long time since I encountered a secular observer of Israeli society who is still so enchanted by the land and still so moved by the original visions of what could be established on it. åÛåÏZionismåÛåªs missionåÛå as Shavit correctly describes it was to rescue the Jews from destruction in exile; and he has too much dignity to entertain second thoughts about the appetite for life. åÛåÏThe need was realåÛå he writes. åÛåÏThe vision was impressive åÛåÓ ambitious but not mad. And the persistence was unique: For over a century Zionism displayed extraordinary determination imagination and innovation.åÛå There is something almost wicked about such a full-throated love of country in a journalist so sophisticated åÛåÓ and about such a full-throated love of Israel.

All 10 of the black-leather-and-chrome swivel seats the same kind youåÛåªd perch on to play the slots at the Venetian in Las Vegas were taken.ÌâåÊMost of us had reserved a month before. Now we found ourselves sitting in the small bright glossy black-and-white front room of the restaurant which opened in August in the West Village. It looked about as Japanese as  Peter Luger . Servers in black suits were offering hot towels water and drinks and more water and then small talk until it became clear that they were stalling. Were they going to let us eat?         Finally Daisuke Nakazawa walked in the front door. åÛåÏIåÛåªm sorryåÛå the chef said cheerfully as he slid behind the counter and prepared for work. He had just come back from  Pier 76  he said. The police had towed his car.         Then he picked up a palmful of rice and began to serve one of the four most enjoyable and eye-opening sushi meals I have ever eaten. I had the other three at Sushi Nakazawa over the next few weeks.         The moment-to-moment joys of eating one mouthful of sushi after another can merge into a blur of fish bliss. But almost everything Mr. Nakazawa cups in his hands and places in front of you is an event on its own. A piece of his sushi grabs control of your senses and when itåÛåªs gone you wish you could have it again. These little events carve themselves into your memory. So does the meal 21 pieces or so over about two hours.         I remember precisely the dull luster of Mr. NakazawaåÛåªs mackerel and the way its initial firmness gave way to a minor-key note of pickled fish and a major-key richness that kept building the longer I chewed. I can feel the warmth of just-poached blue shrimp from the South Pacific islands of New Caledonia which had a flavor that was deep clean and delicate at the same time. I can tell you about the burning-leaf smell of skipjack smoked over smoldering hay until it becomes a softer aquatic version of aged Italian speck.         We donåÛåªt normally think of one sushi piece as wildly different from the next apart from the inherent qualities of the main ingredient. But one of the points made by the 2011 documentary  åÛåÏJiro Dreams of SushiåÛå  was that a driven obsessed chef will treat each sea creature as a unique challenge. HeåÛåªll ask how can I make the best piece of horse mackerel anyone has ever tasted? When Jiro Ono dreamed of sushi what he saw were new dishes waiting to be invented.         In the movie Mr. Nakazawa was the young apprentice who cried when Mr. Ono conceded that he had finally made an acceptable egg custard. With his shaved scalp bowed head downturned eyes and meek acceptance of Mr. OnoåÛåªs criticisms he gave the impression of a novice Zen monk who was accustomed to abuse in the name of enlightenment. (He also gave you the idea that Jiro could be kind of a pill.)         Mr. Nakazawa must have learned something because his fish often tastes as if it has been coaxed along until itåÛåªs as delicious as itåÛåªs ever going to get. Each slice has a slightly different temperature affecting flavor and texture whether it spreads on your tongue or stays firm and chewy. All good sushi chefs do this but Mr. Nakazawa seems to be able to hit any point on the thermometer with an assassinåÛåªs aim locating a temperature for yellowtail belly that makes its buttery richness into a time-release pleasure bomb.         He gets other effects by skipping the standard wasabi smear. He dabs Japanese mustard under medium-fatty tuna and the hay-smoked skipjack bringing out its bloody-lip tang.

That scallop dish is distinctively his and once youåÛåªve had it youåÛåªd know it anywhere.         Not everything I ate was in that category and not everything is the best in town.

No restaurant in town does as much with sushi and sushi alone as Nakazawa.         Behind the counter of Sushi Nakazawa the chef is nothing like the movieåÛåªs humble stepchild. He laughs he jokes he handles live animals. One evening he held out a tray of sea urchins their spikes groping the air and asked each of us to choose one. The tiger shrimp he set down on white plates another night had more energy. With a flick of its tail one jumped up in front of a woman at the counteråÛåªs end. She jumped even higher. Another customer more game picked up the shrimp just above its wriggling legs pointed toward his mouth in pantomime (Mr. Nakazawa is learning English) and asked the chef åÛåÏWhat is the best way?åÛå         The best way is to wait until Mr. Nakazawa yanks off its head strips its shell and drapes the raw shrimp over a cushion of rice. Everything is gently pressed over rice in the two-century-old Edo style of sushi that Mr. Nakazawa respects and refines. Sashimi is not served and there are no hot dishes from the kitchen.

Britain is growing faster than many other big rich economies although it has still not passed its pre-crisis peak. There are some concerns however that it is a housing-led recovery - and a potential bubble - spurred by government stimulus.         The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said on Tuesday that 59 percent of surveyors in November forecast prices would rise over the next three months the highest reading since September 1999.         Speaking in New York ahead of the survey Carney signalled that monetary policy was not about to be tightened even though there were potential dangers in the housing market.         ""We're concerned about potential developments in the housing market"" Carney said. He said activity in the housing sector was lower than before the financial crisis and bank underwriting standards had been ""substantially transformed"".         ""But there is a history of things shifting in the UK and the housing market of moving from stall speed to warp speed and underwriting standards slipping. So we want to avoid that"" Carney said.         The RICS measure of house prices hit +58 in November edging up from October to an 11-year high as government incentives and more optimism on the economy helped spur demand.         Economists in a Reuters poll had predicted the price index would rise to +60. Positive readings mean more members reported price rises rather than falls in the preceding three months.         Prices rose for a second consecutive month in every area of Britain while the average number of homes sold per chartered surveyor grew to 20.6 up from 15.9 in the same period of 2012.         But RICS warned again of a lack of homes available to buy.         ""If there is not a meaningful increase in new homes the likelihood is that prices and for that matter rents will continue to push upwards making the cost of shelter ever more unaffordable"" said Simon Rubinsohn RICS's chief economist.         Separate data showed Britain was making some progress in slowly reducing its reliance on consumers. Manufacturing output rose for a second month in October but the country's trade deficit was bigger than forecasts.         WARP SPEED?         In an upbeat message before the Christmas season Carney said Britain's recovery was showing signs it can reach self-sustaining momentum but no tightening was on the horizon.         ""The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come suggests that it is unlikely that equilibrium interest rates will return to historically normal levels any time soon"" Carney said.         ""This prospect puts a premium on macro-prudential policies and financial reforms to manage the associated risks without abandoning the need to keep interest rates in line with the equilibrium level.""         The Bank of England has held interest rates at 0.5 percent since 2009 bought 375 billion pounds' worth of government debt and undertaken other stimulus measures to spur the recovery.         RICS forecast house prices would increase by 3 percent next year and by almost 5 percent a year over the next five years.         On November 28 the Bank of England refocused one of Britain's programmes to boost mortgage lending the Funding for Lending Scheme away from providing credit for house purchases.         Separately on Tuesday a group representing mortgage lenders predicted a rise in credit flowing into the housing market over the next two years but played down concerns about a bubble caused by the government's Help to Buy programme.         The Council for Mortgage Lenders forecast a rise in gross mortgage lending to 195 billion pounds next year and 206 billion pounds in 2015 up from 170 billion pounds this year.         However it saw a possible ceiling for prices which might peak during 2014 or 2015 due to new affordability rules squeezed incomes and verification checks on would-be borrowers.

He is a newcomer to this quiet corner of south-central Pennsylvania who retired here after a long Coast Guard career.         But in the throw-out-the-bums anger percolating in the election cycle now underway Mr. Halvorson 58 believes he might have a shot to displace a name that has occupied this House seat since Mr. ShusteråÛåªs father won it in 1972. After two House elections dominated by the small-government philosophy of the  Tea Party  2014 may be driven by a less ideological but more emotional sentiment: clean house.         åÛåÏPeople donåÛåªt remember a time before the ShustersåÛå Mr. Halvorson said. åÛåÏThey created an aristocracy and people are so accustomed to thatåÛåªs the way politics is done around here they donåÛåªt see how he can be toppled. IåÛåªve got to show leadershipåÛåªs whatåÛåªs important not seniority and longevity is not leadership.åÛå         The outcome of this and at least 17 other primaries next year may have a negligible impact on Republican control of the House. Few would suggest that PennsylvaniaåÛåªs Ninth Congressional District is in danger of slipping into Democratic hands. But in the heated battle over the ideological future of the  Republican Party  races like this one could alter the complexion of the Republican caucus in the House åÛåÓ and WashingtonåÛåªs ability to govern in President ObamaåÛåªs final years in office.         åÛåÏThatåÛåªs the narrative everybody wants to know: WhatåÛåªs the Republican Party going to look like after Ted Cruz Tea Party people get done with it?åÛå Mr. Halvorson asked eschewing the Tea Party label even as he adopts many of its campaign tropes. åÛåÏWhoåÛåªs going to have the ascendancy?åÛå         From Tennessee to Michigan to Oregon House Republicans are facing an onslaught of primary challenges. But unlike the last two election cycles there is almost no ideological pattern to the contests.         Representatives Justin Amash and Kerry Bentivolio of Michigan and Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee åÛåÓ all Tea Party lawmakers in good standing åÛåÓ are threatened by potential challengers backed by business groups and their more traditional Republican allies. Those challenges are not so much from the partyåÛåªs left but more from a new breed of candidates hoping to åÛåÏprofessionalizeåÛå a House Republican caucus whose image has been battered by the turmoil in Washington.         Even the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee Representative Greg Walden of Oregon has drawn a credible challenger from the partyåÛåªs right Dennis Linthicum the chairman of the  Klamath County Board of Commissioners .         åÛåÏSomebody has to get serious about looking at spending the growth of government the regulatory aspects that discourage business and risk-takingåÛå said Mr. Linthicum who called Mr. Walden a åÛåÏstatiståÛå who åÛåÏwould prefer to keep government in the size shape and fashion in which it currently exists.åÛå         How such contests resolve themselves could leave the House Republican caucus either more uncompromisingly conservative in 2015 or more committed to governance and compromise.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs an offshoot of the decline in competitive districts because of redistrictingåÛå said David Wasserman a House analyst at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. åÛåÏThere are fewer fights to pick with the other party so there are going to be more fights within your party.åÛå         In some sense the fight for the heart of the House Republican caucus began last Tuesday in Alabama when Bradley Byrne a business-backed former state senator fought off a Tea Party-supported firebrand to win a special House election in Mobile.         In Tennessee Mr. DesJarlais has maintained his Tea Party bona fides since the 2010 wave swept him into Congress. But the taint of scandal has followed him since divorce records exposed accusations of violent behavior as well as a telephone transcript indicating that as a practicing doctor he had an affair with a patient and encouraged her to get an abortion. Another former patient emerged last year to say that she too had had an affair with Mr. DesJarlais and had smoked marijuana with him.         The hits have kept coming since then and State Senator Jim Tracy is now considered the favorite in the primary fight in August.         In Michigan business-backed candidates are challenging Mr. Amash and Mr. Bentivolio two black sheep of the House Republican conference. Mr. Amash has electrified the libertarian wing of the Republican Party with his crusade against domestic spying his willingness to challenge his partyåÛåªs defense hawks and his opposition to even the most austere budget plans of his leadership which he invariably condemns as timid taps at the Big Government edifice.

The draft leaked to me by someone desperate to prevent reinstatement of this Taliban-era punishment is just the latest in a pattern of increasingly determined attacks on womenåÛåªs rights in Afghanistan.         The last 12 years have been a time of significant achievements here hard-fought by Afghan activists. Millions of girls have gone to school women have joined the police and the army and the civil service. Twenty-eight percent of the members of AfghanistanåÛåªs Parliament are women and a 2009 law made violence against women a crime.         But signs are everywhere that a rollback of womenåÛåªs rights has begun in anticipation of next yearåÛåªs deadline for the withdrawal of international combat forces. Opponents of womenåÛåªs rights are already taking advantage of growing international fatigue with Afghanistan.         On Monday the United Nations issued a new report showing that while reported cases of violence against women went up by 28 percent in the last year prosecutions increased by only 2 percent. A parliamentary debate last May on the Law on the Elimination of Violence Against Women was derailed by conservatives calling for the abolition of a minimum marriage age for girls and arguing against making rape a crime. One of President Hamid KarzaiåÛåªs new handpicked commissioners at the governmentåÛåªs previously well-respected Independent Human Rights Commission is an ex-member of the Taliban government who wasted no time after his appointment before calling for the repeal of the EVAW Law which he said åÛåÏviolates Islam.åÛå         These setbacks have occurred against a backdrop of continuing day-to-day abuses against women that are so commonplace that some extreme practices go almost unnoticed.         About half the women in prison in Afghanistan and about 95 percent of girls in juvenile detention åÛåÓ a total of about 600 people åÛåÓ are imprisoned on accusations of åÛåÏmoral crimesåÛå like sex outside of marriage or running away from home. In reality most have fled forced marriages or domestic violence. Some are survivors of rape who are blamed by the courts for åÛåÏimmoralityåÛå sometimes alongside their attackers.         Their stories are a call to the Afghan government to do much more to track down and punish abusers of women and to crack down on police officers prosecutors and judges who treat women fleeing abuse as criminals rather than victims. Above all the government needs to end the barbaric practice of virginity tests. Whenever a woman or girl is arrested on åÛåÏmoralityåÛå charges åÛåÓ and sometimes even when she is accused of non-moral crimes such as theft or assault åÛåÓ she is whisked away for a vaginal examination at a government clinic in the province in which she was arrested. There is no opportunity for her to refuse.         Because of frequent mix-ups and general inefficiency some women are sent for the examination two or three times. The examination carried out by government doctors results in a report on whether or not the woman or girl is a åÛåÏvirgin.åÛå         These reports are often used as the sole evidence to support åÛåÏmoral crimesåÛå charges in court aside from a åÛåÏconfessionåÛå taken down by a police officer immediately after the arrest which is usually signed with a thumbprint by a woman or girl who has no idea what it says. I have seen cases where a judge used the report as evidence against a girl even when its findings were inconclusive. For many of the 600 women and girls imprisoned for åÛåÏmoral crimesåÛå the doctoråÛåªs observations are a key factor in her receiving a stiff prison sentence.         Forcing these women and girls to undergo invasive vaginal examinations sometimes repeatedly to ascertain åÛåÏvirginityåÛå as evidence likely to be used against them in criminal proceedings is not only a form of degrading and inhuman treatment strictly prohibited by international law but also a violation of their basic fair trial rights.         All of this would be horrific enough if it werenåÛåªt bad science but it is. åÛåÏVirginityåÛå tests have no medical validity. A medical examination cannot determine with any level of accuracy useful to a court a womanåÛåªs sexual history.         And despite progress in other countries in banning such examinations there are no signs of this practice ending in Afghanistan. For vulnerable Afghan women things are only getting worse. One recently proposed law revision would ban victims of crime from testifying against family members åÛåÓ effectively preventing all prosecutions for domestic violence and forced or underage marriage. Female activists in Afghanistan who have accomplished so much in the past 12 years are doing all they can now to prevent that progress from unraveling. Countries including the United States have pledged continued funding for services for Afghan women but in addition to aid they need political support. International support for the Afghan government and its security must depend on continued progress for Afghan women. Anything less would be a betrayal.

GoogleåÛåªs offices are in Mountain View about 34 miles away from the incident.         The protest organized by an advocacy group called Heart of the City took aim at private commuter buses which whisk thousands of employees from stops around San Francisco to jobs at technology companies south of the city including Facebook and Apple.         Advocates of the buses say they ease traffic on already clogged highways as workers give up driving individual cars for the convenience of riding in the buses which usually come with plush seats and Internet access.         Foes say the buses jam up municipal bus stops and remove potential customers from cash-strapped public transportation systems including regional rail service that could use their revenue.         BREAKING: Protesters halt and block  @google  bus protesting San Francisco evictions  #ows   pic.twitter.com/LRPwPIrwhx The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency is proposing a set of rules around commuter buses and the use of public bus stops Paul Rose a spokesman for the agency said via email.         åÛåÏThe proposed policy balances the need to minimize impacts on Muni with the benefits that shuttles provide by taking thousands of cars off the streetåÛå Rose said. The agency plans to present the proposal to its board in January. If approved a pilot test will go into affect in the summer he added.         åÛåÏWe certainly donåÛåªt want to cause any inconvenience to San Francisco residents and we and others in our industry are working with the transportation agency to agree on a policy on shuttles in the cityåÛå a Google spokeswoman said.         Bemused Google workers spent about a half hour sitting on the bus until the protesters disbanded many of the workers sending Tweets about the incident.         åÛåÏMy shuttle came under siege this morningåÛå tweeted Alejandro Villarreal who attached a photo of the scene as it appeared through the bus window. VillarrealåÛåªs LinkedIn profile identifies him as a program manager at Google.         My shuttle came under siege this morning.  #Googleproblems ?  http://t.co/3fJmq6prvh åÛåÏDonåÛåªt hate on me for my jobåÛå tweeted @FashionistaLab whose Twitter description identifies her as a style editor at Google Shopping. åÛåÏYou think I LIKE commuting to Mountain View? This protest is dumb.åÛå         I agree with you that SF isn't for sale but don't hate on me for my job. You think I LIKE commuting to Mountain View? this protest is dumb. A man who screamed at protest organizer Erin McElroy 31 was later identified as a union worker who was pretending to be a Google employee upset at being delayed by the protest.         A verbal altercation which was reported to be a hoax outside of the Google shuttle. Increasingly graffiti has appeared around town complaining about the buses.         åÛåÏGoogle scumåÛå read one notice pasted to a light controller at the corner of South Van Ness Street a major artery for the commuter buses photographed by local resident George Lipp on Sunday. åÛåÏKeep catching your busåÛå read a notice on the other side of the light controller.         The commuter-bus situation åÛåÏhas become very symbolic of whatåÛåªs happening to the city in terms of gentrificationåÛå said McElroy in a phone interview. åÛåÏItåÛåªs creating a system where San Francisco is being flooded with capital and creating a technology class where other people canåÛåªt compete.åÛå         Heart of the City is planning a demonstration on Tuesday against a developer that plans to evict residents from rent-controlled apartments she added. The total number of evictions jumped 25 percent to 1716 in the 12 months ending in February 2013 according to a report by San FranciscoåÛåªs budget and legislative analyst despite strong tenant-protection laws.         San Francisco protests against gentrification and evictions have occurred with growing frequency in recent months. Last month  TwitteråÛåªs initial public offering sparked a demonstration  outside its headquarters.         Many residents feel left out of the technology boom and blame it for rising rents.         The median rent on a two-bedroom apartment rose 10 percent over the last year to $3250 more than any other city in the country according to online real estate company Trulia. Rents in greater New York rose just 2.8 percent         The current situation evokes the late 1990s when a slew of small Web start-ups popped up throughout the city causing tensions over rising rents and traffic.

But it is fair to say that Lin has earned at the expense of his former team and its impetuous owner a well-timed chortle.         Ever the spiritual man Lin reflecting on what now appears to be a prosperous relocation from New York to Houston said åÛåÏI do believe God has the perfect plan.åÛå As it turns out the fast-track building strategy hatched a couple of years ago by Daryl Morey the  Rockets åÛåª general manager was not so bad either.         Two nights after scoring 31 points off the bench Lin started and rang up 34 points and 12 assists but he and the Rockets without James Harden wilted late and dropped  a 123-117 overtime decision  to the 76ers on Wednesday night at Wells Fargo Center. Next stop: Madison Square Garden on Thursday night for an appointment with the  Knicks .         With Lin as HoustonåÛåªs premier offensive threat Wednesday the Rockets looked like what they were supposed to be when the Knicks let him go as a free agent in the summer of 2012. Lin said that when he signed with Houston he did not expect that Harden and  Dwight Howard  would be his teammates.         But Morey traded for Harden and lured the Kobe Bryant-averse Howard as a free agent quickly giving Lin a better developmental environment than he would have had as the leading man åÛåÓ or for that matter as a  Carmelo Anthony  running mate with the soap opera that is the Knicks.         After the Knicks owner James L. Dolan refused to match MoreyåÛåªs upgraded offer sheet remember how LinåÛåªs detractors in New York ridiculed him for consigning himself to be the counterfeit marquee player on a dreadful team?         åÛåÏTheyåÛåªve done a great job on this team of surrounding us with really good playersåÛå he said. åÛåÏItåÛåªs definitely an adjustment but IåÛåªm just so thankful every day I get to play. Two years ago I was just trying to make it; 15th man didnåÛåªt matter to me just as long as I was on the team. I always try to take a step back from the journey and see the bigger picture.åÛå         That was what Dolan and the Knicks claimed they were doing when they let a young asset and one of the most marketable players in team history wander off without getting so much as a draft pick in return.         Many critics one of whom was named Carmelo chanted the organizationåÛåªs mantra that agreeing to a $25 million deal with a luxury-tax-burdensome $14.9 million balloon payment in its third and final year would have been Linsanity. But raise your hand if you think the Knicks could use an aggressive guard who is averaging 18.1 points on 54.2 percent shooting (51 percent on 3-pointers after making 9 of 15 against the 76ers) and 4.9 assists per game.         Averaging 34.3 minutes a game Lin has a shooting percentage that is a shade better than HowardåÛåªs and most of HowardåÛåªs points are scored with his hands fastened to the rim.         åÛåÏWhen he plays with confidence heåÛåªs amazingåÛå said Howard who spent part of the summer working out with Lin in Colorado.         It is too early in the season to make too much of statistics or standings and no one is about to anoint the 5-4 Rockets as N.B.A. champions. Their defense åÛåÓ LinåÛåªs included åÛåÓ tends to be on the generous side. But they have youth talent and upside like Lin.         åÛåÏI think heåÛåªs playing better right now for us than at any point last yearåÛå Coach Kevin McHale said. åÛåÏHeåÛåªs attacking; heåÛåªs confident. He put a big summer of work in. His shot is better. He is better.åÛå         Without Harden to lean on Lin appeared to tire down the stretch and committed eight turnovers over all. åÛåÏNormally I relish the fourth quarteråÛå he said later. His statistical line was reminiscent of the Garden-variety Linsanity. But his turnovers were mostly errors of commission the results of trying to do too much.         He is of course only 25 and learning his trade.         åÛåÏThis might sound crazy but I still think itåÛåªs early for me in my development phase or whatever you want to call itåÛå he said.         How did the Knicks make the shortsighted call on a player who had already succeeded way beyond what pro basketball sleuths could imagine for Lin at Harvard åÛåÓ and one who seemed like a good bet to continue working at his craft?         åÛåÏI thought if any team knew what it had it was going to be New YorkåÛå Morey said. åÛåÏAt the time we had nobody on our roster with All-Star potential. We thought: åÛå÷O.K. heåÛåªs not an All-Star but he played like one for 30 games. So take a chance.åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå         Had Dolan reasoned that Lin as an Asian-American sensation was probably worth $2 in commercial appeal for every $1 he was paid Lin would still be trying to figure out how to play with Anthony.         Harden like Anthony is known to monopolize the ball. Hence McHaleåÛåªs recent experimenting with Lin as a second-unit scorer playing first-unit minutes until Harden sat with a minor foot injury Wednesday night.         åÛåÏMe and James still play a lot together but they still want me to be aggressive the primary ball handler off the benchåÛå Lin said. åÛåÏThereåÛåªs still chemistry problems åÛåÓ not like problems just things weåÛåªre trying to get better. No personality issues.åÛå         Thanks to certain Garden personalities one of the great New York basketball yarns took a wrong turn and wound up in Texas. Long-suffering and implausibly loyal Knicks fans were stiffed again after what felt like a rare homegrown happening at the Garden.         Understand that this has worked out better for Lin who does not think his second return to New York should be a big deal in the context of who will be with him. Calling Harden and Howard åÛåÏthe faces of the franchiseåÛå he added åÛåÏIåÛåªm hoping IåÛåªll be a subplot.åÛå         Chortle chortle.

The leftist Social Democrats winners by a slim margin of an October parliamentary election are looking to return to government for the first time since 2006 in a coalition with the centrist ANO movement and the Christian Democrats.         Tax policy had been the main sticking point in coalition talks with ANO founded two years ago by billionaire businessman Andrej Babis opposed to higher taxes.         ""It is definitely done. We have agreed on controversial areas that have lingered until now"" Bohuslav Sobotka the Social Democratic party chairman and likely next prime minister said after talks with the parties that lasted more than five hours.         Sobotka and the deputy leaders of the other two parties said the parties would give final details of their coalition agreement later in the week when they unveil their program.         Sobotka said some tax changes could come in 2015.         The parties have aimed to wrap up coalition talks in the next week so that Sobotka could present his government to President Milos Zeman by the end of the year.         Anti-corruption movement ANO's opposition to tax rises has pushed the Social Democrats to back off plans for now to lift taxes for banks telecommunications companies and utilities to boost budget revenue. Sobotka said the question of a so-called sector tax was addressed in the coalition deal but did not give further details.         ""For us it is important that we will create tax stability in our country for the next four years and that we will begin to function as the new government"" ANO deputy leader Jaroslav Faltynek said.         ANO surged in the polls this autumn and finished a strong second in the October vote winning voters that had in the past supported more established center-right parties.         A center-right government collapsed in June following a bribery and spying scandal.

Appearing in court in brown prison fatigues Abu Qatada said the presence of a military judge in the panel of three violated the agreement under which he was flown back to Jordan in July after many years of legal battles in Britain.         The Islamist cleric had already been sentenced in absentia by a Jordanian court to life imprisonment for conspiracy to carry out al Qaeda-style attacks against U.S. and other targets inside Jordan.         He is now being retried with the prosecution arguing he was a mentor to jihadist cells in Jordan while he was in Britain providing both spiritual and material support to a campaign of violence during the late 1990s inside Jordan whose pro-Western policies made it an al Qaeda target.         ""I have been prevented from defending myself for a long period and God knows that I am innocent"" said Abu Qatada saying that the charges against him were fabricated.         ""There has been a betrayal of the agreement under which I have come. There is now a military judge...I have come to be tried by civilian judges.""         ""This court is a betrayal of the agreement and I don't recognize it"" said Abu Qatada whose real name is Mahmoud Othman.         His lawyer Ghazi Thuneibat called for Abu Qatada's release saying his rights had been violated by the presence of the military judge and reliance on evidence that was extracted under torture from other defendants.         ""LEGAL ASSURANCES""         Past attempts to extradite Abu Qatada were hampered by concern that evidence to be used in Jordan may have been obtained through torture making his deportation illegal under the European Convention on Human Rights.         A legal deal signed by Jordan and Britain last April included guarantees against the use of such evidence. That along with a European court ruling had persuaded Abu Qatada to return to Jordan Thuneibat said.         ""My client came to Jordan on the legal assurances by the highest court in Europe that use of evidence obtained through torture will not be used in this retrial. These (EU) court decisions overrule national laws"" the lawyer said.         ""These confessions were given under torture and so using them in a retrial makes this an unjust trial"" he said.         Prosecutor Colonel Fawaz al-Atoum said he rejected foreign judicial rulings that challenge the operations of the state security court.         ""The Jordanian constitution rises above any other laws or agreements"" Atoum said in apparent reference to the EU court.         Jordanian officials who deny confessions were extracted under torture have pledged a fair trial for Abu Qatada.         The military tribunals have been criticized by international human rights organizations which have called for their abolition and for civilians to face trial in civilian courts.         Linked by a Spanish judge to the late al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden Abu Qatada was in and out of jail in Britain since first being arrested in 2001. He was sent back to prison last March for breaching his bail conditions.         Jordanian security officials and experts on Islamist radical groups say Abu Qatada's ideological writings have influenced many Qaeda youths.         Sermons of the heavily bearded Abu Qatada were found in a Hamburg flat used by some of those who carried out the September 11 2001 attacks on the United States.         In 2005 al Qaeda claimed responsibility for three suicide bombings that ripped through luxury hotels in Jordan's capital killing dozens of people.         Jordanian authorities have arrested scores of hardline Islamists in recent months along its border with Syria as they were about to cross the frontier to join jihadist groups fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

European companies with the technology to fully exploit Iran's vast South Pars field under the Gulf abandoned it in the late 2000s under U.S. pressure dashing its hopes of following Qatar's meteoric rise up the global gas exporters' league.         Last month's nuclear deal between the West and the new Iranian government has ignited hopes that its  oil  production could bounce back if Washington and the European Union relax controls on exports.         But Iran has little chance of becoming a significant gas exporter for at least a decade because of high domestic demand and internal obstacles to developing reserves which were a problem long before sanctions forced foreigners out.         The lifting of sanctions on Iran ""could potentially have a huge impact on exports over the longer term but it will take years for things to get moving"" Laurent Ruseckas senior adviser on the Global Gas team at consultants IHS said.         In the short term it makes more economic sense for Iran to use gas to satisfy domestic demand for power generation and industry and for re-injection into ageing oilfields to maintain production Ruseckas said.         Oilfield re-injection is a higher-value use for gas than exports because oil sells for much more on the global market and does not require billions of dollars in capital investment in gas export projects that take years to pay back.         Over 1 trillion cubic feet (tcf) or over 28 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas was re-injected to help boost oil production in 2011 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration and some estimates indicate that over 8 bcf/d (around 83 bcm/year) will be needed within a decade.         NET IMPORTER         Iran's marketed gas production excluding flared and reinjected gas has more than doubled to 160.5 bcm in 2012 from 75 bcm in 2002.         But Tehran has looked on while Qatar has become one of the world's richest countries after western energy companies built multi-billion dollar plants over the last decade that turned the tiny Gulf state into the world's largest liquefied  natural gas  (LNG) exporter.         The two countries share the world's largest gas field which Iran calls South Pars and Qatar the North Field. It straddles their offshore Gulf border and accounts for nearly all of Qatar's gas production and around 35 percent of Iran's.         An abundance of condensate and natural gas liquids in the field means it can produce enough income to cover drilling costs before pumping out gas. That makes Iranian LNG export projects potentially highly competitive even as supply swells due to U.S. shale gas and big finds off East Africa.         Phase 12 of the South Pars development which is expected to start up next year could boost supplies by as much as 28 bcm/year when it is fully operational.         ""We have to make efforts to launch a section of this phase as soon as possible"" Iran's oil and gas minister Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying by ministry website Shana during a recent visit to the sites. ""Important petroleum industry projects must not be delayed due to waiting for the lifting of sanctions.""         According to figures from the Pars Oil and Gas Company which manages the whole project phases 13 to 24 could add up to 142 bcm/year of capacity by 2019 if completed on time.         Iran already produces more gas than Qatar. The difference is that Qatar with a population of less than 2 million uses just 26 bcm of it leaving 125 bcm free for export according to data from BP.         Iran has used nearly all the gas it produces to supply its 77 million people with heat electricity and fuel. Domestic demand has risen to 156 bcm in 2012 from 79 bcm in 2002 according to BP figures which exclude gas used for re-injection.         Even if its domestic consumption rises at only the half annual growth rate seen over the past decade that implies increases of 8-9 bcm every year over the next five years. That would take Iran's gas consumption to around 200 bcm/year in 2018 not counting its rising use for re-injection.         Iran has been a net importer for most of the past decade and this year asked Turkmenistan for more supplies to help ease shortages that are forcing Iranian power plants to burn billions of dollars of pricey and polluting oil products.

We are confused. Many people have the gnawing feeling that åÛåÏnothingåÛå is fit safe wise or ethical to eat and the  $61 billion diet industry  encourages us to dwell on this uncertainty. We buy too much of the wrong stuff because it is affordable satisfying plentiful and aggressively marketed. Then we seek the cure for what that toxic regimen causes. ItåÛåªs a dizzying merry-go-round.         ThereåÛåªs no question that the safety thing is confounding and itåÛåªs not something individuals can do much about: You can avoid some chemicals by eating organic food but thatåÛåªs not an option for everyone. Besides even that doesnåÛåªt address issues involving heavy metals or salmonella or god knows what else in our food supply. These are environmental problems and one governmental responsibility on which everyone ought to agree is that environmental problems should be regulated until theyåÛåªre solved.         But nutrition advice need not confound; in fact itåÛåªs simple and has barely changed since you were a kid (it doesnåÛåªt even matter when you were a kid). åÛåÏEat a variety of foodsåÛå almost does the trick if the foods youåÛåªre eating are real which means food with one ingredient or maybe four or six. (Most real bread for example is water flour yeast and salt with the possible addition of olive oil or a seasoning or two and the possible subtraction of yeast. Yeast conditioners and ingredients with five syllables have no place in real bread.)         I asked Marion Nestle who is among the wisest and sanest people I know when it comes to nutrition how she might sum up dietary advice and after noting that not much has changed since the åÛå÷50s she said: åÛåÏThe basic principles åÛåÓ then and now åÛåÓ are variety (eat many different kinds of foods to get all needed nutrients) balance (donåÛåªt eat too much of any one food category especially meat dairy and junk foods) and moderation (balance calories). To these we can add: Eat more fruits and vegetables.åÛå         Some of this requires judgment but itåÛåªs safe to say that the less junk food (especially sugar and the like) and the more fruits and veggies you eat the better off you are. We needlessly complicate things when we think about åÛåÏnutrientsåÛå rather than åÛåÏfoodsåÛå and we often take rigid extreme positions.         It was health warnings about cholesterol and fat that set off the low-fat high-processed-carb craze which led pretty much directly to the current obesity crisis. Indeed if the nutrition advice of the åÛå÷70s and åÛå÷80s had been åÛåÏeat most things in moderation and donåÛåªt eat too much junkåÛå many pounds would have remained ungained. Instead we were told to eat low-fat foods and  we downed SnackwellåÛåªs  as if they were health food. VoilÌÄåÊ.         When food is deconstructed into åÛåÏnutrientsåÛå and we start worrying about how much oat bran or how little saturated fat we eat we play a losing game one that gives the marketers of processed foods åÛåÓ a very high percentage of which is not food at all åÛåÓ the opportunity to sell high-oat-bran or low-saturated-fat products as åÛåÏhealthyåÛå regardless of their other properties.         Thus one purpose of åÛåÏmarketingåÛå is åÛåÏconfusingåÛå trying to persuade us that we must know a lot to make intelligent food choices. But little research on individual nutrients is conclusive. All you need really worry about is whether what youåÛåªre eating is actually food and if youåÛåªre eating too much of one type or simply too much. Except again fruits vegetables and other minimally processed plants of which youåÛåªd have a hard time eating too much.         Which brings us to the extremism thing. On one end of the spectrum is the typical American diet which is extreme in its contribution to chronic disease environmental degradation animal cruelty and we might add setting a bad example. (IåÛåªm determinedly avoiding numbers in this column but if you want a whole bunch of them at once  lookie here .)         So we flee to the other end and deify veganism now in the news every time someone famous announces theyåÛåªve åÛåÏgoneåÛå vegan. The latest is that  Al Gore  has joined Bill Clinton in animal-free land though there are the inevitable reports that  maybe Clinton cheats . (Not that thereåÛåªs anything wrong with that.) Gore presumably finally recognized that the typical American diet of something like 600 pounds of animal products a year is inconsistent with a progressive or even realistic view of slowing global warming. Or maybe he just wanted to lose some weight. Or both åÛåÓ he didnåÛåªt respond when I emailed him.         ThereåÛåªs never any press when people simply decide to eat less junk food or more plants or less meat yet both anecdotal and sales evidence show that meat consumption is down significantly in the United States. And yet itåÛåªs the simple advice åÛåÓ the eat less meat and junk eat more plants åÛåÓ thatåÛåªs going to make the biggest difference because not only will more doctors and other advice-givers preach it but more people will also be able to heed it. Not likely true of veganism.         Besides thereåÛåªs no guarantee that eschewing animal products will give you a healthy diet; itåÛåªll just give you a diet without animal products. (Jelly Bellys Coke and fries are all vegan.) ItåÛåªs true that veganism is an ethical response to the worldåÛåªs food problems (feed less to animals and more to people) and itåÛåªs obviously the only response if you donåÛåªt want to kill animals to eat them ever.         But there is logic to integrating animals into the agricultural landscape (Simon Fairlie  makes that argument very well ) and there is nutritional logic to eating some animal products.         Where thereåÛåªs no logic is in maintaining the status quo. I have no beef (forgive me) with vegans; in fact anyone who argues for a greater proportion of real plants in the diet is arguing for part-time veganism. But you donåÛåªt need to go to the opposite end of the spectrum to avoid the standard American diet; you just need to follow the advice you already know.

School shutdowns and deteriorating results have taken the shine off an education model admired and emulated around the world in Britain in particular.         ""I think we have had too much blind faith in that more private schools would guarantee greater educational quality"" said Tomas TobÌÄå© head of the parliament's education committee and spokesman on education for the ruling Moderate party.         In a country with the fastest growing economic inequality of any OECD nation basic aspects of the deregulated school market are now being re-considered raising questions over private sector involvement in other areas like health.         Two-decades into its free-market experiment about a quarter of once staunchly Socialist Sweden's secondary school students now attend publically-funded but privately run schools almost twice the global average.         Nearly half of those study at schools fully or partly owned by private equity firms.         Ahead of elections next year politicians of all stripes are questioning the role of such firms accused of putting profits first with practices like letting students decide when they have learned enough and keeping no record of their grades.         The opposition Green Party - like the Moderates long-time supporters of privately run schools but now backing the clamp-down - issued a public apology in a Swedish daily last month headlined ""Forgive us our policy led our schools astray"".         CAUTIONARY TALE         In the early 1990's parents were given tax-funded vouchers to pay for a school of their choice. Private schools were allowed for the first time and could even turn a profit.         Britain has taken on board many feature of the system although it has stopped short of allowing publically-funded schools to make a profit and Swedish school corporations have expanded as far afield as India.         This year's demise of JB Education owned by Danish private equity firm Axcel was the biggest but not the only bankruptcy in Sweden's reformed education sector.         It stripped almost 1000 staff of their jobs and left more than 1 billion crowns ($150 million) of debts mainly to banks and suppliers as well as abandoning its students.         ""I was furious"" said Margarete Grugel 56 whose 16-year-old daughter Tina had one week left of her first term of a hair styling course at the JB school in Jonkoping when it folded.         ""Tina was absolutely shattered by it.""         Axcel acknowledges mistakes were made.         ""Of course we could have been better at managing the schools"" senior communication advisor Joachim Sperling said.         ""Many of the schools were in bad shape and even though we knew that from the start we did not manage to deal with the challenges in due time.""         It is a cautionary tale in a market estimated to have been worth more than $400 billion worldwide in a 2010 report by the International Finance Corporation.         With annual turnover in Sweden of roughly 20 billion crowns ($3 billion) according to a recent parliamentary study education should be an attractive prospect.         But while some of the early players sold quickly at a profit nowadays it is no cash cow.         One in four secondary schools is lossmaking and since 2008 the risk of insolvency has shot up 188 percent and is 25 percent above the average for Swedish corporations said UC a business and credit information firm.         ""Few sectors can show as bad figures as this"" it said.         Part of the problem stems from demographics with overall secondary school numbers in sharp decline since 2008 and unlikely to recover to the past peak for a generation or more.         A lax regulatory environment is also to blame.         Sweden replaced one of the world's most tightly regulated school systems with one of the most deregulated leading to scandals like the 2011 case of the convicted pedophile who set up several schools quite legally.         ""I've often said it's been easier to start an independent school than set up a hot-dog stand"" said Eva-Lis Siren head of Lararforbundet Sweden's biggest teachers union.

If there was consensus among the justices it concerned only the complexity and difficulty of the issues before them.         åÛåÏThis is a tough problemåÛå Justice Stephen G. Breyer said. A few minutes later Justice Elena Kagan offered a similar assessment. åÛåÏThis is a hard problemåÛå she said.         Still the questioning suggested that there may well be five votes to sustain the Environmental Protection Agency regulations at issue. åÛåÏItåÛåªs certainly hardåÛå Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said of the task of allocating responsibility åÛåÏbut it is what the statute says and it seems to me that if E.P.A. had taken a different view it would have been contrary to the statute.åÛå         Justice Anthony M. Kennedy also asked questions suggesting support for the regulations. åÛåÏIt seems to me that in some respects the E.P.A. is more constrained under this process to which you objectåÛå he told Jonathan F. Mitchell the solicitor general of Texas who represented 14 states challenging the rules.         The agencyåÛåªs approach which involves a trading system for pollution credits  was struck down last year  in a  2-to-1 ruling  from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The appeals court said the agency had exceeded its authority under the Clean Air Act in the way it apportioned the cleanup work among 28 upwind states.         The air in those states mostly in the Midwest and the South may meet regulatory standards within their borders even as pollutants from their power plants and refineries drift across state lines preventing neighboring states from meeting their legal obligations. The affected states are largely in the Northeast and the mid-Atlantic.         The regulation at issue the  Cross-State Air Pollution Rule  sometimes called the transport rule did not apportion reductions by the amount of pollution contributed by each upwind state. Instead the agency sought to encourage remedial action where it was cheapest.         The appeals court said that this approach violated the Clean Air ActåÛåªs åÛåÏgood neighboråÛå provision by requiring upwind states åÛåÏto reduce their emissions by more than their own significant contributionåÛå to downwind pollution.         Much of TuesdayåÛåªs arguments concerned whether the agency could take cost into account or whether as Justice Kagan put it åÛåÏCongress has demanded that the regulation occur in a fundamentally silly way.åÛå         Justice Antonin Scalia said that cost-based regulations might be wise policy åÛåÏbut itåÛåªs certainly not the statute that Congress wrote.åÛå         Peter D. Keisler a lawyer for industry and labor groups challenging the regulations said they were flawed because åÛåÏthere is no relationship at all under the E.P.A.åÛåªs methodology between the amount a state contributes and the amount it has to reduce.åÛå         Justice Kagan responded that the agency had taken a sensible approach. åÛåÏWhat the E.P.A. said here was åÛå÷WeåÛåªre going to distinguish between states that have put a lot of technology and a lot of money into this already and on the other hand states that have lots of cheap and dirty emissions.åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå         The agency has said that exposure to ozone and fine particles was responsible for one in 20 deaths in the United States 200000 nonfatal heart attacks 90000 hospital admissions and 2.5 million cases of aggravated asthma among children.         The appeals court also overturned the regulation on a second ground saying it was flawed because it did not let the states submit their own plans to comply.         In its  Supreme Court brief  the environmental agency said the complexity of the problem justified its approach. åÛåÏThe interstate pollution problem is best understoodåÛå the brief said åÛåÏas a dense spaghetti-like matrix of overlapping upwind/downwind åÛå÷linkagesåÛåª among many states rather than a neater and more limited set of linkages among just a few.åÛå         Chief Justice Roberts said Tuesday that the matrix analogy meant there was no way for åÛåÏthe state to know how much of a burden you expect them to address.åÛå         Malcolm L. Stewart a deputy solicitor general representing the environmental agency seemed to engage the court by asking what the phrase åÛåÏcontributes significantlyåÛå used in the Clean Air Act might mean to a basketball coach who had just lost a game.         Chief Justice Roberts appeared taken by the idea saying åÛåÏIf you ask the coach what significantly contributed to the loss heåÛåªs going to talk about the missed layup rather than the missed desperation throw even though as far as amount each was going to count for two points.åÛå         Mr. Keisler declined to talk about basketball. But Justice Scalia said that every point in a game has the same value.         The argument lasted 90 minutes instead of the usual hour. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. disqualified himself presumably over a financial conflict. That left open the possibility of a 4-4 tie in the case Environmental Protection Agency v. EME Homer City Generation No. 12-1182. A tie would leave the decision of the appeals court in place.         Also Tuesday the court dismissed a case that could have resolved a dispute among the lower courts on deals in which employers aid unionization drives in exchange for labor peace called åÛåÏneutrality agreements.åÛå The federal appeals court in Atlanta  ruled  that such deals can run afoul of a federal labor law that bars employers from giving a åÛåÏthing of valueåÛå to unions.         The courtåÛåªs unsigned one-sentence  decision  in the case Unite Here Local 355 v. Mulhall No. 12-99 gave no explanation for the dismissal which followed  an oral argument  last month.         In a dissent Justice Stephen G. Breyer said questions had arisen about whether the case was moot and whether the worker who brought the suit had suffered the sort of injury that gave him standing to sue. Justice Breyer who was joined by Justices Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor said the court should have asked for further briefs rather than dismiss the case and leave in place an appeals court decision that åÛåÏcould negatively affect the collective-bargaining process.åÛå

While praised by the Republican leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives including Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor the agreement faces a challenge from some House conservatives and will require support of the minority Democrats to pass.         The backing of President Barack Obama who also hailed the agreement as ""a good first step"" should help round up votes of his fellow Democrats. He urged Congress to quickly pass it.         Obama and most congressional leaders long ago abandoned talk of larger but increasingly elusive ""grand bargains"" that would significantly slash the nation's deficit.         Democratic Senator Patty Murray and Republican Representative Paul Ryan who appeared before reporters Tuesday evening to announce the $85 billion budget accord portrayed it as the beginning of a new era.         ""For far too long compromise has been considered a dirty word"" said Murray chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee adding that the uncertainty created by three solid years of Washington bickering ""was devastating to our economic recovery.""         Ryan the Republican Party's 2012 failed vice presidential candidate who has his eye on either a 2016 presidential campaign or potentially a House leadership post wasted no time in trying to blunt criticism of the pact especially from fellow conservatives.         ""In divided government you don't always get what you want"" said Ryan chairman of the House Budget Committee         But he added ""I think this agreement is a clear improvement on the status quo. This agreement makes sure that we don't have a government shutdown scenario in January. It makes sure we don't have another government shutdown scenario in October. It makes sure that we don't lurch from crisis to crisis.""         Over the last two days conservative groups including Americans for Prosperity and Heritage Action for America blasted the deal as it was being negotiated and called on Republicans to reject it.         Such groups hold sway with some House Republicans and with the 2014 congressional elections coming into focus their opposition could complicate its passage.         The Ryan-Murray plan would blunt the effect of automatic ""sequester"" spending cuts by allowing federal agencies and discretionary programs to spend $63 billion more over two years while savings are made elsewhere. It also would provide an additional $20 billion to $23 billion in deficit reduction over 10 years.         While the measure could improve Congress' ability to pass must-do bills to keep the government running many saw this as marking an end to any chance of Washington enacting a major new deficit-reduction law anytime soon.         ""I've given up on grand bargain. There's not going to be a big grand bargain with (this) Senate and president. That just is not going to happen"" said Republican Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma.         Republican Senator Marco Rubio who could compete against Ryan in a 2016 White House bid blasted the deal saying ""This budget continues Washington's irresponsible budgeting decisions by spending more money than the government takes in and placing additional financial burdens on everyday Americans.""         SIDESTEPPING TOUGH ISSUES         The accord was uncharacteristic for a politically polarized Congress that in recent years has waited until the absolute last moments to reach stop-gap agreements on the budget and on raising U.S. borrowing limits to avert historic debt defaults.         Instead Ryan and Murray came to a handshake before a non-binding Friday deadline and more than a month before the January 15 date when existing funds to run many federal programs expire.         Their work was made easier by the simple fact that they avoided most of their parties' biggest disagreements in budget debates: the future of big retirement and healthcare programs that Republicans want to cut and the closing of tax loopholes that benefit the rich which Democrats want to attack.         The House is likely to put the deal to a vote by Friday before recessing for the year and a Senate vote might come next week.         Boehner who as the House speaker was at the center of bitter budget fights with Obama in 2011 2012 and 2013 said: ""While modest in scale this agreement represents a positive step forward"" that he added would further cut budget deficits without tax hikes.         While it included no tax increases in a strict sense the Murray-Ryan proposal would cost consumers some money as in higher  airport security  fees that would be included in airplane ticket purchases.         Among the details of the bill are $6 billion in cuts to federal workers' retirement benefits and $6 billion in cuts to military pensions according to Murray.         These and other new savings would replace some of the second round of automatic spending cuts known as ""sequestration"" that were scheduled to begin in January.         Murray and other leading Democrats have been pushing for an extension of federal jobless benefits that expire later this month during weeks of budget negotiations.         She told reporters that such a provision is not part of the agreement but is being discussed by congressional leaders.         Also not addressed in this budget deal is the need to again raise U.S. borrowing authority sometime next year.         The reaction from at least one market-watcher was positive. ""It is certainly a good start to what would be welcomed relief from the fiscal dysfunction that has defined Washington"" said Craig Dismuke chief economic strategist at Vining Sparks in Memphis.

The other is the subway systemåÛåªs forgotten shame cast in blue spray paint and corrugated metal then suspended in disrepair since the grime-and-graffiti era of the 1970s when it served a neighborhood in Brooklyn that bears little resemblance to todayåÛåªs.         There are more than a few stations hidden in the cityåÛåªs underground thickets but none offer more contrasting images of New YorkåÛåªs past than these two: Old City Hall Station the flagship of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the lower level at Bergen Street last seen widely as the backdrop of a horror film.         Now for equally divergent reasons involving train turnarounds and the vicissitudes of repair both can be glimpsed for those who know where to look. The first case is deliberate: The  Metropolitan Transportation Authority  has in recent years begun allowing riders to stay on the No. 6 train as it turns around at the southern end of its run. The second is not. In the last several months planned and unplanned work on the Culver Line in Brooklyn has often rerouted F trains to the old express tracks that pass below Cobble Hill.         Among history-minded riders the stations have for decades stood as emblems of the transit systemåÛåªs dueling legacies. They are the impossible standard and the indelible blight åÛåÓ the reason todayåÛåªs wistful older riders can be sorted into two camps: those for whom hindsight has softened the edges of the subwayåÛåªs darkest days and the dwindling few with memories long enough to include its most regal beginnings.         The stations are particularly striking because they can be glimpsed almost accidentally by a straggler who overslept on the Lexington Avenue line waking to discover a turn-of-the-century gem on the loop track at Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall or by a commuter aboard a surprise express to Manhattan.         For such F train riders there is the dash past the outdoor stations at Fourth Avenue and Smith-Ninth Street then the telltale dip at Carroll Street as the platform recedes overhead.         And then it appears faintly at first followed by two surges of light: the moldering columns a staircase leading to a dim concourse and walls of graffiti åÛåÓ some fresh some apparently decades old. The station was closed to passengers in 1976.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs sort of a window back into that time when the subway system was different and not nearly as safeåÛå said Benjamin Kabak the publisher of the website  Second Ave. Sagas  who recently passed the old station during a spell of weekend work on the F. åÛåÏIt looked like the train could stop and let people on right now.åÛå         But few chapters from the systemåÛåªs past so rankle the transportation authority which declined to discuss the station in detail. For one the authority is mindful of persistent calls to restore F express service in Brooklyn fearing that any mention of the station might convince riders that it could be renovated adequately. Officials also noted security concerns and a desire to åÛåÏdiscourage urban explorersåÛå from venturing underground.         At City Hall though a sense of adventure is celebrated. On the authorityåÛåªs website  members of the New York Transit Museum are encouraged  to buy $40 tickets for a tour of the station referred to by its nickname åÛåÏthe Jewel in the Crown.åÛå There are two sessions in December.         For the 100th anniversary of the subway system in 2004 the station which was closed in 1945 because its platforms could not accommodate 10-car trains was reopened for a ceremony with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Workers dressed in turn-of-the-century outfits as Mr. Bloomberg helped maneuver a vintage four-car train.         Less elaborate outings have also been condoned. Though conductors were in the past known to expel passengers at the end of the No. 6 line announcements on many trains have been adjusted to reflect a change. åÛåÏThe next stop on this train will be Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall on the uptown platformåÛå the message now says in a nod to riders who might remain on board. The cost for them of course is that of a single ride.         Even the pace of the train is cooperative at least compared with the express-powered blur past Bergen Street. A recent unhurried rumble through the loop revealed the skylights the faience signs the arched entryway illuminated by six temporary bulbs.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs a salute to an era when subways were meant to enhance the quality of life in the cityåÛå said Gene Russianoff a longtime transit advocate for the Straphangers Campaign. åÛåÏI guess they do now but not with beautiful stations.åÛå         On a recent afternoon Bersio Pupo 46 and Yara Noronha 31 visiting from Brazil said they had come to the station after seeing images of it in a book of photographs. It reminded them of  EstaÌÄå¤ÌÄå£o da Luz in SÌÄå£o Paulo .         But it is possible that todayåÛåªs Bergen Street guests have the stronger grasp of the systemåÛåªs past. One veteran graffiti writer who requested anonymity because he is not allowed to traverse the tunnels said he had visited the lower level three times in recent years to take in the art and add his own. åÛåÏThe people who end up there are usually people who know their historyåÛå he said.         The Brooklyn station received perhaps its widest exposure in 1990 as the setting of a scene in  åÛåÏJacobåÛåªs LadderåÛå starring Tim Robbins  as a troubled Vietnam War veteran. That is thought to be perhaps the last time the station was opened for anyone besides transit personnel.         Adrian Lyne the filmåÛåªs director said in a phone interview that the hub had thrived in its supporting role. åÛåÏIt worked very well for meåÛå he recalled. åÛåÏItåÛåªs a rather ghostly place.åÛå

The youngest heavyweight champion of the world at the age of 20 in 1986 Mr. Tyson would become as famous for his run-ins with the law and the wretched excess of his lifestyle as he was once feared and revered for his boxing prowess.         Mr. TysonåÛåªs new memoir åÛåÏUndisputed TruthåÛå written with Larry Sloman is a splashy hodgepodge of a book by turns exhausting and fascinating self-pitying and candid. Parts of it read like a real-life Tarantino movie. Parts read like a Tom Wolfe-ian tour of wildly divergent worlds: from the slums of Brooklyn to the high life in Las Vegas to the isolation of prison. And parts read like transcripts from a marathon therapy session in dire need of editing.         The book shares the title of Mr. TysonåÛåªs one-man stage show (HBO has been showing a filmed version) but in terms of raw emotion and psychological drama the volume has more in common with James TobackåÛåªs powerful 2008 documentary åÛåÏTysonåÛå which was based on hours of taped interviews with its subject. Mr. TysonåÛåªs idiosyncratic voice comes through clearly on the page here åÛåÓ not just his mix of profane street talk and 12-step recovery language cinematic descriptions of individual fights and philosophical musings but also his biting humor and fondness for literary and historical references that run the gamut from Alexandre Dumas to Tolstoy to Lenin to Tennessee Williams.         Mr. Tyson gives us earnest efforts to make sense of the crazy extremes of his life; angry pull-no-punches portraits of people he feels victimized by (like the boxing promoter Don King whom he describes as åÛåÏa wretched slimy reptilianåÛå guy who åÛåÏcontaminated my whole barometeråÛå) and colorful descriptions of the åÛåÏbling-blingåÛå life he led at the height of his fame including a Las Vegas mansion furnished in everything Versace and with a pool åÛåÏringed with seven-foot statues of fierce warriors like Alexander the Great Hannibal Genghis Khan and Jean-Jacques Dessalines the Haitian revolutionary.åÛå         Perhaps because of uneven editing the bookåÛåªs more compelling sections are intercut with repetitious mea culpas and perfunctory inventories of drug and sex binges. (At one point Mr. Tyson claims he was åÛåÏjuggling at least 20åÛå girlfriends.) Passages devoted to particularly notorious aspects of his life åÛåÓ like his tumultuous marriage to the actress Robin Givens his 1992 conviction for the rape of a beauty pageant contestant and his 1997 biting of Evander HolyfieldåÛåªs ear åÛåÓ are among the more predictable parts of the volume: They tend to feel like recitations of stories Mr. Tyson has told many times before.         By far the most absorbing sections of this book deal with Mr. TysonåÛåªs pungent descriptions of individual fights served up in immediate visceral prose; his hard-knock childhood on the mean streets of Brownsville in Brooklyn; and his transformation from an awkward fat boy who was cruelly bullied åÛåÓ a kid named Gary stole one of his beloved pigeons åÛåÏtwisted the birdåÛåªs head off and threw it at me smearing the blood all over my face and shirtåÛå åÛåÓ into a fearsome warrior under the tutelage of his guardian and trainer Cus DåÛåªAmato.         Mr. Tyson talks about being recruited as a thief at the age of 7 by an older boy who had him squeeze through the windows of houses targeted for burglary. He talks about using stolen money to buy pigeons and nice clothes. (åÛåÏI had a ski suit with the yellow goggles and IåÛåªd never been to a ski slope in my life.åÛå) And he talks about DåÛåªAmatoåÛåªs schooling him in the technical aspects of boxing åÛåÓ like the åÛåÏpeek-a-boo styleåÛå defense and aggressive counterpunching åÛåÓ while teaching him how to cultivate a psychological advantage by adopting a savage persona in and out of the ring.         When people suggested he was too short to be an effective heavyweight Mr. Tyson says he åÛåÏbegan to fantasize that if I actually killed someone inside the ring it would certainly intimidate everyone.åÛå

The bulk collection of AmericansåÛåª telephone records åÛåÓ so-called metadata åÛåÓ by the National Security Agency is in our view a clear case of a general warrant that violates the spirit of the framersåÛåª intentions. This intrusive program was authorized under a secret legal process by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court so for years American citizens did not have the knowledge needed to challenge the infringement of their privacy rights.         Our first priority is to keep Americans safe from the threat of terrorism. If government agencies identify a suspected terrorist they should absolutely go to the relevant phone companies to get that personåÛåªs phone records. But this can be done without collecting the records of millions of law-abiding Americans. We recall Benjamin FranklinåÛåªs famous admonition that those who would give up essential liberty in the pursuit of temporary safety will lose both and deserve neither.         The usefulness of the bulk collection program has been greatly exaggerated. We have yet to see any proof that it provides real unique value in protecting national security. In spite of our repeated requests the N.S.A. has not provided evidence of any instance when the agency used this program to review phone records that could not have been obtained using a regular court order or emergency authorization.         Despite this the surveillance reform bill recently ratified by the Senate Intelligence Committee would explicitly permit the government to engage in dragnet collection as long as there were rules about when officials could look at these phone records. It would also give intelligence agencies wide latitude to conduct warrantless searches for AmericansåÛåª phone calls and emails.         This is not the true reform that poll after poll has shown the American people want. It is preserving business as usual. When the Bill of Rights was adopted it established that AmericansåÛåª papers and effects should be seized only when there was specific evidence of suspicious activity. It did not permit government agencies to issue general warrants as long as records seized were reviewed with the permission of senior officials.         Congress has a crucial opportunity to reassert constitutionally guaranteed liberties by reforming the N.S.A.åÛåªs overbroad collection of AmericansåÛåª personal data. But the Intelligence Committee bill squanders this chance. It would enable some of the most constitutionally questionable surveillance activities now exposed to the public eye. The Senate should be reining in these programs not giving them a stamp of approval.         As members of the Intelligence Committee we strongly disagree with this approach. We had already proposed our own bipartisan surveillance reform legislation the Intelligence Oversight and Surveillance Reform Act which we have sponsored with a number of other senators. Our bill would prohibit the government from conducting warrantless åÛåÏbackdoor searchesåÛå of AmericansåÛåª communications åÛåÓ including emails text messages and Internet use åÛåÓ under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It would also create a åÛåÏconstitutional advocateåÛå to present an opposing view when the F.I.S.C. is considering major questions of law or constitutional interpretation.         Rather than adopt our legislation the Intelligence Committee chose to codify excessively broad domestic surveillance authorities. So we offered amendments: One would end the bulk collection of AmericansåÛåª records but still allow intelligence agencies to obtain information they legitimately needed for national security purposes by getting the approval of a judge which could even be done after the fact in emergency situations. Another of our amendments sought to prevent the N.S.A. from collecting AmericansåÛåª cellphone location information in bulk åÛåÓ a capability that potentially turns the cellphone of every man woman and child in America into a tracking device.         Each of these proposals represents real and meaningful reform which we believe would have fulfilled the purpose of protecting our security and liberty. Each was rejected by the committee in some cases by a single vote.         But we will continue to engage with our colleagues and seek to advance the reforms that the American people want and deserve. As part of this effort we will push to hold a comprehensive reform debate on the Senate floor.         There is no question that our nationåÛåªs intelligence professionals are dedicated patriotic men and women who make real sacrifices to help keep our country safe and free. We believe that they should be able to do their jobs secure in the knowledge that their agencies have the confidence of the American people.         But this trust has been undermined by the N.S.A.åÛåªs domestic surveillance programs as well as by senior officialsåÛåª misleading statements about surveillance. Only by ending the dragnet collection of ordinary AmericansåÛåª private information can this trust be rebuilt.         Congress needs to preserve the agenciesåÛåª ability to collect information that is actually necessary to guard against threats to our security. But it also needs to preserve the right of citizens to be free from unwarranted interference in their lives which the framers understood was vital to American liberties.

The North African country will stage the Club World Cup the quirky and in Europe at least rather unloved tournament featuring the club champions of each continent whose participants this year range from part-timers Auckland City to all-conquering Bayern Munich.         The cast also includes ever-grinning Brazilian Ronaldinho who will lead Atletico Mineiro's challenge from South America Italy World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi and Mohamed Aboutrika one of the finest African players of his generation.         Ronaldinho apparently out of the running for a place in Brazil's World Cup squad has recovered from a hamstring injury just in time for what could be his last appearance at an international tournament.         Lippi will lead Asian champions Guangzhou Evergrande the first Chinese side ever to take part and Aboutrika 35 is in the squad of African champions Ah Ahli after he was persuaded to postpone his retirement.         Bayern and Brazil's Atletico Mineiro will parachute in at the semi-final stage next week while the tournament gets under way on Wednesday evening in Agadir when Raja Casablanca who qualified as champions of the host nation face Oceania representatives Auckland.         Rather oddly Raja warmed up by the tournament by sacking Mohamed Fakhir the coach who led them to the Moroccan league title last season and replaced him with Faouzi Benzarti.         The Tunisian who has coached six clubs in his homeland and the national side has had less than a week to prepare his team.         ""This is not my first experience of taking charge of a club during a critical time. For me trust in the group is the most important thing trust"" Benzarti told reporters on Monday.         ""The last three or four days show we have time to do something together. If we co-operate we can make progress very quickly.""         Auckland champions of the Oceania confederation which is dominated by New Zealand are taking part for the fourth time in five years and will be attempting to progress beyond the preliminary round for only the second time.         The quarter-finals which somewhat confusingly feature only four teams will be played in a double-header in Agadir on Saturday.         CONCACAF champions Monterrey back for a third successive appearance and hoping to become the first Mexican team to reach the final will face either Raja Casablanca or Auckland for a place against Atletico Mineiro in Wednesday's semi-final.         EUROPEAN DOMINATION         Saturday's other quarter-final pits Guangzhou against African champions Al Ahli from Egypt with the winners to play Bayern on Tuesday.         ""Winning this competition would crown the treble we won last season"" Bayern forward Thomas Mueller told  FIFA.com .         Al Ahli won the African Champions League in November despite not playing any domestic football after the Egyptian championship was cancelled earlier this year.         Aboutrika had planned to retire after the final against Orlando Pirates but was persuaded to play in Morocco and is included in their squad.         The competition has been played in its current form every year since 2005 after being spawned by the old Intercontinental Cup which was played annually in Tokyo between the champions of Europe and South America.         As much as anything it has become an unhappy illustration of the weakness of club football outside Europe. No European team has ever failed to reach the final since 2005 and they have lifted the trophy on all but two occasions winning five finals in a row before Corinthians beat Chelsea last year.         Africa is staging the tournament for the first time Morocco having won the right to host it two years ago after rivals Iran South Africa and United Arab Emirates withdrew. Two stadiums will be used in the coastal resort of Agadir and in Marrakech.         Morocco which hosted the African Nations Cup in 1988 bid to stage the 1994 1998 2006 and 2010 World Cups. They came close twice losing out by 10 votes to seven to the United States in the race for the 1994 tournament and were beaten by 14 votes to 10 by South Africa for 2010.

""I'm very inspired by it"" director Gabriela Cowperthwaite told Reuters.         ""Blackfish"" which aired nationally on CNN in October makes a case against keeping orcas in captivity for entertainment. SeaWorld has called the film ""inaccurate and misleading.""         Rocker Joan Jett on Monday became the fourth musician or musical group to show support for a campaign led by animal-rights activists by asking SeaWorld to stop using her 1981 hit ""I Love Rock 'n Roll"" as opening music for the theme park's ""Shamu Rocks"" an evening version of the killer whale show.         Jett's demand followed decisions by country singer Willie Nelson and rock bands Barenaked Ladies and Heart to withdraw from the theme park's Bands Brew & BBQ event on weekends starting February 1.         Jett threatened to join a protest by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) outside the park unless she received written confirmation that her music would no longer be used according to her letter to SeaWorld CEO Jim Atchison posted on PETA's website.         ""I'm among the millions who saw 'Blackfish' and am sickened that my music was blasted without my permission at sound-sensitive marine mammals"" Jett wrote. ""These intelligent and feeling creatures communicate by sonar and are driven crazy in the tiny tanks in which they are confined.""         SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck said Jett's song was fully licensed and previously played - but no longer in use - as walk-on music for the Shamu show.         As to the cancellations by other musical acts Gollattscheck issued a written statement saying: ""While we're disappointed a small group of misinformed individuals was able to deny fans what would have been great concerts at SeaWorld by Heart Barenaked Ladies and Willie Nelson we respect the bands' decisions.""         ""Blackfish"" details the life of Tilikum a 12000-pound bull orca who grabbed 40-year-old trainer Dawn Brancheau by her ponytail in 2010 and drowned her in front of park guests.         After her death a federal judge sided with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) which claimed SeaWorld exposed its trainers to a hazardous environment and ordered the theme park to physically separate trainers and orcas in performances.         SeaWorld appealed in November arguing that OSHA rules ""cannot be used to force a company to change the very product that it offers the public and the business it is in."" A ruling is pending.         Meanwhile Cowperthwaite said ""Blackfish"" is having a resurgence since being short-listed for an Academy Award.

Nelson Mandela left this world having enormously altered it.         And yet the extraordinary example that he set lives on and provides a lesson åÛåÓ a blueprint åÛåÓ for all of us who still labor for justice equality and freedom.         Be convinced of your cause. Conviction character and consistency are sorely lacking in our modern era of fame-chasing poll-testing and comment-reading. The status quo has a way of lulling the masses into complacency and acceptance. ItåÛåªs known and familiar. There are always those whose lives are comfortable and whose livelihoods are secure under it.         Upsetting the status quo åÛåÓ or upending it åÛåÓ is always a radical proposition and is often an unpopular one sometimes even among those who suffer under the entrenched system. Your cause may be unpopular but history has demonstrated again and again that it will look kindly on the just.         First be a fighter. Time has a way of rendering history smooth and digestible of polishing away the rough bits and sweetening the bitter. Mandela was not only a lovely grandfatherly figure; he was also a freedom fighter a man willing to commit his life to åÛåÓ or even sacrifice it for åÛåÓ what he believed in.         MandelaåÛåªs African National Congress was once deemed a terrorist organization by both his home country South Africa and by the United States. And AmericaåÛåªs view of Mandela and of South AfricaåÛåªs system of apartheid cannot be whitewashed even as we now venerate Mandela in death.         As Noam Chomsky wrote in his 2010 book åÛåÏHopes and ProspectsåÛå:         åÛåÏThrough the 1980s U.S. trade with South Africa increased despite the 1985 congressional sanctions (which Reagan evaded) and Reagan continued to back South African depredations in neighboring countries that led to an estimated 1.5 million deaths. As late as 1988 the administration condemned Nelson MandelaåÛåªs African National Congress as one of the worldåÛåªs åÛå÷more notorious terrorist groups.åÛåªåÛå         Be brave. Courage is not required to execute that which is easy or convenient. As the Texas progressive author and agitator Jim Hightower once put it åÛåÏEven a dead fish can go with the flow.åÛå Courage is drawing up your shoulder and pushing into the resistance. Courage is doing what is unpopular or dangerous or discomforting because even if you must do it alone it is the right thing to do.         As Mandela put it: åÛåÏI learned that courage was not the absence of fear but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid but he who conquers that fear.åÛå We all feel fear. In fact fear the person who claims that he or she does not. But fear withers under the heat of righteousness. It cannot spread when it is cornered by those of noble conviction.         Remember that no one can divest you of your basic humanity without your submission and allowance. Discrimination and injustice are insidious virulent scourges that the world is working hard to remedy but they remain stubbornly resistant to complete eradication. Even as we labor to be rid of them let us all retain our resolve and rise up in our dignity.         I like to think of it the way Zora Neale Hurston once put it: åÛåÏSometimes I feel discriminated against but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company? ItåÛåªs beyond me.åÛå The person consumed by discrimination morally subjugates himself or herself as a matter of principle to the person free of it leaving the person free of it with the moral high ground.         Never underestimate the power of grace. MandelaåÛåªs immeasurable grace and equanimity his presidency and his efforts at reconciliation in South Africa will forever serve as an example to the world of the true possibilities and power of the human spirit. We so often think of power as force but there is also enormous power in love understanding and forgiveness. Demonstrating kindness to those who have treated you cruelly is an act of moral supremacy. It is the most powerful of human exercises because in so doing you conquer the self and diminish your enemy.         Finally remember that all things are possible for those of strong will and unwavering perseverance. Those who canåÛåªt imagine change reveal the deficits of their imaginations not the difficulty of change. As Mandela put it åÛåÏIt always seems impossible until itåÛåªs done.åÛå

But in a major embarrassment to the health groups the calculator appears to greatly overestimate risk so much so that it could mistakenly suggest that millions more people are candidates for statin drugs.         The apparent problem prompted one leading cardiologist a past president of the American College of Cardiology to call on Sunday for a halt to the implementation of the new guidelines.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs stunningåÛå said the cardiologist Dr. Steven Nissen chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. åÛåÏWe need a pause to further evaluate this approach before it is implemented on a widespread basis.åÛå         The controversy set off turmoil at the annual meeting of the  American Heart Association  which started this weekend in Dallas. After an emergency session on Saturday night the two organizations that published the guidelines åÛåÓ the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology åÛåÓ said that while the calculator was not perfect it was a major step forward and that the guidelines already say patients and doctors should discuss treatment options rather than blindly follow a calculator.         Dr. Sidney Smith the executive chairman of the guideline committee said the associations would examine the flaws found in the calculator and determine if changes were needed. åÛåÏWe need to see if the concerns raised are substantiveåÛå he said in a telephone interview on Sunday. åÛåÏDo there need to be changes?åÛå         The problems were identified by two Harvard Medical School professors whose findings will be published Tuesday in a commentary in The Lancet a major medical journal. The professors Dr. Paul M. Ridker and Dr. Nancy Cook had pointed out the problems a year earlier when the National Institutes of HealthåÛåªs National Heart Lung and Blood Institute which originally was developing the guidelines sent a draft to each professor independently to review. Both reported back that the calculator was not working among the populations it was tested on by the guideline makers.         That was unfortunate because the committee thought the researchers had been given the professorsåÛåª responses said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones co-chairman of the guidelines task force and chairman of the department of  preventive medicine  at Northwestern University.         Drs. Ridker and Cook saw the final guidelines and risk calculator on Tuesday at 4 p.m. when a news embargo was lifted and saw that the problems remained.         On Saturday night members of the association and the college of cardiology held a hastily called closed-door meeting with Dr. Ridker who directs the Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Brigham and WomenåÛåªs Hospital in Boston. He showed them his data and pointed out the problem. On Sunday officials from the organizations struggled with how to respond.         Other experts said there has not been a real appreciation of the difficulties with this and other risk calculators. åÛåÏI donåÛåªt think people have a good idea of what needs to be doneåÛå said Dr. Michael Blaha director of clinical research at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University who was not associated with forming the new guidelines.         Dr. Blaha said the problem might have stemmed from the fact that the calculator uses as reference points data collected more than a decade ago when more people smoked and had strokes and heart attacks earlier in life. For example the guideline makers used data from studies in the 1990s to determine how various risk factors like cholesterol levels and  blood pressure  led to actual heart attacks and strokes over a decade of observation.         But people have changed in the past few decades Dr. Blaha said. Among other things there is no longer such a big gap between womenåÛåªs risks and those of men at a given age. And people get heart attacks and strokes at older ages.         åÛåÏThe cohorts were from a different eraåÛå Dr. Blaha said.         This week after they saw the guidelines and the calculator Dr. Ridker and Dr. Cook evaluated it using three large studies that involved thousands of people and continued for at least a decade. They knew the subjectsåÛåª characteristics at the start åÛåÓ their ages whether they smoked their cholesterol levels their blood pressures. Then they asked how many had heart attacks or strokes in the next 10 years and how many would the risk calculator predict.         The answer was that the calculator overpredicted risk by 75 to 150 percent depending on the population. A man whose risk was 4 percent for example might show up as having an 8 percent risk. With a 4 percent risk he would not warrant treatment åÛåÓ the guidelines that say treatment is advised for those with at least a 7.5 percent risk and that treatment can be considered for those whose risk is 5 percent.

The hard-fought passage here Tuesday of a  landmark bill trimming retirement benefits  for state workers aimed at fixing the vastly underfunded pension system has become instantly relevant to the nationåÛåªs third-largest city which has its own pension systems in various stages of financial collapse.         And if anything the reckoning in Chicago is even nearer and more difficult than the one the state had faced putting its Democratic mayor  Rahm Emanuel  in a difficult position under a tight deadline.         Under state law the city must increase its contributions to its workersåÛåª pension funds by $590 million in 2015 to a total annual contribution of $1.4 billion for current and future retirees. If no pension deal can be reached by November of next year when the city will draft its next budget the city will either have to raise taxes or cut services or some combination of both.         But city officials are hoping there is now momentum on their side to force a compromise solution. They come armed not only with TuesdayåÛåªs state vote but also with  a federal judgeåÛåªs ruling  also on Tuesday to formally send Detroit into bankruptcy. Chicago is not facing bankruptcy but the Detroit case produced a development being watched closely by cities and unions across the country: It explicitly permitted changes to public pension funds to help the city shed its debts and reorganize.         åÛåÏShould Chicago fail to get pension relief soon we will be faced with a 2015 budget that will either double city property taxes or eliminate the vital services that people rely onåÛå Mr. Emanuel said in an email on Wednesday. åÛåÏTo avoid that we need a balanced approach. We need a plan that is fair to both workers and taxpayers and gives them both the certainty and security they are looking for.åÛå         Pension changes must be part of the calculus he said.         åÛåÏWithout reform and revenue we cannot make the critical investments in our future åÛåÓ and the future of our children and neighborhoodsåÛå the mayor wrote. åÛåÏWithout reform and revenue we cannot be the city that we want to be.åÛå         One  credit rating agency  Fitch Ratings estimated that if there is no deal to reduce pension benefits for city workers and no cuts in services the city will have to increase property taxes by 35 percent.         Actually the situation is even worse said Laurence Msall president of the  Civic Federation  a government watchdog group. The Fitch study looked only at police and firefighter pensions. If you include pensions for teachers laborers and other municipal employees property taxes in that situation would have to more than double he said.         Angry union officials say they will file suit in state court in coming days to have the new state law overturned a process that could last more than a year and they argue that no further deals involving the more than 62000 Chicago workers should be enacted until that litigation plays out. City officials say they cannot wait that long.         åÛåÏThereåÛåªs a definite hole in the budget and neither taxpayers or employees should be expected to fill it aloneåÛå said Kelley Quinn a spokeswoman for the mayor. åÛåÏThe longer we delay the worse the problem gets.åÛå         Union leaders are not in such a rush.         åÛåÏThere certainly seems to be a will to address ChicagoåÛåªs pensions and obviously the mayor is pushing that vigorouslyåÛå said Daniel J. Montgomery president of the Illinois Federation of Teachers. åÛåÏBut if they are looking to duplicate what they did to the state systems theyåÛåªve got a few legal hurdles.åÛå         For one thing he said the Illinois Constitution has åÛåÏvery clear and precise languageåÛå that guarantees that retirement benefits cannot be lowered. The ruling on Tuesday by the judge overseeing DetroitåÛåªs bankruptcy that federal law trumps the Michigan Constitution when it comes to lowering benefits does not apply in Illinois Mr. Montgomery said.         åÛåÏThe City of Chicago is not bankruptåÛå he said. åÛåÏIt is an entirely different situation.åÛå         Michael K. Shields president of ChicagoåÛåªs Fraternal Order of Police said there was no way to compare the new state bill with the situation faced by his members. åÛåÏThis pension bill is not one size fits allåÛå he said.         He pointed out that much of the benefit cuts in the state law came from changes in the way annual cost-of-living raises are dispensed. While state workers received annual raises of 3 percent that compounded every year Chicago police officers and firefighters receive a flat raise of at most 3 percent that does not compound. So more benefit cuts would have to be found elsewhere for those city workers.         Other union leaders were even more blunt.

Cold weather brings the promise of several months without awkward sightings of the neighbors whom her family refers to as the Nakeds.         Ms. Sessoms who lives with her husband and two young children in Harlem first spotted one of the Nakeds two summers ago while enjoying a glass of wine on her apartment balcony one evening. The balcony overlooks the backyards of several brownstones and out of the one directly opposite her emerged a 40ish woman with dreadlocks wearing nothing but a T-shirt.         åÛåÏI thought well maybe sheåÛåªs running outside to let the cat or dog inåÛå Ms. Sessoms 43 said. åÛåÏBut then she started gardening nude.åÛå         As in shirt gone completely naked?         åÛåÏCompletely nakedåÛå Ms. Sessoms said.         She yelled for her husband to come look. åÛåÏHeåÛåªs like åÛå÷I donåÛåªt want to see my neighbor nakedåÛåªÌâåÊåÛå she said. åÛåÏIåÛåªm like åÛå÷No no you have to see.åÛåª But by the time he came she was gone and he didnåÛåªt believe me.åÛå         Credibility was restored as the sightings increased in frequency and began to involve other family members: the husband taking naked smoking breaks; the couple and their two young children dining alfresco and au natural.         åÛåÏThe husband was grilling nakedåÛå Ms. Sessoms said. åÛåÏThatåÛåªs a little dangerous.åÛå         Ms. Sessoms was recalling these events on an unseasonably warm fall afternoon a few weeks ago on the same balcony that overlooks her neighborsåÛåª yard. It was the kind of day a reporter pointed out that a nudist might regard as an invitation for a late-season frolic.         åÛåÏWe were really excited about this balconyåÛå Ms. Sessoms said looking across at her neighborsåÛåª yard warily. åÛåÏWe donåÛåªt enjoy it as much as we thought we would.åÛå         In a city like New York where residents live in such close proximity nudity is an often unavoidable part of domestic life. The living room window of one apartment faces the bedroom of another which has an unobstructed view into the bathroom of a third. Many of the cityåÛåªs interiors åÛåÓ especially those of some of the newer glass-sheathed buildings åÛåÓ afford all the privacy of a gym locker room. (Indeed in some corridors of the city  along the High Line  especially near  the Standard hotel  the nudity on display seems to be part of the attraction.)         And while some people are titillated or disturbed by seeing a neighbor naked others are driven to distraction as one man who  posted a letter on Craigslist  several years ago claimed to be. Under the heading åÛåÏPlease stop walking around naked åÛåÓ 25th StreetåÛå he confessed to seeing his young blond female neighbor on several occasions and said that it was killing his work productivity. In his open letter he pleaded åÛåÏWhen you practice booty dancing in your underwear in front of the mirror then IåÛåªm screwed.åÛå         The Craigslist poster complained that his neighbor not only danced half-naked but did so with the lights on and the blinds up a habit shared by other New Yorkers. Living among 8.3 million people tends to create a sense of anonymity and encourage a laid-back attitude toward baring it all at home. If the guy in the next building sees a flash of skin as you go from the shower to the closet åÛåÓ or practice booty dancing åÛåÓ so what?         In New York said  Helen Schulman a novelist  and professor of writing at a university in Manhattan åÛåÏyou donåÛåªt really know the people across the way. I donåÛåªt think itåÛåªs the same in a small town.åÛå         From her office Ms. Schulman 52 enjoys a åÛåÏRear WindowåÛå-like view into a mix of prewar apartment buildings and townhouses. Over the years she said she has noticed one resident in particular: åÛåÏMy window looks straight into his bedroom and he never closes his curtains or shades. HeåÛåªs reliably naked.åÛå (She asked that her employer go unnamed so as not to embarrass the man.)         Half of literary New York has seen this immodest fellow Ms. Schulman joked explaining that when visiting writers come to her office she points him out. åÛåÏItåÛåªs a really funny icebreakeråÛå she said.         If you havenåÛåªt seen someone in the buff or nearly naked itåÛåªs likely that someone has seen you. Most residents of big apartment buildings are skilled at the half-naked dash to the hall closet and back or the shirtless plunge into the hallway for the Sunday paper.         åÛåÏWe all stumble out in the morningåÛå Ms. Schulman said of the residents of her Upper West Side building. åÛåÏIf our neighbor comes out in boxers or a T-shirt I say åÛå÷Oh weåÛåªve all seen it already.åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå

As head of its contemporary art department he has pursued and persuaded collectors to let him sell their masterpieces. He auctioned Edvard MunchåÛåªs pastel åÛåÏThe ScreamåÛå for nearly $120 million last year. And last week he sold Andy WarholåÛåªs åÛåÏSilver Car Crash (Double Disaster)åÛå for $104.5 million.         But on Friday the company announced that Mr. Meyer was leaving by mutual decision. He said he wants a career change that will put him on the opposite side of the auction podium he has dominated for 20 years. He said he intended to continue working with collectors only this time as a private dealer.         SothebyåÛåªs tried to play down the loss calling to assuage important clients and minimize the impact according to dealers in the field. But the news jolted the art world where Mr. Meyer had the ear of many powerful buyers including the publishing magnate S. I. Newhouse Jr. the fashion designer Tom Ford the Taipei businessman Pierre Chen and the entertainment mogul David Geffen.         While his departure follows SothebyåÛåªs biggest sale ever totaling $380 million on Nov. 14 the firm finished a distant second to its archrival ChristieåÛåªs whose own sale the previous night brought in $691.5 million.         The news also comes at a particularly vulnerable moment for the auction house. SothebyåÛåªs has been under attack by the activist investor and hedge fund manager Daniel S. Loeb who said last month that he wanted to join the companyåÛåªs board and called for William F. Ruprecht its chief executive to step down describing the company as having a åÛåÏcrisis of leadership.åÛå Mr. Loeb who owns 9.3 percent of the company and is its largest shareholder added åÛåÏSothebyåÛåªs is like an old master painting in desperate need of restoration.åÛå         It also comes as SothebyåÛåªs has been losing business to ChristieåÛåªs after traditionally running neck and neck. ChristieåÛåªs edge began increasing several years ago when to win market share the firm started giving sellers especially lucrative financial incentives. (SothebyåÛåªs to be competitive followed.)         The companyåÛåªs critics say it is falling behind ChristieåÛåªs in Asia especially in China an increasingly important market where ChristieåÛåªs this year won permission to independently hold sales. And they want SothebyåÛåªs to use its assets more efficiently including selling its New York headquarters åÛåÓ a step SothebyåÛåªs is considering.         The two competitors are markedly different. While SothebyåÛåªs is a publicly traded company on the New York stock exchange with shareholders to answer to ChristieåÛåªs is privately held and its owner FranÌÄå¤ois Pinault the luxury goods magnate based in Paris is a passionate collector himself with deep pockets.         At SothebyåÛåªs Mr. Ruprecht declined to comment about Mr. MeyeråÛåªs exit but in a statement he said: åÛåÏWith TobiasåÛåªs contract soon expiring we all agreed it was time to part ways. We wish Tobias nothing but good fortune.åÛå         Not wanting to make it seem as though one of the companyåÛåªs biggest profit centers was left rudderless Mr. Ruprecht praised the contemporary art team of more than 60 employees led by Alexander Rotter in New York and Cheyenne Westphal in Europe. (SothebyåÛåªs may not be the only auction house to lose a big business-getter. Several art dealers said they had heard that Amy Cappellazzo ChristieåÛåªs chairwoman of post-war and contemporary art development is leaving the company; a ChristieåÛåªs official denied that.)         Dealers said on Friday that their phones had been ringing nonstop with the news. åÛåÏPeople are surprisedåÛå said Larry Gagosian the super-dealer. åÛåÏTobias has been a larger-than-life presence in the auction world. He wore two big hats and that will be a challenge to fill.åÛå

In the 20th century support for redistributive policies emerged as a dominant force in national politics only in the Depression decade of the 1930s; it was intermittently influential from 1945 to 1965.         More recently a  2008 study  of public attitudes during periods of mounting inequality found that åÛåÏwhen inequality in America rises the public responds with increased conservative sentiment.åÛå This conservative shift applies to all income groups including the poor according to the political scientists Nathan Kelly of the University of Tennessee and Peter Enns of Cornell. åÛåÏRather than generating opinion shifts that would make redistributive policies more likelyåÛå Kelly and Enns write åÛåÏincreased economic inequality produces a conservative response in public sentiment.åÛå         The Kelly-Enns study examines poll data and inequality trends between 1952 and 2006. In an email Enns wrote earlier this week he added that more recent data shows a continuation of the trend: åÛåÏbetween 2006 and 2011 (when the most recent data are available) inequality has mostly continued to increase and the public has shifted in a more conservative direction åÛåÓ especially since 2008. This relationship is consistent with our previous findings.åÛå         A key tool Kelly and Enns use for their work is a statistical analysis of the policy mood of the country developed by  James Stimson  of the University of North Carolina. Stimson using data from all available commercial and academic surveys including American National Election Studies and Gallup illustrated his findings in a graph  Figure 1  which covers the years 1952 to 2012. The graph tracks swings in public opinion both to the left and right using responses to polling questions measuring levels of support for government programs.         From 1992 to 2012 according to StimsonåÛåªs analysis overall support for liberal pro-government initiatives has declined. These results suggest that President ObamaåÛåªs plan to dedicate the remainder of his term to reducing inequality to which he devoted  a major speech  last week will face significant political opposition inside and outside of Congress.         Obama argues that government action is required to redress the  growing disparity  between rich and poor  diminished opportunities  for upward mobility and  economic stagnation . Public opinion at least according to the Stimson analysis is moving in precisely the opposite direction.  A 2011 Pew Research Center survey  gives us a glimpse of some of the headwinds Obama faces. Pew found that among all voters capitalism (a rough proxy for deregulated markets) is viewed favorably by a 50-40 margin and socialism (a rough proxy for interventionist government) negatively by 60-31.         An exception according to Pew åÛåÒ illustrated in  Figure 2  åÛåÓ lies in the views of black and Hispanic voters. Both groups hold more negative than positive views of capitalism: blacks 51-41 and Hispanics 55-32. Blacks hold a positive view of socialism 55-36; Hispanics by a modest 5 points a negative view 49-44. This Pew data suggests that pro-government activists of the kind Obama needs to back his inequality agenda remain a minority.         One of the crucial questions in determining likely support for or opposition to government initiatives to remediate inequality is whether a voter believes that people are poor because of their own bad choices or thinks that poverty is the result of what pollsters call åÛåÏcircumstancesåÛå: dangerous neighborhoods inadequate housing bad schools discrimination.         A  Pew survey  conducted in 2012 produced results that demonstrated the nationåÛåªs ambivalence on this question. The more voters blame poverty on a lack of effort by the poor themselves the more inclined they are to say that there are legions of åÛåÏundeservingåÛå poor for whom taxpayer-funded government programs are not warranted. The more a respondent blames poverty on external circumstances the more likely he or she is to support government action to remedy those circumstances.         Overall according to Pew 46 percent of the public does not fault the poor agreeing that their plight is the outcome of unfavorable circumstances while 38 percent are more judgmental declaring that poverty stems from a lack of individual effort.         This relatively modest 8-point difference among all voters masks very large partisan åÛåÓ and significant racial and ethnic åÛåÓ divisions. A decisive majority of Republicans (see Figure 3) 57-27 say that people are poor because of a lack of effort while an even larger majority of Democrats 61-24 say åÛåÏcircumstancesåÛå are the cause of poverty. Whites are split 41-41 while blacks back circumstances 62-28 as do Hispanics 59-27.         In his  Dec. 4 speech  at the pro-Democratic Center for American Progress Obama acknowledged the racial and ideological hurdles he faces. He told his audience:

The friend was a political liberal and lifelong Democrat accustomed to being on the wrong side of his churchåÛåªs teaching on issues like abortion bioethics and same-sex marriage.         Now he cheerfully suggested right-leaning Catholics like me would get a taste of the same experience from a pope who seemed intent on skirting the culture war and stressing the churchåÛåªs mission to the poor instead.         After FrancisåÛåªs latest headline-making  exhortation  which roves across the entire life of the church but includes a sharp critique of consumer capitalism and financial laissez-faire politically conservative Catholics have reached for several explanations for why my friend is wrong and why they arenåÛåªt the new åÛåÏcafeteria Catholics.åÛå         First they have pointed out that thereåÛåªs nothing truly novel here apart from a lazy media narrative that pits Good Pope Francis against his bad reactionary predecessors. (Many of the new popeåÛåªs comments track with what Benedict XVI said in his  own economic encyclical  and with past papal criticisms of commercial capitalismåÛåªs discontents.)         Second they have sought to  depoliticize the popeåÛåªs comments  recasting them as a general brief against avarice and consumerism rather than a call for specific government interventions.         And finally they have insisted on the difference between church teaching on faith and morals and papal pronouncements on economic issues noting that thereåÛåªs nothing that obliges Catholics to believe the pontiff is  infallible on questions of public policy .         All three responses have their merits but they still seem insufficient to the Francis eraåÛåªs challenge to Catholics on the limited-government free-market right.         ItåÛåªs true that there is far more continuity between Francis and Benedict than media accounts suggest. But the new pope clearly intends to foreground the churchåÛåªs social teaching in new ways and probably seeks roughly the press coverage heåÛåªs getting.         ItåÛåªs also true that FrancisåÛåªs framework is pastoral rather than political. But his plain language tilts leftward in ways that no serious reader can deny.         Finally itåÛåªs true that there is no Catholic position on say the correct marginal tax rate and that Catholics are not obliged to heed the pope when he suggests that global inequality is increasing when the  statistical evidence  suggests otherwise.         But the churchåÛåªs social teaching is no less an official teaching for allowing room for disagreement on its policy implications. And for Catholics who pride themselves on fidelity to Rome the burden is on them åÛåÓ on us åÛåÓ to explain why a worldview that inspires left-leaning papal rhetoric also allows for right-of-center conclusions.         That explanation rests I think on three ideas. First that when it comes to lifting the poor out of poverty global capitalism faults and all has a  better track record  by far than any other system or approach.         Second that Catholic social teaching properly understood emphasizes both solidarity  and  subsidiarity åÛåÓ that is a small-c conservative preference for local efforts over national ones voluntarism over bureaucracy.         Third that on recent evidence the most expansive welfare states can  crowd out  what Christianity considers the most basic human goods åÛåÓ by  lowering birthrates   discouraging private charity  and restricting the churchåÛåªs  freedom to minister  in subtle but increasingly consequential ways.         This Catholic case for limited government however is not a case for the Ayn Randian temptation inherent to a capitalism-friendly politics. There is no Catholic warrant for valorizing entrepreneurs at the expense of ordinary workers or for dismissing all regulation as unnecessary and all redistribution as immoral.         And this is where FrancisåÛåªs vision should matter to American Catholics who usually cast ballots for Republican politicians. The popeåÛåªs words shouldnåÛåªt inspire them to convert en masse to liberalism or to worry that the throne of Peter has been seized by a Marxist anti-pope. But they should encourage a much greater integration of Catholic and conservative ideas than weåÛåªve seen since  åÛåÏcompassionate conservatismåÛå collapsed  and inspire Catholics to ask more åÛåÓ often much more åÛåÓ of the Republican Party on a  range of policy issues .         Here my journalist friendåÛåªs åÛåÏloyal oppositionåÛå line oversimplified the options for Catholic political engagement. His Catholic liberalism didnåÛåªt go into eclipse because it failed to let the Vatican dictate every jot and tittle of its social agenda. Rather it lost influence because it failed to articulate  any  kind of clear Catholic difference within the bigger liberal tent on issues like abortion sex and marriage.         Now the challenge for conservative Catholics is to do somewhat better in our turn and to spend the Francis era not in opposition but seeking integration åÛåÓ meaning an economic vision that remains conservative but in the details reminds the world that our Catholic faith comes first.

But in the stepped-up competition for readers digital news sites are increasingly blurring the line between fact and fiction and saying that it is all part of doing business in the rough-and-tumble world of online journalism.         Several recent stories rocketing around the web picking up millions of views turned out to be fake or embellished: a Twitter tale of a Thanksgiving feud on a plane later described by the writer as a short story; a childåÛåªs letter to Santa that detailed an Amazon.com link in crayon but was actually written by a grown-up comedian in 2011; and an essay on poverty that prompted $60000 in donations until it was revealed by its author to be impressionistic rather than strictly factual.         Their creators describe them essentially as online performance art never intended to be taken as fact. But to the media outlets that published them they represented the lightning-in-a-bottle brew of emotion and entertainment that attracts readers and brings in lucrative advertising dollars.         When the tales turned out to be phony the modest hand-wringing that ensued was accompanied by an admission that viral trumps verified åÛåÓ and that little will be done about it as long as the clicks keep coming. åÛåÏYou are seeing news organizations say åÛå÷If it is happening on the Internet thatåÛåªs our beatåÛåªÌâåÊåÛå said Joshua Benton director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard. åÛåÏThe next step of figuring out whether it happened in real life is up to someone else.åÛå         The difference seems to be that the news organizations that published the recent pieces åÛåÓ Gawker BuzzFeed The Huffington Post and Mashable among them åÛåÓ do not see invented viral tales as being completely at odds with the serious new content they publish alongside them. The Huffington Post won a Pulitzer Prize in 2012 Gawker was among the first to report the cocaine use by TorontoåÛåªs mayor Rob Ford and BuzzFeed is building teams of investigative and foreign correspondents. Of course websites like these are not the only news organizations to be seduced by stories that are too good to be true. In just the last month CBSåÛåªs venerable åÛåÏ60 MinutesåÛå had to apologize for taking too credulously the claims of a security agent about the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi Libya.         Instead editors at these sites acknowledge frankly that there are trade-offs in balancing authenticity with the need to act quickly in a hyperconnected age. åÛåÏWe are dealing with a volume of information that it is impossible to have the strict standards of accuracy that other institutions haveåÛå said John Cook editor in chief of Gawker which highlighted the essay on poverty by a woman named Linda Tirado.         åÛåÏThe faster metabolism puts people who fact-check at a disadvantageåÛå said Ryan Grim the Washington bureau chief for The Huffington Post which reposted the fictional airplane tweets the letter to Santa and the poverty essay. åÛåÏIf you throw something up without fact-checking it and youåÛåªre the first one to put it up and you get millions and millions of views and later itåÛåªs proved false you still got those views. ThatåÛåªs a problem. The incentives are all wrong.åÛå         But Mr. Cook says he thinks that readers can tell which content is serious and which is taken from the web without vetting. åÛåÏWe assume a certain level of sophistication and skepticism of our readersåÛå he said.         Elan Gale 30 a television producer and the author of the invented article on the feud on the plane is not convinced. His fictitious Twitter tale of exchanging increasingly hostile notes with a fellow passenger spread rapidly åÛåÓ a compilation of his posts got 5.6 million views. BuzzFeed sensed the tremor in the web and posted it attracting nearly 1.5 million views to its site. (The New York Times travel section blog also linked to their story but labeled it as imaginary when it was discovered to be untrue.) Finally Mr. Gale revealed that the entire exchange was fake and BuzzFeed posted an update describing the story as a lie and a hoax.

The cardiologists said that the company Anthera Pharmaceuticals did not turn over data to academic investigators as it was required to do for more than a year.         åÛåÏDespite a contract that required transfer to the academic authors the company stonewalled every attempt to acquire the dataåÛå Dr. Steven Nissen a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic said in an email on Tuesday.         Dr. Nissen was the senior author of a report on the data that was published online Monday by The Journal of the American Medical Association and presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association in Dallas. In unveiling the results there the lead investigator Dr. Stephen Nicholls publicly admonished the company.         Dr. Colin Hislop the chief medical officer at Anthera denied the accusations saying it simply took time to gather and organize the data. åÛåÏI donåÛåªt think the timeline was particularly protracted nor were we being difficultåÛå he said in an interview Tuesday.         Studies and lawsuits have shown that many clinical trial results particularly negative ones are not published. Critics say that hampers medical practice and violates an obligation to patients who try experimental treatments in part to advance knowledge.         åÛåÏWe think that when you enter into a clinical trial and we enter into contracts with our patients thereåÛåªs an obligation that we are going to do the right thingåÛå said Dr. Nicholls a cardiologist at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute in Adelaide.         The Phase 3 trial involved 5145 patients in various countries with  acute coronary syndrome  a sudden blockage of blood flow to heart muscles. It tested whether the drug varespladib could reduce the risk of heart attacks stroke death and chest pains requiring hospitalization.         The trial was terminated early by the safety monitoring committee in March 2012. The company announced that the committee had determined that there was no chance the drug would succeed in the trial.         The results show that patients who got the drug actually had a higher risk of cardiovascular problems mainly heart attacks than those who received a placebo.         Dr. Nicholls said in an interview that Anthera continually promised to provide the complete data but did not. Finally the company told him this spring that it had given the drug back to Eli Lilly the original developer of the drug. The investigators were then able to get the data almost immediately from Lilly he said.         Dr. Nicholls said that Anthera was also supposed to ensure that all patients were surveyed six months after the trial ended to see if they were still alive. But that data was collected for only 31 percent of the patients making it impossible to clearly determine if the drug had increased the risk of death he said.         Dr. Hislop of Anthera said the organization hired by the company to oversee the trial had tried vigorously to get that data. But some investigators who were the ones who knew the patientsåÛåª identities did not cooperate.         He said that because of the need to collect the six-month follow-up data the study database was kept open until early this year. That was just before the company gave back the drug to Lilly.         Anthera based in Hayward Calif. was founded in 2004 and does not yet have a drug on the market. It is testing a treatment for lupus.

The intensifying  frustrations of delivering aid  after Typhoon Haiyan struck last week elicited a plea from the top United Nations relief official to the mayor of Tacloban imploring him to persuade gas station owners to open so relief convoys could begin a large-scale expansion into the flattened port city of 220000 and interior regions of Leyte Province. The gas stations have fuel in their tanks but the owners fear theft and violence if they reopen.         åÛåÏWe have to have fuel so we have to have some kind of refueling centeråÛå Valerie Amos the United Nations official told the mayor Alfred S. Romualdez at a public meeting after she flew here for an assessment.         Mr. Romualdez told Ms. Amos that the city could not easily cope with the influx of aid workers as practically no vehicles were available to bring them in from the airport while food and drinking water were running out. åÛåÏIåÛåªm asking those who come here åÛå÷Please be self-sufficient because thereåÛåªs nothingåÛåªÌâåÊåÛå he said.         The mayoråÛåªs best advice to residents was to leave and find shelter with relatives if they could saying that the local authorities were struggling to provide food and water and faced difficulties in maintaining law and order.         The paralysis was epitomized by the first attempt in Tacloban to conduct a mass burial of typhoon victims whose corpses had been putrefying for days on the streets and under piles of debris. The attempt ended in failure as trucks carrying more than 200 corpses were forced to turn back when they faced gunfire at the city limits. The identities of the gunmen were not clear.         Covered with black plastic tarpaulin the bodies were returned to a makeshift outdoor morgue at the foot of the hill topped by City Hall where they emitted a powerful odor in the tropical heat.         TaclobanåÛåªs paralysis was acknowledged later in the day by the United States government which is playing a major role in the emergency effort using military cargo planes to bring in aid and to evacuate the most vulnerable residents. In a telephone briefing from Washington a senior official assigned to the effort said that it was focused mainly on food water shelter and medicine but that the provision of fuel in the city was åÛåÏvery much on our radar screen åÛåÓ that is a whole part of the logistical morass weåÛåªre working our way through.åÛå         Another senior American official in the briefing said that the number of American uniformed personnel on the ground in the Philippines currently at about 300 would rise to 1000 in the next few days with most coming from a Marine base in Okinawa Japan. The official said the United States was helping transport Filipino soldiers assigned to the disaster zone which cuts through the middle of the country.         The American officials also said a land route into Tacloban had been reopened which would ease the bottleneck at the airport. åÛåÏIt was like squeezing orange juice through a strawåÛå one said. åÛåÏNow we have more straws.åÛå         International relief groups said they were rapidly escalating their response in Tacloban and elsewhere. Doctors Without Borders the Paris-based medical agency said its teams had traveled by car boat plane and helicopter to some of the outlying areas of northern Cebu Island eastern Samar Island Panay Island and western Leyte Province which neither the Philippine government nor other agencies had been able to reach. The teams found desperation the group said in a  statement . The village of Guiuan in Samar was flattened and half of Roxas City on Panay was destroyed.         åÛåÏAccess is extremely difficult and is preventing people from receiving helpåÛå said Dr. Natasha Reyes the groupåÛåªs emergency coordinator in the Philippines.         Despite the problems in Tacloban the World Food Program  said Wednesday  that it had managed to provide family-size packets of rice and canned goods to nearly 50000 residents and that 500 tons of rice was en route.         Mayor Romualdez said the city desperately needed trucks and drivers to distribute shipments of food piling up at the airport as well as more trucks heavy equipment and personnel to retrieve decaying corpses from the wreckage across the city.         åÛåÏI have to decide at every meeting which is more important relief goods or picking up cadaversåÛå he said.

The judge Steven W. Rhodes dealt a major blow to the widely held belief that state laws preserve public pensions and his ruling is likely to resonate in Chicago Los Angeles Philadelphia and many other American cities where the rising cost of pensions has been crowding out spending for public schools police departments and other services.         The judge made it clear that public employee pensions were not protected in a federal Chapter 9 bankruptcy even though the Michigan Constitution expressly protects them. åÛåÏPension benefits are a contractual right and are not entitled to any heightened protection in a municipal bankruptcyåÛå he said.         James E. Spiotto a lawyer with the firm Chapman & Cutler in Chicago who specializes in municipal bankruptcy and was not involved in the case said: åÛåÏNo bankruptcy court had ruled that before. It will be instructive.åÛå         For people in Detroit the birthplace of the Motown sound and of the American auto industry Judge RhodesåÛåªs decision that the city qualified for bankruptcy amounted to one more miserable if expected assessment of its woeful circumstances. The city has lost hundreds of thousands of residents the judge said only a third of its ambulances function and its Police Department closes less than 9 percent of cases.         åÛåÏThis once proud and prosperous city canåÛåªt pay its debtsåÛå said the judge who sits in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. åÛåÏItåÛåªs insolvent. ItåÛåªs eligible for bankruptcy. But it also has an opportunity for a fresh start.åÛå         Appeals were expected to be filed quickly. At least one union filed a notice of appeal on Tuesday and other unions and pension fund representatives said they were considering contesting the outcome as well. But the ruling also allows Kevyn D. Orr an emergency manager assigned in March by the state to oversee DetroitåÛåªs finances to proceed swiftly with a formal plan for starting over åÛåÓ a proposal to pay off only a portion of its $18 billion in debts and to restore essential services like streetlights to tolerable levels.         Mr. Orr said he intended to file the formal blueprint known as a åÛåÏplan of adjustmentåÛå by the first week of 2014. That plan could include efforts to spin off city departments to outside entities to sell city assets and to reinvest in failing city services. Mr. Orr has said his goal is to bring Detroit the nationåÛåªs largest city ever to find itself in bankruptcy out of the court process by next fall.         åÛåÏWe have some heavy work ahead of usåÛå Mr. Orr said Tuesday.         Around Detroit leaders sounded somber but mildly hopeful tones. Mayor-elect Mike Duggan said that Tuesday was a day no one wanted to see but that the city now needed to move forward. And Dave Bing the departing mayor whose tenure in office has been consumed by the financial distress said it was inevitable that Detroit would ultimately be found insolvent. åÛåÏWe are now starting from Square 1åÛå he said.         Municipal workers and retirees said they were shaken by the developments and unsure what to expect. Any cut to pensions many said would be crushing.         åÛåÏThe impact of this is going to be catastrophic on families like mine on fixed incomeåÛå said Brendan Milewski 34 a Detroit firefighter who was seriously injured in an arson in 2010 and said he received a pension of $2800 a month from the city. åÛåÏRetirees are going to be put out of house and home. TheyåÛåªre not going to be able to afford a car food or medicine.åÛå         Bruce Babiarz a spokesman for the Detroit Police and Fire Retirement System was blunt in his assessment. åÛåÏThis is one of the strongest protected pension obligations in the country here in MichiganåÛå he said. åÛåÏIf this ruling is upheld this is the canary in a coal mine for protected pension benefits across the country. TheyåÛåªre gone.åÛå

But a year after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office an idea that some thought might be an easy win for immigration reform while meeting a stated aim of Abe's growth strategy has made no apparent progress.         If Abe's government drags its feet on one small step it suggests scant prospects for any broader measures to let in foreign workers any time soon - which many experts say will be necessary for Japan to sustain its economic growth in the face of a rapidly shrinking workforce.         ""Japan needs to let in more foreign workers to solve its population problem"" said Hidenori Sakanaka former head of the Tokyo Immigration Bureau. ""Letting in more domestic workers is just a small part of the big picture but it might make a big difference to the people who employ them.""         The proposal has been discussed by three ministries people familiar with the process say although Abe has not publicly mentioned the idea. Loosening visa requirements for domestic helpers could allow more Japanese women to return to full-time work proponents say.         That is one goal in a broader Abe strategy to get Japan on the path of stable economic expansion after almost two decades of debilitating deflation and sluggish growth.         But after Abe won plaudits for pushing aggressive fiscal and monetary expansion after coming to power last December reaction to his longer-term economic growth plans has been less enthusiastic.         His immigration-reform plans would make it easier for highly skilled immigrants to get work visas and cut the time needed to qualify for permanent residency. This falls short of the comprehensive steps needed to address the country's shrinking birthrate and burgeoning elderly population experts say.         TAKING JOBS         A quarter of Japan's population is already over 65 and that will increase to almost 40 percent by 2050. Ominously the number of people aged 18 to 24 has shrunk by nearly a third over the past two decades.         Japan will need 10 million immigrants over the next half century to offset its projected population decline said Sakanaka who founded the Japan Immigration Policy Institute think tank after retiring from the bureaucracy.         Officials say changes will take time and might not be as easy as they appear on the surface.         ""Before Japan decides to let in more foreign workers for certain jobs we must first determine whether there are Japanese citizens who could do such jobs"" said Yusuke Takeuchi deputy planning director in the Immigration Bureau at Japan's Ministry of Justice.         The tangle of issues involved in employing foreign workers as housekeepers or nannies helps to illustrate the labyrinthine task Japan would face if it were to try to tackle much broader immigration reform.         There are no clear statistics on the number of foreign household helpers in Japan as many are working informally and those working legally do so under a broad visa category. But foreign workers themselves say their numbers are shrinking.         ""It has gotten much harder since I first came in 1990 on a tourist visa to look for work"" said a 69-year-old housekeeper from the Philippines. She has a work visa - but on a passport bearing her dead sister's name.         She said she was forced to leave Japan a few years ago because authorities learnt she was no longer employed by her previous visa sponsor. So she said she was forced to resort to using her late sister's unblemished paperwork to get back into Japan.         Her employer an American executive had hoped to hire a Japanese housekeeper.         ""I couldn't find anyone who would commit to full-time work and was willing to perform multiple job duties from childcare to cleaning to marketing"" she said.        "

In an age when artisanal items can be sold at a premium what products should qualify as åÛåÏhandmadeåÛå?         This is the problem confronting executives at Etsy the online marketplace for all things vintage and handmade which has not allowed factory-made products to be sold on its site since it was founded in 2005.         But last month Etsy announced new policies that would allow sellers to apply to peddle items they produced with manufacturing partners as well as to hire staff and use outside companies to ship their goods åÛåÓ all provided that the sellers demonstrated the åÛåÏauthorship responsibility and transparencyåÛå intrinsic to handmade items.         By easing the definition of åÛåÏhandmadeåÛå Etsy is trying to accommodate individual vendors who are having more and more trouble keeping up with their growing volume of customers. But many Etsy users are outraged by what they see as EtsyåÛåªs abandonment of its commitment to human handicraft with some jumping ship for purer artisan sites like Zibbet.         Yet EtsyåÛåªs latest move is entirely in line with the history of handmade goods a history that is more complicated than the simple term åÛåÏhandmadeåÛå implies. The artisans have run head-on into the problem that led to the Industrial Revolution: Making things by hand is slow. Really slow.         Nearly 4000 years ago when Assyrian women wove fancy cloth for their menfolk to sell hundreds of miles away in what is now Turkey the problem was already there. We have the womenåÛåªs letters to prove it.         åÛåÏAbout the fact that I did not send you the textiles about which you wrote your heart should not be angryåÛå wrote one wife as translated by the Assyriologist Klaas Veenhof. She couldnåÛåªt finish the textiles because she had to stop and weave new outfits for her daughteråÛåªs coming-of-age ceremony åÛåÓ but åÛåÏwhatever textiles I can manage I will send you with later caravans.åÛå         Like the Etsy artisans these women worked for their own profits. They liked to keep them too. In one letter a wife asked her husband to hide the silver she earned inside a bale of wool to avoid notice by the tax collector. With their profits these women ran their households and bought raw materials åÛåÓ which sometimes included slave girls to increase production åÛåÓ to make more cloth. After all handmade goods require many hands; machines there were none.         Unless you call the hand loom a machine. The ancient Assyrian loom already had mechanical aids in the form of a complex of wooden bars and thread loops to open the passages for the weft thread to go across the cloth. The women no longer had to use their fingers to part each pair of threads.         And what about the hand spindle a mere stick with a bit of pottery or an apple stuck on the end? Its whirling speeds up the process of thread-spinning enormously. But spinning the thread took much longer than weaving it. (At least one Middle Kingdom Egyptian wall painting of cloth-making shows a worker saying to the thread-makers åÛåÏHurry up!åÛå) It was that bottleneck åÛåÓ lack of thread for the weavers åÛåÓ that led to some of the most important machines of the Industrial Revolution such as the spinning jenny.         Since then machines have essentially made all the thread and yarn we buy to knit and crochet and sew our handmade sweaters doilies and dresses.         Oops. Are those crafts then notÌâåÊåÛåÏhandmadeåÛå?         I have friends hand-weavers who spin their yarn from hand-processed fiber. But they use a spinning wheel a labor-saving invention developed in the Middle Ages. Does that yarn not count as handmade?         Using a spinning wheel to make thread does seem quaint and old-fashioned enough to qualify especially set against the giant mills of today. But by that logic everything made by an earlier outmoded technology could count as handmade.         The truth is that almost none of the objects that we think of as handmade truly are. And that has been the case for thousands of years åÛåÓ long before Etsy announced this latest change to its website.         A fully handmade item like the fragment of Egyptian linen from 2500 B.C. that I came across in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston is a testament to human skill. Fine as silk 200 threads to the inch the linen had been hand-split and spliced end to end to make the thread.         But that kind of artistry is a rare treasure today as time is short and machines ranging from the simple to the complex are with us to stay. Ultimately it is the human care effort and ingenuity used to create an object that is important and not whether it fits the exact definition of åÛåÏhandmade.åÛå         Just because an object includes manufactured parts doesnåÛåªt mean it canåÛåªt reflect the touch of an individual creatoråÛåªs hand: the subtly uneven knit the finger-marked clay and all the other happy unmechanical surprises of human quirkiness.

Instead the irate caller accusing the store of anti-Islamic behavior was a frequent shopper a woman who on average spent $13000 per visit.         åÛåÏMaybe I should get whale soundsåÛå said the princess Reema Bint Bandar al-Saud making light of the blowback that businesspeople in this intensely religious and conservative kingdom often face when making even glacial changes to How Things Are Done.         But this is part of being a pioneer in Saudi Arabia where women are severely restricted in all public activities and are treated as the wards of their male relatives. Despite her royal credentials the princess did away with the music but has pushed ahead on the equally touchy front of hiring women as salesclerks. This step åÛåÓ or leap in the Saudi context åÛåÓ seeks to not only shift social conventions but also to aid the countryåÛåªs long-term economic health.         At Harvey Nichols several dozen female clerks were spread throughout the store on a recent visit all cloaked in black their hair covered some with only their eyes peering through narrow slits in face veils. They were busy arranging dresses hawking cosmetics and swiping credit cards.         Just two years ago there were only a few women working here.         The kingdomåÛåªs restrictions on women have long drawn the condemnation of rights groups most recently after dozens of women drew headlines by defying a ban on  driving .         But some womenåÛåªs rights advocates here say that the international attention given to small numbers of women getting behind the wheel overshadows the deep if gradual shifts in Saudi society as more women work broadening their range of experience helping to run organizations and earning a degree of economic independence.         Although the effort has been promoted by the Ministry of Labor as part of a campaign to reduce unemployment and the dependence on foreign workers it has butted up against strict social codes. The percentage of Saudi women who work remains minuscule by world standards at about 15 percent.         Still many employers say they prefer hiring Saudi women to Saudi men; they have added separate break rooms and office areas for women and have installed partitions and cameras to prevent unwelcome mingling.         åÛåÏWe are promoting recruitment of Saudi women because they have a low level of attrition a better attention to detail a willingness to perform and a productivity about twice that of Saudi menåÛå said a grocery store manager with branches throughout the kingdom.         Despite that Saudi women make up less than 5 percent of his staff of more than 1000 because of social taboos in many areas. He spoke on the condition that neither he nor his company be identified to avoid being targeted by opponents of womenåÛåªs employment.         While working women in the Red Sea city of Jidda are relatively accepted he said the addition of female checkout clerks in a more conservative city caused such an uproar that a local prince intervened and paid the womenåÛåªs salaries for more than a year åÛåÓ as long as they stayed home.         Others have found business opportunities in bridging the gap between employers and women.         åÛåÏFor some employers it is their first time to hire women and they donåÛåªt know how to deal with themåÛå said Khalid Alkhudair 30 who runs a womenåÛåªs employment service called Glowork that cooperates with the government to increase female employment.         Frosted-glass partitions bearing inspirational quotes divide the companyåÛåªs pink-walled office in Riyadh. On a recent morning a dozen female employees sipped coffee as they sorted through applicantsåÛåª rÌÄå©sumÌÄå©s on flat-screen monitors. All wore loose black gowns some with their hair uncovered åÛåÓ a rare but increasingly common sight in some private offices.         In two years the company has found jobs for more than 10000 women including one chief financial officer several human resource managers and a group of women at a light bulb factory Mr. Alkhudair said.         Yet across the kingdom about two-thirds of female university graduates are unemployed showing that the labor market has yet to catch up with huge advances in womenåÛåªs education.         Some Saudis laud King Abdullah as a reformer for appointing 30 women to a royal advisory council and granting women the right to run and vote in municipal elections.

Now it wants the corporations too.         The search giant has for years been evasive about its plans for a so-called public cloud of computers and data storage that is rented to individuals and businesses. On Tuesday however it will announce pricing features and performance guarantees aimed at companies ranging from start-ups to multinationals.         It is the latest salvo in an escalating battle among some of the most influential companies in technology to control corporate and government computing through public clouds. That battle which is expected to last years and cost the competitors billions of dollars annually in material and talent already includes Microsoft IBM and Amazon.         As businesses move from owning their own computers to renting data-crunching power and software over the Internet this resource-rich foursome is making big promises about computing clouds. Supercomputing-based research for example wonåÛåªt be limited to organizations that can afford supercomputers. And tech companies with a hot idea will be able to get big fast because they wonåÛåªt have to build their own computer networks.         Take Snapchat the photo-swapping service that recently turned down a multibillion-dollar takeover offer from Facebook. It processes 4000 pictures a second on GoogleåÛåªs servers but is just two years old and has fewer than 30 employees. The company started out working with a Google service that helps young companies create applications and was chosen by Google to be an early customer of its cloud.         Working with Google has allowed Snapchat to avoid spending a lot to support its users. åÛåÏIåÛåªve never owned a computer serveråÛå said Bobby Murphy a co-founder and the chief technical officer of Snapchat.         That is a big shift from the days when for young companies knowing how to build a complex data center was just as important as creating a popular service.         åÛåÏThese things are incredibly fast åÛåÓ setting up new servers in a minute when it used to take several weeks to order install and teståÛå said Chris Gaun an analyst with Gartner. åÛåÏFinance product research crunching supercomputing data like genomic information can all happen faster.åÛå         AmazonåÛåªs cloud called Amazon Web Services was arguably the pioneer of the public cloud and for now is the largest player. Amazon says its cloud has åÛåÏhundreds of thousandsåÛå of customers. Though most of these are individuals and small businesses it also counts big names like Netflix which stopped building its own data centers in 2008 and was completely on AmazonåÛåªs cloud by 2012. All of AmazonåÛåªs services are run inside that cloud too.         A more traditional consumer goods company 3M uses MicrosoftåÛåªs public cloud called Azure to process images for 20000 individuals and companies in 50 countries to analyze various product designs. Microsoft says Azure handles 100 petabytes of data a day roughly 700 years of HD movies.         åÛåÏPeople started out building things on AmazonåÛåªs service but now there are a few big playersåÛå said Mr. Murphy. åÛåÏHopefully the time between an idea and its implementation can get even quicker.åÛå         Google is cutting prices for most of its services like online data storage and computer processing by 10 percent and its high-end data storage prices by 60 percent while offering access to larger and more complex computing systems. Google is also guaranteeing that critical projects will remain working 99.95 percent of the time far better performance than in most corporate data centers.         åÛåÏPeople make a mistake thinking this is just a version of the computers on their desks at a lower coståÛå said Greg DeMichillie director of GoogleåÛåªs public cloud platform. åÛåÏThis is lots of distributed computing intelligence not just in computers and phones but in cars in thermometers everywhere. The demand will only increase.åÛå

Here on a grassy expanse toward the south end of Hart Island off the Bronx the trenches are 10 feet deep and as long as a football field. They fill up steadily with the dead åÛåÓ the homeless poor stillborn and other unclaimed bodies åÛåÓ delivered by truck and ferry from all over New York City for unceremonious interment.         The current trench should be filled before Christmas. Then the gravediggers a cadre of inmates bused over from Rikers Island on Tuesdays through Fridays will begin sowing the next crop of caskets in a pit freshly dug and running adjacent said Capt. Martin Thompson of the cityåÛåªs  Correction Department  which manages operations on the island.         His crews follow a grim arithmetic: up to 1500 bodies buried a year organized into 70-foot-long plots that with caskets stacked three-high in rows of six can hold about 150 adults each or 1000 infants who are buried in trenches separate from the adults. On this 101-acre island the number of burials since 1869 now approaches one million.         The tour on Tuesday was the first time a reporter had been allowed near the burial site in years despite the many requests the department receives. And even that went only so far. Though correction officials had earlier consented to a viewing of burials they announced just before departing on the ferry from City Island that no bodies would be arriving on that day after all. They later said that since the previous day  Veterans Day  was a city holiday no bodies had been prepared for delivery.         Keeping tight restrictions on burial information and visitation has long been a priority for the department but recent developments suggest the beginning of a change in policy.         For years correction officials arranged  sporadic memorial services conducted by advocacy groups  and they have allowed åÛåÏclosure visitsåÛå since 2007 for family members of people buried on the island. Those take place at a gazebo the agency built for mourners near the ferry dock well away from the burial areas and with no view of the graves. Originally ferry service was by appointment only and exclusively for relatives possessing a death certificate of a loved one. More recently the department dropped the requirement that visitors be related to a buried loved one and instituted monthly ferry service but it still let visitors go no farther than the gazebo.         This month the departmentåÛåªs lawyers approved a special request by a group of eight women seeking to visit their infantsåÛåª grave sites on the island. Faced with a lawsuit the agency notified Mark Taylor a Manhattan lawyer representing the women pro bono that the visits would soon be granted albeit with tight restrictions.         Mr. Taylor said he was amazed that the visits were granted. The agencyåÛåªs decision he said would serve as a precedent to pave the way for similar requests.         åÛåÏOnce granted itåÛåªs hard for them legally to go backåÛå he said. åÛåÏIt would be very difficult for them to deny it to others.åÛå         Agency officials in the past have emphasized the need to keep the island restricted because of dangerous conditions security concerns regarding the inmate laborers and the lack of amenities and utilities including restrooms on the island. A compound for inmates and correction officers does have a propane-fueled kitchen restrooms and an active water main connected to the mainland but it is off-limits to visitors encircled by a fence topped with razor wire.         On the island a lush overgrowth of greenery envelops crumbling buildings that reflect the islandåÛåªs history åÛåÓ a chronology that includes uses as a Civil War prison a lunatic asylum a tuberculosis hospital and a boysåÛåª reformatory.         No-trespassing signs ring the islandåÛåªs rocky and sandy shorelines even as recreational fishermen and day-sailors ply the waters just off its shores.         A spokesman for the department would not comment on Hart Island issues and would not permit a photographer on the island; the reporter had to leave his camera and phone behind during the visit.         Advocates for opening up Hart Island question the use of inmate labor to perform burials and argue that personnel hired and trained to oversee the cityåÛåªs jail system are ill-equipped to run a cemetery and interact with bereaved loved ones.         Restrictions designed to prevent security breaches they say lead to difficulty finding information on the dead and limit opportunities for visitation. Advocates also argue that the rules stigmatize the visiting process with relatives of the dead being treated like prisoners rather than mourners.

Never mind that the new provider network would eliminate coverage for my and my sonåÛåªs long-term doctors and hospitals.         The Anthem rep cheerily explained that despite the companyåÛåªs åÛåÓ I paraphrase åÛåÓ draconian rates and limited network my benefits which also include maternity coverage (handy for a 46-year-old) would åÛåÏbe actually much richer.åÛå         I of course would be actually much poorer. And it was this aspect of the bum deal that to my surprise turned out to be a very unpopular thing to gripe about.         åÛåÏObamacare or Kafkacare?åÛå I posted on Facebook as soon as I hung up with Anthem. I vented about the call and wrote that the president should be protecting the middle class not making our lives substantially harder. For extra sympathy I may have thrown in the fact that IåÛåªm a single mom. (O.K. I did.)         Then I sat back and waited for the love to pour in. Or at least the åÛåÏlike.åÛå Lots of likes. After all I have 1037 Facebook friends. Surely theyåÛåªd commiserate.         Except that they didnåÛåªt.         Instead aside from my friend David who attempted to cheer me up with åÛåÏMy dad who never turns down a bargain would take the sex change just because itåÛåªs freeåÛå my respondents implied åÛåÓ in posts that to my annoyance kept getting more åÛåÏlikesåÛå åÛåÓ that it was beyond uncool to be whining about myself when the less fortunate would finally have insurance.         åÛåÏThe nation has been better offåÛå wrote one friend. åÛåÏOver 33 million people who did not have insurance are now going to get it.åÛå ThatåÛåªs all fine and good for åÛåÏthe nationåÛå but what about my $5400 rate hike (after-tax dollars I wanted to add but dared not in this group of previously closeted Mother Teresas)? Another friend wrote åÛåÏYes IåÛåªm paying an extra 200 a month but IåÛåªm okay with doing that so that others who need it can have health care.åÛå         I was shocked. Who knew my friends were such humanitarians? Has Obamacare made it un-P.C. to be concerned by a serious burden on my familyåÛåªs well-being?         The heated reactions even moved offline. Frustrated I observed to one friend who was covered through her work that when an issue didnåÛåªt affect people directly they became åÛåÏtheoretically generous.åÛå Ask them to donate several thousand dollars so that the less fortunate can have medical insurance åÛåÓ which is exactly what President Obama is asking me to do åÛåÓ and IåÛåªll bet theyåÛåªd change their tune about åÛåÏending inequalityåÛå and åÛåÏcreating fairnessåÛå and åÛåÏdoing whatåÛåªs good for the country.åÛå         Refreshingly the two people who showed real empathy were my insurance broker and my friend Nicole who sent daily links to news stories about people who were also stripped of their coverage and mandated to buy expensive exchange or private policies without access to their current doctors yet just missed the cutoff for subsidies.         There was one story about people suing Anthem for not being grandfathered in after changing their policies post-2010. In fact it was in 2011 that I altered mine dumping maternity benefits so that I didnåÛåªt have to pay for everyone elseåÛåªs pregnancies. Little did I know IåÛåªd end up losing my insurance  and  paying for everyone elseåÛåªs pregnancies.         There was even an article about a cancer patient who had lost access to her doctors. To her credit Nicole refrained from saying åÛåÏBut Lori this woman has cancer and you are so much more fortunate!åÛå         Like Bridget JonesåÛåªs åÛåÏsmug marriedsåÛå the åÛåÏsmug insuredsåÛå åÛåÓ friends who were covered through their own or spousesåÛåª employers or who were grandfathered into their plans åÛåÓ asked why I didnåÛåªt åÛåÏjuståÛå switch all of our long-term doctors suck it up and pay an extra $200 a month for a restrictive network on the exchange or marry the guy IåÛåªm dating. How romantic: åÛåÏI didnåÛåªt marry you just to save money honey. I married you for your provider network.åÛå         Along with the smug insureds President Obama doesnåÛåªt care much about the relatively small percentage of us with canceled coverage and no viable replacement. He keeps apologizing while maintaining that itåÛåªs for the good of the country a vast improvement åÛåÏover all.åÛå         And the åÛåÏover allåÛå might agree. But the self-employed middle class is being sacrificed at the altar of politically correct rhetoric with nobody helping to ensure our health fiscal or otherwise because itåÛåªs trendy to cheer for the underdog. Embracing the noble cause is all very well åÛåÓ as long as yours isnåÛåªt the åÛåÏfortunateåÛå family that loses its access to comprehensive affordable health care while the rest of the nation gets it.         The truly noble act here is being performed by my friend Nicole who keeps posting Obamacare fiasco stories on my Facebook page despite being conspicuously ignored except for my single åÛåÏlike.åÛå ItåÛåªs the lone åÛåÏlikeåÛå that falls in the forest the click nobody wants to hear.

As far back as the 2nd century B.C. the Roman playwright Plautus lamented åÛåÏThe gods confound the man who first found out how to distinguish the hours!åÛå as he railed against the cityåÛåªs central sundial which served to åÛåÏcut and hack my days so wretchedly.åÛå Thousands of years later what would Plautus make of this ringing dinging world full of productivity apps that hack ever deeper into our days and nights?         The clock rose to power conjointly with a mounting yearning for certainty and order dividing time with increasing accuracy into neat units that could be accounted for spent saved or wasted. Yet while our contemporary zeal to Get Things Done (GTD) might spur efficiency it comes at a cost. What could be gained from a single day set free from the clockåÛåªs tyranny one spent wandering or daydreaming the hours away?         In the modern age weåÛåªve lost our taste for unfragmented time the sort that Robert Louis Stevenson loved. He relished a day spent unaware of the hour walking pondering and lingering at the side of the road whenever the mood struck. During that drift it seemed åÛåÏalmost as if the millennium were arrived when we shall throw out clocks and watches over the housetop and remember time and seasons no moreåÛå he wrote in 1876. åÛåÏYou have no idea unless you have tried it how endlessly long is a summeråÛåªs day that you measure out only by hunger and bring to an end only when you are drowsy.åÛå         Over the centuries the illusion of mastering time through obedience to it came into acceptance. Across Europe the medieval monasteryåÛåªs bell tolled as a reminder to eat sleep and pray. But while there must have been some soulåÛåªs release in relinquishing earthly sovereignty to that sound as the clockåÛåªs authority spread we sealed all the gaps through which curiosity might seep into our days. Curiosity after all could lure the susceptible way off track as the Italian poet Petrarch learned in the spring of 1336 when he famously climbed Mont Ventoux motivated by åÛåÏnothing but the desire to see its conspicuous height.åÛå One of the texts he carried along was Saint AugustineåÛåªs åÛåÏConfessionsåÛå detailing the moral dangers of such expeditions when men åÛåÏgo out to admire the mountainsåÛå or the course of the stars and therein forget themselves. Chastened Petrarch made his descent in silence.         Only the Enlightenment redeemed our penchant to while away the hours in wonder. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes called curiosity the åÛåÏsingular passionåÛå separating humans from animals. Even better it was åÛåÏa Lust of the mind that by a perseverance of delight in the continual and indefatigable generation of Knowledge exceedeth the short vehemence of any carnal Pleasure.åÛå What pleasure we might know by letting curiosity have its way with us for an hour or two.         Devices that constantly keep us on course fixed in place and in time åÛåÓ from the GPS to Siri åÛåÓ ruin our ability to get lost eradicating randomness and its magic in their wake. Perhaps no one knew this better than FranceåÛåªs early-19th century flÌÄå¢neurs the idle walkers who happily unspooled their days into the unknown or the flÌÄå¢neursåÛåª lowbrow American confreres the tramp poets of the early 20th century who surrendered to their surroundings with even more conviction than time-bound monks. In the summer of 1912 the poet Vachel Lindsay set off tramping in a corduroy suit walking and åÛåÏmeditating on the ways of DestinyåÛå while preaching the åÛåÏGospel of BeautyåÛå to everyone he met from Springfield Illinois to Missouri and Kansas and into Colorado and New Mexico. Sure he often went hungry but åÛåÏsleeping in a hayloft is Romance itselfåÛå Lindsay wrote. åÛåÏThe alfalfa is soft and fragrant and clean the wind blows through the big loft doors the stars shine through the cottonwoods.åÛå He couldnåÛåªt have cared less about making good time between point A and B.

Now computer software is using frame-by-frame video analysis to read subtle muscular changes that flash across our faces in milliseconds signaling emotions like happiness sadness and disgust.         With face-reading software a computeråÛåªs webcam might spot the confused expression of an online student and provide extra tutoring. Or computer-based games with built-in cameras could register how people are reacting to each move in the game and ramp up the pace if they seem bored.         But the rapidly developing technology is far from infallible and it raises many questions about privacy and surveillance.         Ever since Darwin scientists have systematically analyzed facial expressions finding that many of them are universal. Humans are remarkably consistent in the way their noses wrinkle say or their eyebrows move as they experience certain emotions. People can be trained to note tiny changes in facial muscles learning to distinguish common expressions by studying photographs and video. Now computers can be programmed to make those distinctions too.         Companies in this field include  Affectiva  based in Waltham Mass. and  Emotient  based in San Diego. Affectiva used webcams over two and a half years to accumulate and classify about 1.5 billion emotional reactions from people who gave permission to be recorded as they watched streaming video said Rana el-Kaliouby the companyåÛåªs co-founder and chief science officer. These recordings served as a database to create the companyåÛåªs face-reading software which it will offer to mobile software developers starting in mid-January.         The company strongly believes that people should give their consent to be filmed and it will approve and control all of the apps that emerge from its algorithms Dr. Kaliouby said.         Face-reading technology may one day be paired with programs that have complementary ways of recognizing emotion  such as software that analyzes peopleåÛåªs voices  said  Paul Saffo  a technology forecaster. If computers reach the point where they can combine facial coding voice sensing gesture tracking and gaze tracking he said a less stilted way of interacting with machines will ensue.         For some this type of technology raises an Orwellian specter. And Affectiva is aware that its face-reading software could stir privacy concerns. But Dr. Kaliouby said that none of the coming apps using its software could record video of peopleåÛåªs faces.         åÛåÏThe software uses its algorithms to read your expressionsåÛå she said åÛåÏbut it doesnåÛåªt store the frames.åÛå         So far the companyåÛåªs algorithms have been used mainly to monitor peopleåÛåªs expressions as a way to test ads movie trailers and television shows in advance. (It is much cheaper to use a program to analyze faces than to hire people who have been trained in face-reading.)         AffectivaåÛåªs clients include Unilever Mars and Coca-Cola. The advertising research agency  Millward Brown  says it has used AffectivaåÛåªs technology to test about 3000 ads for clients.         Face-reading software is unlikely to infer precise emotions 100 percent of the time said Tadas Baltrusaitis a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cambridge  who has written papers  on the automatic analysis of facial expressions. The algorithms have improved but åÛåÏthey are not perfect and probably never will beåÛå he said.         Apps that can respond to facial cues may find wide use in education gaming medicine and advertising said  Winslow Burleson  an assistant professor of human-computer interaction at Arizona State University. åÛåÏOnce we can package this facial analysis in small devices and connect to the cloudåÛå he said åÛåÏwe can provide just-in-time information that will help individuals moment to moment throughout their lives.åÛå         People with autism who can have a hard time reading facial expressions may be among the beneficiaries Dr. Burleson said. By wearing Google Glass or other Internet-connected goggles with cameras they could get clues to the reactions of the people with whom they were talking åÛåÓ clues that could come via an earpiece as the program translates facial expressions.         But facial-coding technology raises privacy concerns as more and more of societyåÛåªs interactions are videotaped said Ginger McCall a lawyer and privacy advocate in Washington.         åÛåÏThe unguarded expressions that flit across our faces arenåÛåªt always the ones we want other people to readily identifyåÛå Ms. McCall said åÛåÓ for example during a job interview. åÛåÏWe rely to some extent on the transience of those facial expressions.åÛå         She added: åÛåÏPrivate companies are developing this technology now. But you can be sure government agencies especially in security are taking an interest too.åÛå         Ms. McCall cited several government reports including a  National Defense Research Institute report  this year that discusses the technology and its possible applications in  airport security  screening.         She said the programs could be acceptable for some uses such as dating services as long as people agreed in advance to have webcams watch and analyze the emotions reflected in their faces. åÛåÏBut without consentåÛå Ms. McCall said åÛåÏthey are problematic åÛåÓ and this is a technology that could easily be implemented without a personåÛåªs knowledge.åÛå

Podesta a former chief of staff for President  Bill Clinton .         Mr. Podesta who has agreed to serve as counselor for a year led Mr. ObamaåÛåªs presidential transition in 2008 and has been an outside adviser since then. He also has occasionally criticized the administration if gently from his perch as the founder and former president of the Center for American Progress a center-left public policy research group that has provided personnel and policy ideas to the administration.         Word that Mr. Podesta would for the first time join Mr. ObamaåÛåªs official staff from people familiar with the discussions comes as the president is seeking to recover public support and credibility after the flawed introduction in October of the insurance marketplaces that are a key part of his signature Affordable Care Act. This week he brought back his former chief congressional lobbyist Phil Schiliro who had moved to New Mexico to help on the health care issues.         Mr. PodestaåÛåªs recruitment by Mr. ObamaåÛåªs chief of staff Denis McDonough also comes as Mr. Obama faces a number of departures by close advisers in the coming months.         Among those exiting is his longtime confidant and troubleshooter Pete Rouse who has been with Mr. Obama since the future president was elected a senator in 2004. For a few months in late 2010 Mr. Rouse was Mr. ObamaåÛåªs acting chief of staff.         Mr. Podesta will help Mr. McDonough on matters related to the  health care law  administration organization and executive actions said a person familiar with the plans and will focus in particular on climate change issues a personal priority of Mr. PodestaåÛåªs.         The White House refused to confirm the recruitment of Mr. Podesta. The person familiar with the matter saidÌâåÊMr. PodestaÌâåÊwould notÌâåÊbe replacing Mr. RouseÌâåÊwho is said to have a unique relationship with the president after their years together in the Senate two presidential campaigns and the White House.         Even so Mr. Podesta and Mr. Rouse share some similarities. Both are older than the 52-year-old president åÛåÓ Mr. Rouse is 67 Mr. Podesta nearly 65 åÛåÓ and are said to be able to speak candidly to him much like party elders.         Both also have far more Washington experience than Mr. Obama. Each has spent many years as a senior Senate aide including postings with Tom Daschle of South Dakota when he was the Senate Democratic leader. Both Mr. Rouse and Mr. Podesta have close relationships with senators valuable experience going into a midterm election year when the DemocratsåÛåª majority in the Senate is threatened.         Mr. Podesta did not respond to requests for comment. It appeared the White House had reached out to him recently.         In mid-November Mr. Podesta announced that he was establishing the Washington Center for Equitable Growth a nonpartisan organization within the Center for American Progress and that he would be its chairman.         The new group will study the growing inequality in incomes and economic opportunity and promote policies to close a gap that has worsened to levels last seen in the 1920s. Inequality has long been a focus of Mr. ObamaåÛåªs and has figured prominently in his speeches since he was a state senator in Illinois. Last week he spoke at a community complex in a struggling Washington neighborhood where he called inequality and declining upward mobility åÛåÏthe defining issue of our time.åÛå         His host for the event was the Center for American Progress and Mr. Podesta attended.         Mr. Podesta who was Mr. ClintonåÛåªs chief of staff during the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the impeachment of Mr. Clinton also has been at the center of foreign policy and national security debates. In 2009 he accompanied Mr. Clinton to North Korea for negotiations that won the release of two American journalists who had been jailed on spy charges.

Ming Suan Zhang 42 pleaded guilty on August 19 to one count of violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for trying to export aerospace-grade carbon fiber a controlled commodity without a license.         U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn sentenced Zhang to 57 months in prison the top end of the 46- to 57-month range recommended under federal guidelines.         Zhang has been in federal custody since his arrest in September 2012 and could face deportation after his release.         ""The defendant brazenly disregarded U.S. law in an attempt to procure a highly sought after commodity and provide it to a foreign power"" U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch in Brooklyn said in a statement.         The carbon fiber composite that Zhang sought is regulated by the U.S. Department of Commerce and can be used to make ballistic missiles and nuclear centrifuges.         It is also used in military and commercial aircraft including the  Boeing 787 Dreamliner  to make planes stronger lighter and more resistant to stress.         Prosecutors said they began probing Zhang after a man and woman in Taiwan acting on his behalf in April 2012 sought to buy several tons of carbon fiber via the Internet.         They said Zhang later told an undercover agent that he needed the material fast because a customer a Chinese military executive was involved in testing a new ""fighter aircraft.""         The Zhang was arrested after traveling to the United States to meet the agent.         Zhang had sought to be sentenced to time served. His lawyer Mingli Chen said Zhang manufactured sports equipment and wanted carbon fiber for some of his products such as hockey sticks.         ""The sentencing was heavy"" Chen said in an interview. ""My client was trying to make up a loss from a failing business and I don't believe he was trying to send carbon fiber for any use in the Chinese aerospace or military industry.""

Five years ago if IåÛåªd told people I worked on toilets they would have surely assumed I was a plumber. Now they exclaim: åÛåÏOh! IsnåÛåªt Bill Gates into that?åÛå         More than one-third of the worldåÛåªs population approximately 2.5 billion people doesnåÛåªt have access to a toilet. The Gates Foundation and a handful of celebrities like Matt Damon deserve credit for putting this sanitation crisis on the map.         The trouble is that the Gates Foundation has treated the quest to find the proper solution as it would a cutting-edge project at Microsoft: lots of bells and whistles sky-high budgets and engineers in elite institutions experimenting with the newest technologies thousands of miles away from their clients.         Just consider some of the parameters of the Gates FoundationåÛåªs first Reinvent the Toilet Challenge: Create a åÛåÏpracticalåÛå toilet that is suitable for a single-family residence in the developing world. Make sure it takes in the bodily waste of an entire family and outputs drinkable water and condiments like salt. And while youåÛåªre at it make sure that the toilet is microprocessor-supervised and converts feces into energy. And all this has to cost just pennies per person per day. ThatåÛåªs some toilet.         The winner of last yearåÛåªs contest invented a solar-powered toilet that converts poop into energy for cooking. Impressive åÛåÓ but each one costs $1000.         Other models boasted membrane systems treatment of fecal sludge using supercritical water oxidation (heating water to 705 degrees Fahrenheit or 374 degrees Celsius then injecting oxygen) and hydrothermal carbonization (oxidizing feces at a high temperature and high pressure while under water).         High-tech toilets are exciting but even the Gates Foundation has admitted that åÛåÏthe economics of such a solution remain uncertain.åÛå In plain English: No one can afford them.         They are beyond impractical for those who need them most: the residents of slums in countries like Haiti Indonesia and Bangladesh where people make between $1 and $5 per day.         Just imagine the fate of a high-tech toilet in one of these communities. What happens if the unique membrane systems get clogged? Or if the supercritical water vessel or the hydrothermal carbonization tank leaks or worse explodes? Or what if one of the impoverished residents realizes the device is worth more than a yearåÛåªs earnings and decides to steal it? If the many failed development projects of the past 60 years have taught us anything itåÛåªs that complicated imported solutions do not work.         The people IåÛåªve met in countries like Peru El Salvador and Haiti tend to be subsistence farmers in the countryside or residents of big-city slums who do odd jobs to make ends meet. They are survivors. They make use of what they have and are often very good at fixing things. But donåÛåªt ask them to become industrial engineers overnight.         When I listen to Mr. Gates talk toilets I think of Juana who lives in BelÌÄå©n Peru a city of 65000 on a tributary of the Amazon River. Her neighborhood is under water half the year. During the other half the drainage ditches are filled with excrement and rats.         When Juana needs to relieve herself she walks on a narrow plank for about 30 feet until she arrives at her bathroom åÛåÓ four rotting wooden posts wrapped with a tarp. She stands precariously on two narrow slats perched above a ditch and does what she needs to do. She also knows that her kids play nearby and worries about their getting sick since the waste goes directly into a stream.         Poor sanitation contributes to 2000 childhood deaths from diarrheal diseases every day. Unfortunately for Juana and the millions of people who live on marginal waterlogged land there are no cheap solutions available. What they need are the kind of toilets that they can buy or build with a few weeksåÛåª savings.         Ecological toilets that use natural composting to break down waste are simple to construct waterless and are easy to fix. This is the go-to toilet for cottage owners in America who live too close to the water to have a septic system.         The only problem is theyåÛåªre too expensive with price tags of over $1000. In Haiti an organization called SOIL has successfully brought low-cost composting toilets to over 20000 people and my organization is working on developing a more affordable version.         Even simple solutions like the Peepoo bag which inexpensively (less than 2 cents per bag) sanitizes waste before turning it into fertilizer are huge improvements. They can also be critical in saving lives after natural disasters.         If we embrace these low-tech toilets weåÛåªll be on the right track to getting 2.5 billion people one step closer to a safe clean comfortable and affordable toilet of their own. ThatåÛåªs something worth celebrating this World Toilet Day.

By a vote of 56 to 41 the nomination of Cornelia T. L. Pillard a Georgetown law professor fell short of clearing the necessary 60-vote threshold.         Ms. PillardåÛåªs liberal record on issues like abortion has troubled many conservatives who are concerned about her attaining a position on a court widely considered second in stature to only the Supreme Court. But Senate Republicans have tried to frame their opposition to her not in terms of her views on social issues instead focusing on the caseload at the court the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit which is lower than that of other federal appeals courts.         The disagreements carried over onto the Senate floor on Tuesday as Democrats accused Republicans of blocking a perfectly qualified woman for political purposes while Republicans said Democrats were desperately looking for a wedge issue.         Looming underneath their disagreements about Ms. Pillard is the likelihood åÛåÓ which appeared to grow considerably on Tuesday åÛåÓ that the fight will escalate and result in a change to the Senate rules to limit the minority partyåÛåªs ability to filibuster judicial nominees.         Senator Richard J. Durbin the chamberåÛåªs No. 2 Democrat warned Republicans that they were pushing the Senate dangerously close to a tipping point.         åÛåÏThere reaches a point where we canåÛåªt allow this type of injustice to occuråÛå he said all but threatening that Democrats would be forced to change the rules. åÛåÏItåÛåªs not fair to these nomineesåÛå he added åÛåÏto be given the back of the hand by a Republican filibuster on the floor of the United States Senate.åÛå         Senator Charles E. Grassley Republican of Iowa who is a senior member of the Judiciary Committee dared Democrats to change the rules saying it would come back to haunt them if they lost the majority.         åÛåÏGo aheadåÛå Mr. Grassley said. åÛåÏThere are a lot more Scalias and Thomases that weåÛåªd love to put on the benchåÛå referring to Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court.         Democrats have made much of the fact that two of the three nominees whom Republicans have rejected recently åÛåÓ and three of the filibustered nominees the president has submitted for the District of Columbia appeals court over the last year åÛåÓ were women. Mr. Grassley rejected the idea that sex played any role in opposition to the nominees.         åÛåÏWhen the other side runs out of legitimate arguments their last line of defense is to accuse Republicans of opposing nominees based upon gender or raceåÛå he said. åÛåÏItåÛåªs a well-worn card. And they play it every time.åÛå         The dispute has brought the Senate to the point of crisis twice this year. But this latest round has become especially intense because of the power of the court in question. It regularly decides cases that determine whether White House-issued regulations are constitutional. Just last week it ruled that the mandate in the Affordable Care Act for employers to provide free coverage for contraception infringes on individual religious liberty.         Social conservatives have seized on Ms. PillardåÛåªs published writings on abortion and motherhood in which she has staunchly defended a womanåÛåªs right to terminate a pregnancy as constitutionally protected. One writer for The National Review Online called her åÛåÏa pro-abortion extremist.åÛå         The nomination of one more judge to the appeals court could move to the Senate floor soon. Robert L. Wilkins a Federal District Court judge for the District of Columbia has already cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee and is awaiting a floor vote.         ÌâåÊBut Republicans have shown no willingness to approve him either. Speaking after the vote on Tuesday Senator Patrick J. Leahy Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Judiciary Committee said he believed it had come to the point when Senate filibuster rules must be changed because Republicans were holding the presidentåÛåªs nominees to such åÛåÏa blatant double standard.åÛå         Slamming his fist on a lectern he shouted åÛåÏTheir credibility is shredded!åÛå

It might have åÛåÏshape memoryåÛå to instantly mold to a specific man. Or it might come with pull tabs so a man could slip it on with little fuss.         Those ideas are among the winners announced Wednesday by the  Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  of a  contest to create a condom  that men would actually use. The contest the foundation said aimed to decrease unintended pregnancies and  sexually transmitted diseases  with åÛåÏa next-generation condom that significantly preserves or enhances pleasure.åÛå         The foundation received 812 applications chose 11 and awarded the winners $100000 each. They could receive up to $1 million after they develop the ideas. Steven Buchsbaum a Gates Foundation official said winners ranged from a longtime condom manufacturer in India to American chemical engineers to British design consultants whose previous work included vacuum cleaners.         Many ideas involved materials besides latex aiming for thinner stronger less constricting condoms with better sensation åÛåÏreducing the loving distance between partners so they will be more closeåÛå said Dr. Papa Salif Sow a Gates senior program officer. Other ideas focused on åÛåÏhow to improve the donningåÛå he said because åÛåÏin sub-Saharan Africa sex is basically done with low light and it might be very difficult to see the direction of the condom.åÛå         Winners include the åÛåÏultrasensitive reconstituted collagen condomåÛå proposed by Apex Medical Technologies in San Diego. ApexåÛåªs president Mark McGlothlin said his product would feel like skin and be made from collagen fibers from cowsåÛåª Achilles tendons or possibly fish skin.         åÛåÏTheyåÛåªre unbelievably strongåÛå said Mr. McGlothlin who currently gets beef tendon from a Vietnamese grocery. åÛåÏI could yank all day and not break this thing.åÛå         A åÛåÏwrapping condomåÛå proposal by the California Family Health Council in Los Angeles will build on a version manufactured in Colombia made of polyethylene plastic that åÛåÏclings like Saran Wrap rather than squeezesåÛå according to Ron Frezieres the councilåÛåªs vice president for research. It would come in three-packs the size of a credit card and almost as thin he said and like another grant winner called the Rapidom would have pull tabs to åÛåÏkeep you from being confused about which way to put it onåÛå Mr. Frezieres added.         At least two winners will work with polyurethane including Richard Chartoff a University of Oregon chemical engineer who foresees a åÛåÏone-size-fits-allåÛå design having shape memory to åÛåÏfit like an extra layer of skin conforming to the shape.åÛå He is also considering adding nanoparticles containing antiviral or antibacterial drugs and more prosaically offering different colors.         Stephen Ward a Gates Foundation program officer said that among the problems tackled were åÛåÏimproving lubrication internal friction external friction heat transfer.åÛå         Two or more grantees might be teamed to make one design he added. åÛåÏThereåÛåªs not one magic bulletåÛå he said. åÛåÏThe idea is making them easier for people to use in the moment in the dark whatever situation theyåÛåªre in.åÛå

Sure weåÛåªve always had some fiscal-crisis story to attend to åÛåÓ me reporting from Capitol Hill and you ensconced over at the White House. But letåÛåªs face it our interests are often more Drambuie than debt ceiling.         So as the holidays are upon us again I feel the need to reach out. I canåÛåªt quite decide what I dread more: the canned holiday music at the grocery store the abundance of red or all those cloying glasses of eggnog handed to us at office parties.         One of the most puzzling things about our drinking culture is that while we have restored revived and invented wonderful cocktails over the last decade our holiday drinks often remain woefully antiquated and disappointing. I donåÛåªt want eggnog unless it is exceptional. Phooey on the sauvignon blanc which we all should have retired at the beach last August and peace out please to the sherbet punch.         I donåÛåªt think it has to be this way. We can do better as a people for our holiday parties by embracing classic ingredients seasonal citrus fruits and holiday colors åÛåÓ but ditching the clichÌÄå©s. We may be amateurs but it doesnåÛåªt take much to throw together some great cocktails and even a great cocktail party.         Discuss.         TO: JENNIFER         FROM: HELENE         Hi Steinhauer         Yes for the holidays you really have to crank up the cocktails a notch. Nobody looks good in red but how about a red frozen vodka slushy? Red Roosters have become one of my specialty holiday drinks and people love them. First no one expects that youåÛåªre going to give them a frozen drink at  Christmas ; itåÛåªs usually all mulled wine and hot spiked cider. But the Red Rooster is so deliciously icy that it perks you right out of any holiday blues.         And you can make them days ahead. You mix vodka orange juice concentrate and cranberry-tangerine juice cocktail in a pitcher and freeze overnight (or whenever åÛåÓ I have left this stuff in my freezer for weeks; I usually freeze them in those tall water carafes you can buy at Target). When itåÛåªs time to serve just take the pitcher out and have a spoon ready to scrape the Red Roosters into martini glasses; they will never freeze solid thanks to the vodka.         (IåÛåªve also made them with white cranberry juice during a blizzard when everyone on my snowed-in street was climbing the walls and in dire need of cocktails. While it didnåÛåªt look like snow in a glass it looked a bit like freezing rain.)         TO: HELENE         FROM: JENNIFER         Easy prep: a good point. Holiday cocktails should be special but not too complicated. A bartender gets sad and cranky with too many ingredients to work with and no one wants to wait in line for complex fare.         One of my best memories of an office party is of you standing in as the makeshift bartender whipping up Campari-and-orange-juice cocktails which slowly but surely had the collective effect of making all of us like our colleagues quite a bit more than we actually do. How did you come up with that drink? And how easy is it to replicate on the fly?         When it comes to cocktails and work I generally invent them in response to a bad day. My personal favorite involves clementine oranges one of the most delightful contributions of the winter trees and gin snazzed up with some soda water. And when things get dark and cold I sometimes repair to the Tabard Inn here in Washington for its decent selections of Italian reds but I can be lured by its signature cocktail a blend of tequila sherry and Drambuie infused with the December aromas of thyme and citrus.         TO: JENNIFER         FROM: HELENE         You asked about the Campari orange cocktails that I served a couple of years ago right at deadline as I recall. Campari is so deeply underrated: I discovered it more than a decade ago. The woman sitting next to me on a plane ordered åÛåÏCampari on iceåÛå so trying to seem sophisticated I did too. It was so bitter; I hated it. But a few months later I was in Florence with some friends in the Piazza della Signoria and they ordered åÛåÏCampari orange.åÛå

Yet President ObamaåÛåªs biggest critics åÛåÓ in Congress the Arab world and Israel åÛåÓ argue that he has the strategy entirely backward. By changing the psychology around the world they argue the roughly $100 billion in remaining sanctions will gradually be whittled away. Wily middlemen Chinese eager for energy sources and Europeans looking for a way back to the old days when Iran was a major source of trade will see their chance to leap the barriers.         Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Geneva Saturday for his second visit in two weeks again heightening expectations that negotiators are close to agreement on a pact to suspend IranåÛåªs nuclear program for six months. But Mr. Kerry cautioned that his presence and that of the five other foreign ministers whose countries are negotiating with Iran might not be enough to guarantee that a deal could be reached.         Nevertheless with a deal seemingly in reach the focus is now shifting to the details and particularly what sanctions would be reversed in return for the freezing or dilution of IranåÛåªs uranium stockpile.         To some critics almost any relief is too much.         åÛåÏWe know who weåÛåªre dealing with and you know weåÛåªve watched this same type of activity occur in North Korea where you begin to alleviate sanctionsåÛå said Senator Bob Corker the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee invoking the example that many cite of a sanctions relaxation begun in the Bush administration that backfired.         åÛåÏThe concern is that whatever you do on an interim basis becomes the new normåÛå Mr. Corker told reporters as he left the White House the other day unconvinced by Mr. ObamaåÛåªs counterarguments.         The Senate narrowly avoided this week  a vote on new sanctions  against Iran that the White House feared would blow up its chances of getting a preliminary agreement in Geneva this weekend but Senator Harry Reid one of President ObamaåÛåªs greatest allies has made it clear a vote may well come soon after the Thanksgiving break.         At the heart of the dispute is a fundamental disagreement about how best to negotiate with a savvy skilled adversary one whose own decision-making processes have long baffled American intelligence agencies.         Mr. Obama and his aides have argued that unless they give President Hassan Rouhani and his Western-educated chief negotiator Mohammad Javad Zarif something to take home and advertise as a victory from the first round of negotiations there is little chance they will return to negotiate a second permanent deal.         åÛåÏZarif says he has at most six months to get a deal before the hard-liners rise againåÛå one of the Obama administrationåÛåªs strategists said recently. åÛåÏAnd we believe him.åÛå         The belief that Mr. ZarifåÛåªs warning was real set off a lengthy debate among the United States and its fellow major powers åÛåÓ Britain Germany France China and Russia åÛåÓ about how to give Iran a taste of relief without giving up too much. They settled on unfreezing a portion of the long-frozen assets that Iran has hungered to tap åÛåÓ roughly $3.6 billion in oil revenue parked in foreign banks. A senior administration official said the money would be doled out in still-to-be-determined increments over the six months of the agreement.         The other calculation is that if Tehran is allowed to sell some petrochemicals its second-largest export at roughly $11 billion last year and to build autos from kits brought into the country the Iranian economy will begin to create new jobs. The idea is to create a constituency for a bigger deal åÛåÓ one in which rolling back nuclear facilities dismantling centrifuges and allowing inspectors far greater access to suspect sites would be traded for a far greater lifting of sanctions.

There each year she helps train a few hundred new social workers many of whom will fan out into the city she has adored since moving here as a 19-year-old newlywed in 1965.         She knows how trying the work can be from a dozen years in the field most of them at  Bailey House  which serves the H.I.V. and AIDS communities. It was bleaker in the mid-1990s when she first worked there just before the advent of an effective drug cocktail. But Ms. Aldrich a former debutante from Boston who is now 68 came to love all aspects of the work åÛåÓ even when out on calls in cashmere sweaters and designer boots she was mistaken for an addict trying to score or a representative of Child Protective Services.         Over time counseling others helped her confront her own longstanding issues of identity and addiction. åÛåÏI was an alcoholicåÛå she said åÛåÏand I really felt that eventually I would kill myself.åÛå         Her personal narrative unwinds with startling candor as she gives a reporter a tour of her two-bedroom apartment. It is the first home made entirely for her out of three modest studio apartments in a building constructed in the 1920s to house dock- and railworkers. Her designer Thomas Cooper remains a close friend although as he deadpanned åÛåÏshe was determined to be in the driveråÛåªs seat on this one which I have to tell you made my life a living hell.åÛå         As Ms. Aldrich puts it åÛåÏGetting sober coming out the apartment really is a reflection of that.åÛå A recovering alcoholic she was married twice but is now openly out she said and beginning a new relationship. åÛåÏI wanted a lovely and connected but not stuffy place to be alone inåÛå she said åÛåÏbut also to share with my family and friends.åÛå         It is not lost on most of them how far this home is removed from the style in which she grew up in Hamilton Mass. The Beaux-Arts house she lived in there modestly known as the ÌâåÊ house at Rock Maple Farm  has its own web page.         But unless she is practically coerced Ms. Aldrich avoids discussing her family background. åÛåÏThe hardest thing for me is to talk about the world of privilege I grew up inåÛå she said.         The patriarch of the family was her great-grandfather Nelson W. Aldrich a United States senator from Rhode Island from 1881 to 1911 who is best known for laying the legislative groundwork for the Federal Reserve.         He is also known for entering public life as a man of somewhat modest means and becoming a much richer one while in office. A number of muckraking books have detailed how he did it but none as briskly as Ms. Aldrich: åÛåÏHe passed laws so the rich could stay richåÛå she said. And he was rewarded with trinkets large and small åÛåÓ invited for example to invest early on in public utility companies.         In a childhood full of nannies and boarding schools Ms. Aldrich found joy in art design and nesting. åÛåÏI was attracted to colors and cool new designers like MarimekkoåÛå she said. åÛåÏI ran away from antiques and instead was always tchotchke-ing things up.åÛå (Mr. Cooper has much to say about this tendency none of it kind.)         It was about a dozen years ago after finally coming into her own åÛåÓ earning a bacheloråÛåªs degree from N.Y.U. after her own children had gone to college and then a masteråÛåªs degree and establishing a career as a social worker åÛåÓ that she bought two combined studios here for about $500000. When an adjacent one came on the market in 2010 for $350000 she grabbed it. Peter Holtzman of Downtown Designworks Architecture joined the apartments creating a loft-like space with bedrooms at either end. (The renovation cost about $60000 not including furnishings.)         Perhaps it is not surprising that the things Ms. Aldrich most identifies with here are the workmanlike details: the planked floors the brick the band of metal between the hearth and the mantel that secures the fire escapes. In a way this apartment is a symbol of her evolving life and she seems genuinely awed by the richly textured quality of what she has created.         åÛåÏEverything comes late for me.åÛå        
1.0,5.08,5.822848837,6.23,1154.139,0.401935484,1691.5179999999998,67.0,1259.156,1532.0,1542.604,24.0,American students are bored by math science and engineering. They buy smartphones and tablets by the millions but donåÛåªt pursue the skills necessary to build them. Engineers and physicists are often portrayed as clueless geeks on television and despite the high pay and the importance of such jobs to the countryåÛåªs future the vast majority of high school graduates donåÛåªt want to go after them.          Nearly 90 percent of high school graduates  say theyåÛåªre not interested in a career or a college major involving science technology engineering or math known collectively as STEM according to a survey of more than a million students who take the ACT test. The number of students who want to pursue engineering or computer science jobs  is actually falling  precipitously at just the moment when the need for those workers is soaring. (Within five years there will be 2.4 million STEM job openings.)         One of the biggest reasons for that lack of interest is that students have been turned off to the subjects as they move from kindergarten to high school. Many are being taught by teachers who have no particular expertise in the subjects. They are following outdated curriculums and textbooks. They become convinced theyåÛåªre  åÛåÏno good at mathåÛå  that math and science are only for nerds and fall behind.         ThatåÛåªs because the American system of teaching these subjects is broken. For all the reform campaigns over the years most schools continue to teach math and science in an off-putting way that appeals only to the most fervent students. The mathematical sequence has changed little since the Sputnik era: arithmetic pre-algebra algebra geometry trigonometry and for only 17 percent of students calculus. Science is generally limited to the familiar trinity of biology chemistry physics and occasionally earth science.         These pathways  as one report  from the National Academy of Education put it assume that high school students will continue to study science and math in college. But  fewer than 13 percent  do usually the most well-prepared and persistent students who often come from families where encouragement and enrichment are fundamental. The system is alienating and is leaving behind millions of other students almost all of whom could benefit from real-world problem solving rather than traditional drills.         Only 11 percent of the jobs in the STEM fields require high-level math according to Anthony Carnevale director of  the Center on Education and the Workforce  at Georgetown University. But the rest still require skills in critical thinking that most high school students arenåÛåªt getting in the long march to calculus.         Finding ways to make math and science exciting for students who are in the middle of the pack could have a profound effect on their futures providing them with the skills that will help them get technical jobs in the fields of food science computer networking or medicine. It would entice many students who are insecure in their own abilities into advanced careers. But it is going to require a fundamentally different approach to teaching these subjects from childhood through high school. Here are a few of the many possible ideas to begin that change.         American students need vastly improved skills in math and science åÛåÓ they ranked 30th among students in 65 nations in math åÛåÓ but they do not all have to be trained to be mathematicians or scientists. While all students need a strong grasp of the fundamentals of critical thinking and problem solving including algebra and geometry they should be offered a greater choice between applied skills and the more typical abstract courses.         This is not an endorsement of tracking the old practice of shunting some students into vocational classes while others are prepped for college. Every graduate should be ready for college (whether for a two- or four-year degree) but should also be exposed to the variety of skills that will be demanded as the country continues its shift to a post-industrial economy.  As a study by the Georgetown center notes  very few high schools offer career or technical education; any deviation from a classical math education is viewed with suspicion.         Research has shown that the right mix of career and technical education can  reduce dropout rates  and the courses offered donåÛåªt have to be from the old åÛåÏindustrial artsåÛå ghettos. They should be taught at a challenging level and make students aware of careers that are now being ignored. Take engineering for example a field that pays well and needs ever more workers. Most high school students  say they have no interest in the subject . ThatåÛåªs largely because few of them ever encounter it:  Only 3 percent of graduates  have taken an engineering course. Only 19 percent of students  have taken a computer science course  mostly at the advanced placement level.         The  Common Core math standards  now being adopted by most states are an important effort to raise learning standards particularly in primary and middle school when many students begin to fall behind. They encourage the use of technology and applied thinking moving students away from rote memorization. At the high school level they would introduce all students to useful concepts like  real-world modeling . But the standards also assume that all high school students should pursue a high-level math track studying quadratic equations transformational geometry and logarithms. The standards need more flexibility to ensure that they do not stand in the way of nontraditional but effective ways to learn including career-oriented study.         Only 18 percent of American adults can calculate  how much a carpet will cost  if they know the size of the room and the per square yard price of the carpet according to a federal survey. One in five American adults lack the basic math skills expected of eighth graders making them unfit for many newly created jobs. In many cases thatåÛåªs because they werenåÛåªt exposed to numbers at an early age.          A new study by researchers at the University of Missouri  showed that the most important factor that predicted math success in middle school and upward was an understanding of what numbers are before entering the first grade. Having åÛåÏnumber system knowledgeåÛå in kindergarten or earlier åÛåÓ grasping that a numeral represents a quantity and understanding the relationships among numbers åÛåÓ was a more important factor in math success by seventh grade than intelligence race or income.         Children of all backgrounds can build a good foundation in math with early exposure to numbers which should be required in all preschool classes. But  less than half of 4-year-olds  are enrolled in full-day pre-K programs and only 70 percent of kindergartners go all day. Although preschool enrollment has increased in recent years it is still not a high priority in many states and cities as shown by the cold reception to expansion proposals by President Obama and Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio of New York.         The most effective teachers have broad knowledge of their subjects. Too many lack that preparation.  More than half of the 6.7 million students  studying physical sciences åÛåÓ chemistry physics and earth science åÛåÓ are learning from teachers who did not major in those subjects. Only 64 percent of those teachers are certified. The number is better for math teachers as 78 percent are certified but that still leaves three million math students being taught by uncertified teachers. The problem is significantly worse in low-income communities and in middle schools.         Some districts give additional instruction to science and math teachers or team new teachers with more experienced colleagues. But the most important effort is the national campaign to add 100000 STEM teachers by 2021.  The Carnegie Corporation has led a coalition  of businesses universities and other institutions to make it happen at the ground level. The American Museum of Natural History for example has pledged to prepare 130 certified science teachers by 2015. The University of Chicago will train 500 new teachers for ChicagoåÛåªs public schools over five years. The campaign now has commitments for more than 37000 new teachers but it still has far to go.         A growing number of schools are helping students embrace STEM courses by linking them to potential employers and careers taking math and science out of textbooks and into their lives. The high school in Brooklyn known as  P-Tech  which President Obama recently visited is a collaboration of the New York City public school system and the City University of New York with IBM. It  prepares students for jobs  like manufacturing technician and software specialist. Students work with IBM mentors and are encouraged to earn both a diploma and an associate degree after a combined six years in high school and college.  Ten more such schools are planned around the state  and last month President Obama announced  a promising new grant program  to encourage dozens more high schools to offer job-oriented STEM education.         In Seattle  Raisbeck Aviation High School  is working with Boeing and other aerospace firms to mentor students in engineering and robotics. Many schools are teaming with software companies to teach programming including  two schools that are very popular in New York City . Though many of these efforts remain untested they center around a practical and achievable goal: getting students excited about science and mathematics the first step to improving their performance and helping them discover a career.

ThatåÛåªs the 21st Century Fox family which owns the studio that created åÛåÏThe SimpsonsåÛå (20th Century Fox Television) the network that broadcasts it (Fox) and now the cable network (FXX) that has acquired both cable and streaming rights to the more than 550 episodes.         Terms of the agreement were not disclosed but a representative of one of the other companies that pursued the package said that the bidding was highly competitive and estimated that the per-episode figure reached $1.5 million to $1.6 million. That would put the value of the deal at close to $900 million.         The 24 seasons of shows that have been completed will begin airing in August 2014. The 25th season currently in production will be available the month after.         The rights include not only the exclusive exposure on FXX which is the new comedy offshoot of the FX Network but also video-on-demand and streaming rights. By locking up these platforms FXX can control the way it uses them while keeping the shows away from competitors. That means for the foreseeable future the episodes are likely to contain some form of advertising and not find their way onto increasingly popular ad-free subscription services like Netflix or Amazon.         The shows will be streamed online by FXNOW a mobile viewing app that FX Networks plans to introduce soon.         Other companies that most likely would have been interested in the Simpsons package include Turner Broadcasting on behalf of two of its cable networks: TBS which mainly offers repeats of hit network comedies and Adult Swim which has carved out an identity substantially on reruns of other Fox animated comedies like åÛåÏFamily GuyåÛå and åÛåÏAmerican Dad.åÛå Both Viacom and NBC Universal were also widely mentioned as potential bidders.         When Gary Newman the chief executive of 20th Century Fox Television announced the prospective cable sale in September he called the show åÛåÏthe greatest television asset of all timeåÛå emphasizing that with 530 episodes completed (and at least one more season of 24 original shows already scheduled) åÛåÏThe SimpsonsåÛå could run as a nightly entry on a cable network for more than a year and never have to repeat an episode.         Of course åÛåÏSimpsonsåÛå episodes have not been locked away in a closet like prized baseball cards. For two decades repeats of åÛåÏThe SimpsonsåÛå have been widely seen on local broadcast television stations. Every other sitcom hit of recent vintage from åÛåÏSeinfeldåÛå to åÛåÏThe Big Bang TheoryåÛå has been made available in multiple sales to broadcasters and cable networks alike. Studios rarely leave such opportunities on the table.         But åÛåÏThe SimpsonsåÛå was locked into an unusual åÛåÓ and now vintage åÛåÓ deal. The show was first sold into syndication in 1993. While an enormous hit for Fox åÛåÏThe SimpsonsåÛå always stood out because it was animated. When Fox tried to place live-action comedies adjacent to it they never really worked.         So the stations paying hefty rights fees insisted on maintaining exclusivity åÛåÓ meaning no sale to a cable network for as long as they were buying new seasons of reruns. åÛåÏThe SimpsonsåÛå åÛåÓ with a cast that never visibly aged åÛåÓ kept making new episodes on Fox and the syndication contracts kept going.         Until now. The studio has finally worked a way to open the cable window one that has long been estimated to be worth a fortune to a show that already is one of the greatest moneymakers in entertainment history considering the value that has been reaped from merchandising a theme park attraction and a theatrical movie.         For the fledgling FXX network the deal is clearly intended to be a foundation stone. FX known mainly for well-regarded dramas like åÛåÏThe ShieldåÛå åÛåÏNip/TuckåÛå åÛåÏJustifiedåÛå and åÛåÏSons of AnarchyåÛå spun off its comedy lineup (åÛåÏLouieåÛå åÛåÏItåÛåªs Always Sunny in PhiladelphiaåÛå) in the all-comedy network starting last September.         The results so far have been lackluster. Ratings for shows that have moved from FX to FXX have been nothing close to what they were in the past. In the most prominent example the late-night talk show åÛåÏTotally Biased With W. Kamau BellåÛå had more than 300000 viewers on FX but fell to fewer than 50000 on FXX and was canceled this week.         Now FX will have a core of comedy programming with the longest track record in television history.         Paying the hefty price has less sting because the money essentially moves from one corporate pocket to another åÛåÓ minus the many millions that will be paid to the profit participants in the show which include among many others Matt Groening who created the original comic characters and James Brooks the famed television and movie creator who brought the show to Fox 25 years ago.

But under the new law the Affordable Care Act Mr. HorriganåÛåªs coverage by a state high-risk insurance program was eliminated then replaced by a more expensive plan. His wifeåÛåªs individual plan was canceled for being substandard then suddenly renewed åÛåÓ also at a higher price.         So while Mr. Horrigan 59 believes the law will improve health care in the long run its short-term effect has been chaotic and trying for him and his wife Kay. åÛåÏItåÛåªs more stressful than it needed to beåÛå he said.         For a measure of the tumult that has accompanied the arrival of the federal health care overhaul there may be no better place to look than in the politically mixed state of North Carolina where both the anxiety and the promise of revamping the health insurance system has left hundreds of thousands of people struggling to sort out their options.         Many will end up with better coverage than they had and may get help paying for it. Others will see their costs rise and are wondering if the change is worth it. And some like the Horrigans may find themselves falling into both camps.         The agitation has been building for months. This fall insurers notified about 260000 North Carolinians that their individual health plans no longer complied with the lawåÛåªs more stringent requirements and many learned that the plans they were being offered as replacements would cost hundreds of dollars more per month. Then after Mr. Obama  said on Nov. 14 that insurers would be allowed to renew their plans for one year  Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina announced that 230000 of its customers in the state could keep their own plans åÛåÓ but at prices that rose 16 percent to 24 percent.         Kathleen LaFleur a broker who works with people who have individual plans at  Employee Benefit Advisors  an insurance agency here said many of the callers to her office had two things in common: confusion and anger. åÛåÏThey are confused before they callåÛå she said. åÛåÏAfter they call theyåÛåªre not confused anymore. TheyåÛåªre angry.åÛå         Adding to the confusion is the fact that many consumers have been unable to fully evaluate their options because the federal health care website which serves residents of North Carolina and 33 other states did not work very well until recently. Those who qualify for subsidies must sign up through the federal marketplace. Consumers have until Dec. 23 to sign up for coverage beginning in January.         åÛåÏIt has obviously been extremely frustrating for individual policyholders who have received cancellation notices at a time when thereåÛåªs such a short window for them to decide what their coverage options will beåÛå said Wayne Goodwin North CarolinaåÛåªs insurance commissioner an elected Democrat.         Still for some the new law is working well. Rachel Bryant a small-business owner who lives just outside Winston-Salem felt unlucky when she received a notice from Blue Cross saying that her plan was being canceled and that the replacement would raise her monthly bill to $675 from $408.         But when Ms. Bryant a single mother of two young children who earns about $30000 through her legal services business finally succeeded after many tries to log onto the online marketplace  HealthCare.gov  she learned she was eligible for subsidies that would bring down her premiums to just $150 a month.         åÛåÏIåÛåªm extremely happyåÛå said Ms. Bryant 36. åÛåÏIåÛåªm not going to go bankrupt because of medical bills. IåÛåªm looking forward to it and IåÛåªll put up with the frustration and the bother.åÛå         About half of those buying individual insurance in the existing market will be eligible for a subsidy  according to a national study  by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That does not include an additional one million people who buy individual insurance now but under the provisions of the health law will be eligible for Medicaid beginning in 2014 according to the study.         For others like the Horrigans the transition is proving uncomfortable.         Ms. Horrigan 61 is a former psychiatric social worker; Mr. Horrigan is a former corporate human resources expert who started a consulting business in Charlotte after atrial fibrillation required two heart surgeries. Because of his heart problem he was denied insurance and found coverage through North CarolinaåÛåªs high-risk insurance pool.         So they understood Mr. Horrigan said why the Affordable Care Act was necessary. The new law was designed to fix flaws in the old market in which people with existing medical conditions like Mr. Horrigan could find themselves uninsurable and without limits on out-of-pocket costs åÛåÓ people for whom serious illness often meant financial ruin. Under the new law such people cannot be turned away or be charged more by insurers and subsidies are available to those whose incomes fall below a certain level.         åÛåÏI was a poster child for why folks should have this opportunityåÛå Mr. Horrigan said.        
1.0,4.78,5.6284920629999995,8.18,1410.819,0.332439678,1215.478,41.0,1363.328,743.0,1329.5910000000001,19.0,A FEW years ago one of my graduate students showed me a Google Earth image that changed my view of the world. On a photo showing all of South America I could clearly see a single soybean farm in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. My first thought was that a farm that big sitting on the edge of the Amazon must be an environmental disaster. But when it comes to agricultural sustainability all is not what it seems.         Despite what you might hear at your local farmersåÛåª market or Whole Foods not all big farms are bad. Nor are all small organic farms sustainable. They may produce high-quality food but if they donåÛåªt produce a lot of calories per acre they are doing little to help increase the global food supply. How we increase this supply over the next few decades will determine agricultureåÛåªs sustainability. ItåÛåªs worth exploring why this is so because sustainable food production is a fundamental human need. Getting it right will require us to carefully assess the consequences of where and how we farm.         Already the worldåÛåªs farms take up an area the size of South America. By 2050 a global population of nearly 10 billion people will require roughly 70 percent more food. We have two options: Either we need to get more food out of the land we already farm or we need to farm more land.         Nowhere are farmers pursuing the first option faster than in Mato Grosso. Last January I decided to see the consequences for myself. After a long flight from Boston I rode the night bus nearly 500 miles of rutted roads to reach the frontier town of Canarana. Only about 25000 people live here but the main street has several stores selling million-dollar tractors. Waiting for my ride to the farm I met a man from Silicon Valley who commutes every month to sell heavy equipment. He told me åÛåÏThis is where the money is.åÛå         How can we determine if these farms are sustainable? Admittedly itåÛåªs unnerving to stand in an endless sea of soybeans where there was once rain forest. Exotic animals like tapirs jaguars and rheas wander through the monocrop desert and macaws compete for airspace with crop dusters. But sustainability has little to do with appearances. Sustainability depends on whether a farm can continue to produce food over the long term without irreparably damaging the environment or causing other land to be cleared in the quest for increased food production.         For the past five years my students colleagues and I have been trying to understand the sustainability of these giant soy farms. Although I typically work on tropical forests and the soils that sustain them the fate of the forests I love is intimately intertwined with the way people use them. When colleagues suggested that I come to Mato Grosso to see this bustling agricultural frontier I jumped at the chance.         We focused first on fertilizer. Fertilizer helps grow more food on a given plot of land but overuse can have serious environmental consequences. Largely these depend on how efficiently farms use nitrogen and phosphorus. These two elements which limit how much crops can grow are the main components of fertilizer. Crops donåÛåªt absorb all the fertilizer farmers apply and whatåÛåªs left behind often ends up in waterways where it fuels algae growth. Fifty years of heavy fertilizer use in the breadbaskets of the United States and Europe has left lakes rivers and coasts with algae-choked åÛåÏdead zones.åÛå         We expected the story to be similar in Mato Grosso. But to our surprise weåÛåªve found that streams draining the farms there have no more nitrogen or phosphorus than those in adjacent forests. The deep tropical soils are highly efficient filters removing nutrients before they reach the water. In the American Midwest scientists have long been searching for ways to clean up farm runoff. In Mato Grosso the soils do the work.         But these same soils present a sustainability concern on a different front. After millions of years of heavy rainfall Mato GrossoåÛåªs soils have lost nearly all their phosphorus. The soils efficiently remove phosphorus before it reaches the streams but also bind phosphorus added as fertilizer leaving less for the crops. As a result farms here require twice as much phosphorus fertilizer as their counterparts in more temperate regions where the soils are younger and more fertile. And phosphate ore the source of phosphorus fertilizer is a finite resource.

Fall leaves åÛåÓ so pretty on the trees such a nuisance when they hit the ground åÛåÓ have long been a thing to be discarded. But now some suburban towns are asking residents to do something radical: Leave the leaves alone.         In the past few years lawn signs have sprouted in this Hudson River village and across Westchester County proclaiming the benefits of mulching the leaves in place rather than raking them up and taking them away. The technique involves mowing the leaves with special mulching blades which shred them into tiny bits. That allows them to quickly decompose and naturally feed lawns and shrubs.         Officials are encouraging the practice for its cost savings: Westchester spends $3.5 million a year on private contractors who haul away leaves in tractor-trailers and bring them to commercial composting sites in places like Orange County N.Y. and Connecticut. At the same time environmental groups and horticulturalists are praising the practiceåÛåªs sustainability devising slogans like åÛåÏLeave Leaves AloneåÛå and  åÛåÏLove åÛåªEm and Leave åÛåªEm.åÛå   Karen Engelmann a novelist in Dobbs Ferry used to rake up the leaves on her half-acre property which is laced with old oak trees. She once had 120 bags of leaves lined up at her curb to be taken away by the village. åÛåÏI wondered åÛå÷Where do these go?åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå she recalled. åÛåÏI thought it was odd that there wasnåÛåªt an alternative that there wasnåÛåªt someone saying you might want to think about how the planet functions.åÛå         It turned out that her landscaper Tim Downey had started experimenting with the new technique. On an unseasonably warm afternoon last week he navigated his mulching mower over a thick pile of leaves producing a fine layer of confetti. Mr. Downey said the mulched leaves improve the soilåÛåªs water retention and provide critical nutrients reducing the need for fertilizer in the spring.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs utterly insane to be driving tractor-trailers 90 miles awayåÛå said Mr. Downey owner of Aesthetic Landscape Care in Hastings-on-Hudson. åÛåÏMy feeling is that if IåÛåªm taking away your leaves IåÛåªm stealing from your property.åÛå         Indeed commercial firms use fall leaves as a raw material to produce mulch and compost for sale to nurseries. But towns and counties pay to get rid of them. In Westchester for instance the county pays a private hauler about $40 for every ton of leaves that it takes away. Municipalities that provide leaf pickup service pay the county $15 a ton. So some county residents ultimately foot the bill through both municipal and county taxes.         County officials say mulching leaves in place not only improves soil quality but also has other environmental and safety benefits for communities. Piles of leaves left at the curb can clog storm drains; the nitrogen and phosphorous leaching from decomposing leaves heaped by the street can also more easily enter the drains and harm local rivers. Additionally leaf piles constrict already narrow streets and can conceal children.         Westchester County appears to be in the vanguard on leaf mulching but there are nascent steps in New Jersey and Connecticut to reduce leaf collections. For the first time this fall the city of Englewood N.J. which estimates that between overtime equipment maintenance and fees it spends $200000 a year on leaf removal is pushing the idea in emails and a newsletter. åÛåÏLeaves clog storm drains theyåÛåªre slippery and they can catch on fire when cars park on top of themåÛå said Kevin Lake a member of the cityåÛåªs Environmental Commission.         Public service announcements and mulching workshops in Westchester have nudged homeowners to buy mulching attachments for their mowers and impelled landscapers to offer the service. But it is not always an easy sell.         For those who do it themselves the mulching attachments can be cumbersome. And then there is the aesthetic factor. åÛåÏPeople want everything removed from their lawn and landscapers just want to keep their customers happyåÛå said Marianne Petronella director of resource management for Westchester CountyåÛåªs Environmental Facilities Department. åÛåÏI know some residents would never do mulching in place. They want to keep up with the Joneses.åÛå         Stephen J. Edwards the director of public works in Westport Conn. agreed. åÛåÏUnfortunately people are just very conscious of the appearance of the lawn and they want to see it spotless all the timeåÛå he said adding that the town spent $85000 to take residentsåÛåª leaves away. Still he said Westport encourages leaf composting especially for some of the one- to two-acre properties in the northern part of town. åÛåÏResidents can blow the leaves into big piles and Mother Nature does the workåÛå he said.         Two years ago Ms. Petronella enlisted a landscaper who mulches leaves and tried it on her own property in Scarsdale which she described as a åÛåÏpostage stamp.åÛå There was leafy residue for a few days after the mowers came through but it quickly disappeared. åÛåÏMy land is just as attractive as any of my neighborsåÛåª and I didnåÛåªt turn on my sprinklers once the past two summers not onceåÛå Ms. Petronella said.         The holdouts are not convinced. In Hastings-on-Hudson Chloe Sikirica a 50-year-old artist was blowing leaves off her yard. With twin boys she worries about the leaf confetti. åÛåÏIf you shred them and leave them then the kids will track the mulch into the houseåÛå she said.         Her one nod to sustainable yard care: leaving leaves around her trees and hedges to provide a natural mulch.         In northern Westchester Fiona Mitchell of Bedford is a mulching convert. A member of the board of her local library Ms. Mitchell got the idea a few years ago when the library was facing budget cuts. åÛåÏI said åÛå÷Hang on weåÛåªre spending all this money on leavesåÛåªÌâåÊåÛå she remembered.         Bedford estimates that 10 workers and 10 vehicles are needed over six weeks to pick up leaf bags and suck up piles of leaves from curbs; unlike other towns it composts them on site so it does not pay for hauling.         Now Ms. Mitchell does her own leaves switching the blades on her mower come fall. She said the leaves provide so much benefit to her soil that this fall she åÛåÏborrowedåÛå some from her neighbor to mulch. And she has become something of a proselytizer for the practice among her neighbors and those in other towns.         åÛåÏIåÛåªm afraid IåÛåªm becoming a bit of a mulching policeåÛå she said. åÛåÏMy friends call out åÛå÷IåÛåªm mulching IåÛåªm mulchingåÛåª when I walk by their houses.åÛå

It took weeks to put the paperwork together given that her papers and belongings were scattered across the country åÛåÓ there was a broken-down car and boxes of paperwork in Virginia Beach clothes in Colorado and personal possessions at a friendåÛåªs house in Somerville Mass. She managed to estimate her income åÛåÓ maybe $5000 last year but maybe half that this year åÛåÓ from odd jobs. Soon she would officially have nothing.         It has been a painful slide. A five-year spell of unemployment has slowly scrubbed away nearly every vestige of Ms. Barrington-WardåÛåªs middle-class life. She is a 53-year-old college graduate who worked steadily for three decades. She is now broke and homeless.         Ms. Barrington-Ward describes it as åÛåÏmy journey through hell.åÛå She was laid off from an administrative position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2008; she had earned about $50000 that year. With the recession spurring employers to dump hundreds of thousands of workers a month and the unemployment rate climbing to the double digits she found that no matter the number of rÌÄå©sumÌÄå©s she sent out åÛåÓ she stopped counting in the thousands åÛåÓ she could not find work.         åÛåÏIåÛåªve been turned down from McDonaldåÛåªs because I was told I was too articulateåÛå she says. åÛåÏI got denied a job scrubbing toilets because I didnåÛåªt speak Spanish and turned away from a laundromat because I was åÛå÷too pretty.åÛåª IåÛåªve also been told point-blank to my face åÛå÷We donåÛåªt hire the unemployed.åÛåª And the two times I got real interest from a prospective employer the credit check ended it immediately.åÛå         For Ms. Barrington-Ward joblessness itself has become a trap an impediment to finding a job. Economists see it the same way concerned that joblessness lasting more than six months is a major factor preventing people from getting rehired with potentially grave consequences for tens of millions of Americans.         The long-term jobless after all tend to be in poorer health and to have higher rates of suicide and strained  family relations . Even the children of the long-term unemployed see lower earnings down the road.         The consequences are grave for the country too: lost production increased social spending decreased tax revenue and slower growth. Policy makers and academics are now asking whether an improving economy might absorb those workers in time to prevent long-term economic damage.         åÛåÏI donåÛåªt think we know the answeråÛå said  Jesse Rothstein  an economist at the University of California Berkeley. åÛåÏBut right now I think everybodyåÛåªs worst fears are coming true as far as we can tell.åÛå         Soon after we first talked in October Ms. Barrington-Ward left her sisteråÛåªs house in Ohio where she had crashed for six weeks and went back to Boston and filed her bankruptcy paperwork. She contacted a headhunter. åÛåÏIåÛåªve got to get a jobåÛå she said. åÛåÏI just have to.åÛå She had two job interviews lined up and her fingers crossed.         Long-term joblessness åÛåÓ the kind that Ms. Barrington-Ward and about four million others are experiencing åÛåÓ is now one of the defining realities of the American work force.         The unemployment rate has fallen to  7.3 percent  down from 10 percent four years ago. Private businesses have added about 7.6 million positions over the same period. But while recent numbers show that there are about as many people unemployed for short periods as in 2007 åÛåÓ before the crisis hit åÛåÓ they also show that long-term joblessness is up 213 percent.         In part thatåÛåªs because people donåÛåªt return to work in an orderly first-fired first-hired fashion. In any given month a newly jobless worker has about a 20 to 30 percent chance of finding a new job. By the time he or she has been out of work for six months though the chance drops to one in 10  according to research  by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.         Facing those kinds of odds some of the long-term jobless have simply given up and dropped out of the labor force. So while official figures show that the number of long-term jobless has fallen steeply from its recessionary high of 6.7 million many researchers fear that this number could mean as much bad news as good. Workers over 50 may be biding their time until they can start receiving  Social Security . Younger workers may be going to school to avoid a tough job market. Others may be going on disability helping to explain that programåÛåªs surging rolls.         Stan Hampton 59 a veteran of the Iraq war is now earning his associate degree. But he has not had a job since returning from active duty in 2007 and is now living in an apartment complex for veterans near Las Vegas.         åÛåÏIåÛåªm just trying to hang on until my retirement kicks inåÛå he said though he stressed that he would still look for a job. åÛåÏI have not been in jail or prison nor am I an alcoholic drug addict or gambling addict. I am simply old unemployed and out of money.åÛå

And often it‰Ûªs fatal. In fact it is the most dangerous thing most people will do. Until very recently health care experts believed that preventable hospital error caused some 98000 deaths a year in the United States ‰ÛÓ a figure based on 1984 data. But a new  report  from the Journal of Patient Safety using updated data holds such error responsible for many more deaths ‰ÛÓ probably around some 440000 per year. That‰Ûªs one-sixth of all deaths nationally making preventable hospital error the third leading cause of death in the United States. And 10 to 20 times that many people suffer nonlethal but serious harm as a result of hospital mistakes. Most of us decide which hospital to go to (that is when we get to decide) with zero data about hospital safety. Information however is gradually reaching the public and it can do more than just help us choose wisely. When patients can judge hospitals on their safety records hospitals will become safer. Just as publishing health care prices will drive them down publishing safety information will drive hospital safety up.

Mr. Jarrett plays every instrument himself leaning on electric guitar and drums and hardly touching the piano. The multitracked result often feels like a sincere but hermetic response to the Grateful Dead which apparently isnåÛåªt too far off the mark.         åÛåÏI never took drugs of any kind but I knew we were trying to experience truth without dogmaåÛå Mr. Jarrett writes in the CD booklet åÛåÏand I was a participant in Haight-Ashbury during the golden days of hippiedom.åÛå He recalls taking a saxophone to Golden Gate Park for daylong sessions with a hodgepodge of fellow seekers: åÛåÏSome of the players were not so good but it didnåÛåªt really matter; it was the åÛå÷intentåÛåª that counted. People walked by and listened or not. It was a rare kind of freedom.åÛå The music on åÛåÏNo EndåÛå he implies flowed from that same place.         That Mr. Jarrett was feeling nostalgic about the Age of Aquarius in the colder era of Iran-contra is unremarkable even a generational clichÌÄå©. That he set out to recreate the euphoria of a fundamentally social experience in solitude is more telling. ItåÛåªs hard to think of a major jazz figure who has been as cloistered as Mr. Jarrett while remaining a vital force. And itåÛåªs hard to know the precise legacy of that isolationism which can seem like the pilot light of a creative furnace or the match setting a house if not a bridge aflame.         Mr. Jarrett 68 became a kind of existential hero to many of his admirers with the 1975 solo album åÛåÏThe KÌÄå¦ln ConcertåÛå a foundational text for both his career and for ECM the German label that soon became his exclusive outlet. His concert-length piano improvisations are still  a source of kaleidoscopic wonder  in new or vintage form; for a particularly fine example consult åÛåÏConcerts: Bregenz/MÌÄå_nchenåÛå recorded in 1981 and finally released in full as a three-CD set this week.         At the same time Mr. Jarrett has for the past 30 years maintained a trio with the bassist Gary Peacock and the drummer Jack DeJohnette. This group which will appear at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday night is rightly celebrated for the quality of its interplay which brings a conversational feeling to the mainstream language of the jazz piano trio.         ThatåÛåªs conversational as in not a soliloquy; Mr. Jarrett is unmistakably the leader but at its best his trio dwells in a spirit of collectivity and empathy. Hear how the musicians work together through åÛåÏSolaråÛå and åÛåÏI Thought About YouåÛå the jazz standards that bookend  åÛåÏSomewhereåÛå  an exceptional album released this spring. ThereåÛåªs never a moment when Mr. DeJohnette or Mr. Peacock settles for stock pattern work or fails to engage deeply with Mr. Jarrett who responds in kind.         Still 30 years is a long time for any band especially when you consider that Mr. Jarrett who will be honored as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master on Jan. 13 has made music with only a few other people in all those years. Jazz musicians tend to get around as a matter of course; it would be a daunting task to compile a list of all the people that Mr. JarrettåÛåªs peers Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock have worked with over the same three decades. (Mr. Corea has shown that he can cheerfully go through dozens of collaborators  in a single month  given a good excuse.)         Mr. Jarrett has held to a nearly unwavering regimen of solo and trio recordings with rare exceptions like åÛåÏSix Sonatas for Violin and PianoåÛå another of this yearåÛåªs releases featuring the violinist Michelle Makarski in a pristine Bach recital; and åÛåÏJasmineåÛå a 2010 ballads album with the bassist Charlie Haden a confrere from the 1970s. Mr. Jarrett tends to shrug off questions about his short list of collaborators as he did in  a recent interview with the pianist Ethan Iverson  in DownBeat magazine.         åÛåÏAt this point anything else I would do would be an eventåÛå he told Mr. Iverson explaining the trioåÛåªs constancy. åÛåÏAnd what if it was horrible and lasted only a very short time? IåÛåªd happily go out of my career knowing I had never made that kind of mistake.åÛå         Which brings us back to åÛåÏNo EndåÛå which like åÛåÏJasmineåÛå åÛåÓ and the most intimate of Mr. JarrettåÛåªs solo piano albums åÛåÏThe Melody at Night With YouåÛå from 1999 åÛåÓ was recorded on his property in a bucolic corner of northwest New Jersey within the small stand-alone building he long ago christened Cavelight Studio. (That name with its suggestion of an illuminated subconscious isnåÛåªt random; Mr. Jarrett calls his publishing company Cavelight Music.)         åÛåÏNo EndåÛå amounts to an hour and a half of aimless but layered hippie mysticism; at times Mr. Jarrett seems intent on embodying the memory of those not-so-good players in Golden Gate Park. The guitar work occasionally evokes Jerry Garcia but itåÛåªs not particularly fluent not even harmonically. (The bass playing on a Fender electric is another story; Mr. Jarrett knows his way around a left-hand piano vamp and he manages to translate that rubbery energy to another medium.) It might have been a fun experiment to release the album on an American indie label like Woodsist where its shambolic properties could find a context other than Mr. JarrettåÛåªs heavily scrutinized solo career. As it stands åÛåÏNo EndåÛå is easy fodder for those who would accuse Mr. Jarrett of vanity or self-absorption; itåÛåªs partly dedicated åÛåÏto my friends and to my enemies.åÛå         ThatåÛåªs a stronger word even than åÛåÏhatersåÛå but then Mr. Jarrett is a polarizing figure  notoriously volatile and imperious  with his audiences. (Cameras and coughing are his most reliable triggers.) The paradox in Mr. JarrettåÛåªs career is that recordings made in controlled seclusion represent a small percentage of his work. He often speaks of an implicit compact with his listeners who åÛåÓ in an ideal situation anyway åÛåÓ become partners in a creative act that couldnåÛåªt otherwise exist.         He has a point there as anyone who has sat through one of his really good nights can attest. But for someone who still idealizes the nontransactional freedom of those park jam sessions itåÛåªs a little rich to impose behavioral standards on every crowd. The unanswerable question is whether a less guarded aesthetic reality one with more variability and sunlight and skirmish might have made any difference.

A Malaysian woman 69; an Irishwoman 57; and a British woman 30 were freed from the house in the Lambeth district in South London in October after one of the women contacted a charity that helps victims of forced marriage the police said at a news conference. They said the youngest woman had apparently been held captive her entire life.         The two suspects an unidentified man and a woman both 67 were arrested Thursday morning and were being held in a South London police station pending charges. The British police generally do not identify suspects until they have been charged. The police would not say whether the couple owned the home and they declined to elaborate on other details of the womenåÛåªs ordeal or the arrests.         Although the captive women had enjoyed some åÛåÏcontrolled freedomåÛå the police said they had been forced to perform domestic tasks. Kevin Hyland a detective inspector in the Metropolitan PoliceåÛåªs Human Trafficking Unit said most of their days were probably spent indoors though it remained unclear under what conditions and whether they had been held in more than one house. They did not appear to be related the police said.         åÛåÏWe have had some other cases we have dealt with previously where we know that people have been held for periods of up to 10 years but never anything on this scale beforeåÛå Detective Hyland said.         At least one of the women may have been forcibly married to the man in the house according to an official close to the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. Although Detective Hyland said that there was no evidence that the women had suffered sexual abuse this official said the police suspected otherwise.         åÛåÏThe woman appears to have been through some kind of religious marriage ceremony with the male member of the couple that kept themåÛå he said. All three appeared to have been used as unpaid domestic helpers but åÛåÏmanipulatedåÛå into believing that staying was in their best interest he said. The oldest one the Malaysian had been with the couple the longest 30 years he said.         The story dominated the evening news on the main broadcasters and led the home pages of all major newspapers as Britons tried to grasp the idea that three adult women might have been kept as domestic slaves in their capital. A statement from the Home Office emphasized that the police still needed to get to the bottom of the matter but also expressed åÛåÏdetermination to tackle the scourge of modern slavery.åÛå         After a television documentary on forced marriages was broadcast in October the Irish woman contacted  Freedom Charity  which specializes in helping victims of such marriages and whose work was featured in the program according to the charityåÛåªs founder Aneeta Prem.         åÛåÏI canåÛåªt go into too many details but they managed to get to a phone and make a call to usåÛå  she told Sky News . åÛåÏWe started to talk to them in depth when we could. It had to be prearranged when they were able to make calls to us and it had to be done very secretly because they felt they were in massive danger.åÛå         Working with Freedom Charity police officers managed to track down the home where the women were living. They moved swiftly to free them but then spent several weeks assembling evidence before making the arrests on Thursday.         Ms. Prem said she was still investigating how the women could have remained hidden from view for so long. åÛåÏIn a very busy capital city we often donåÛåªt know our neighborsåÛå  she told the BBC . åÛåÏWeåÛåªre looking at people who were kept against their will in an ordinary residential street in central London.åÛå         The women are at a secret location and are being questioned by interrogators who specialize in dealing with trauma victims the police said.         åÛåÏAll three women were deeply affected by this activity and traumatizedåÛå Detective Hyland said. åÛåÏIt was essential that we took things slowly in order to establish the facts of the period in what was alleged to be servitude or domestic labor.åÛå He added that because interrogators were treading carefully many of the details of the womenåÛåªs ordeal remained unknown or were emerging only slowly.         Detective Hyland said it was åÛåÏfair to suggest that the 30-year-old had no contact with the outside world that we would see as normal.åÛå         He added that he could not say whether she was the daughter of the arrested man.         åÛåÏWe donåÛåªt know whether the 30-year-old was born in the house but the 30-year-old has spent her whole life we believe in servitude or forced laboråÛå Detective Hyland said.

This was two summers ago in Pearland a suburb of Houston. There was a forbidding fibrous heap of dead ants on either side of the buildingåÛåªs double doors each a couple of feet long. And there were also legions of living ants shuffling over the dead ones åÛåÓ though Mike the Hog-a-Nator had to bend down to see these. Otherwise so many individual ants were moving so chaotically and so fast that the entire reddish-brown tangle at his feet looked as if it were shimmering. Mike the Hog-a-Nator remembers thinking:  What the world ? Then he went inside for his weekly appointment.         Six years earlier a doctor found a tumor on Mike the Hog-a-NatoråÛåªs aorta. It was inoperable. Mike who was only 36 was told to live every day as if it were his last. He narrowed his joys and priorities to two. The first was putting smiles on the faces of people who need them so he started a program he calls Therapy Through the Outdoors. Ever since he has been taking kids with terminal diseases and veterans with injuries or PTSD on adventures in the 60-acre woodland across from his house. The other was shooting as many feral hogs as he possibly could which is what he and the sick kids and the wounded warriors often do in the woods.         Mike hates feral hogs and has always found it very satisfying to clear those hideous rooting thugs off a piece of land. He has always been good at it too åÛåÓ thatåÛåªs why people call him Mike the Hog-a-Nator. (His real name is Mike Foshee.) Recently he even started marketing his own all-natural hog bait åÛåÏPork Smackåãå¢ Hog AttractantåÛå after months of refining the recipe. America has been filling up with invasive species since European settlers first arrived. Feral hogs which were brought to the continent five centuries ago are among the most gruesome and destructive. The federal government estimates that there are now five million hogs in 35 states resulting in $1.5 billion in damages and control costs every year. In its literature the Department of Agriculture calls the animals a åÛåÏpandemic.åÛå         But anyway the ants.         They arrived at Mike the Hog-a-NatoråÛåªs house a few months after he first saw them at the cardiologiståÛåªs office. One day his air conditioning stopped working. A musty smell seeped from the vents in his living-room floor. So he powered up his Shop-Vac to clear them. By the time he was done heåÛåªd sucked out five gallons of ants.         Soon he and his wife were waking up to find vast frantic networks of ants zipping around the kitchen floor in all directions. When the picture on their 50-inch box television started flickering Mike took off the back panel and found the guts throbbing with ants. He got rid of the television.         Outside dead ants began pooling around the base of the house in heaps so high that they looked like discarded coffee grounds. (ItåÛåªs common in Texas these days for a person who is shown one of these heaps of dead ants to take several seconds to realize that the solid surface he or she is scanning for ants actually  is  the ants.) Mike laid out poison generating more heaps of dead ants. But new ants merely used those dead ants as a bridge over the poison and kept streaming inside.         åÛåÏThey literally come in waves of just millionsåÛå Mike told me. (One Texas A&M entomologist confessed åÛåÏYou figure these stories are laced with hyperbole but when you get in there itåÛåªs unreal.åÛå) People donåÛåªt want to visit the Foshees anymore and if they do they leave quickly before the ants can stow away in their cars and accompany them home. This summer Mike had to cancel Therapy Through the Outdoors. Recently he and his wife were sitting outside watching a pair of bald eagles settle into a pecan tree for the evening when Mike looked down and saw one of his bare feet overtaken by ants. He remembers thinking  No no no no no no no no  running inside and running back out with his AR-15 the assault rifle he uses to take out hogs. He was about to open fire on the ants until his wife chuckled and he realized how ridiculous the situation had become.         åÛåÏThe distressing partåÛå he told me åÛåÏis having the feeling of something always crawling on you. Like if you get around somebody who has lice and now youåÛåªre always itching because you know they have lice.åÛå         åÛåÏSo itåÛåªs psychologicalåÛå I said.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs psychologicalåÛå he said. åÛåÏAnd yet you actually do have them on you.åÛå         He tried leaving different foods on his floor overnight to figure out how he might bait and kill the ants as he did with the feral hogs. He tried doughnuts crushed-up Cheerios bread crumbs åÛåÓ åÛåÏanything a normal ant would be attracted toåÛå he told me. He claims they touched none of it.         He canåÛåªt fathom what the ants want åÛåÓ why theyåÛåªve come. They are frightening because they make no sense because of the utter disarray of their existence. åÛåÏThey run around the floors like theyåÛåªre on crack and then they dieåÛå he said. åÛåÏTheyåÛåªre freakinåÛåª crazy man.åÛå          The ants are called  crazy ants. ThatåÛåªs their actual name. Many people call them Rasberry crazy ants and some people call them Tawny crazy ants and refuse to call them Rasberry crazy ants. The enmity between these people I found can be extraordinary.         Entomologists report that the crazy ants like other ants seem drawn to electronic devices åÛåÓ car stereos circuit boxes machinery. But with crazy ants so many will stream inside a device that they form a single squirming mass that completes a circuit and shorts it. Crazy ants have ruined laptops this way and according to one exterminator have also temporarily shut down chemical plants. They are most likely climbing into these cavities to investigate possible nesting sites. But as David Oi a research entomologist at the Department of Agriculture told me the science-fiction-ish theory that the bugs are actually attracted to the electricity itself canåÛåªt be ruled out.

That is what an animal rights group claimed on Monday when it filed a classic writ of habeas corpus that revered staple of American and English law and tired clichÌÄå© of detective fiction åÛåÓ not for a human being held unlawfully but for Tommy a chimpanzee in Gloversville N.Y.         This is no stunt. The  Nonhuman Rights Project  has been working on this legal strategy for years sifting through decisions in all 50 states to find one that is strong on what is called common law and one that recognizes animals as legal persons for the purpose of being the beneficiary of a trust.         The leader of the project Steven M. Wise who has written about the history of habeas corpus writs in the fight against human slavery and who views the crusade for animal rights as a lifelong project said New York fit the bill. His legal action added a milestone to a year that has already been remarkable for chimpanzees with one federal agency taking steps to retire most chimps owned by the government and another proposing to classify all chimps as endangered an action that would throw up new obstacles to experiments even on privately owned chimps.         Activists have relished their successes while some scientists have deplored restrictions on the use of the animals which have played a crucial role in some biomedical research such as work on hepatitis C vaccines.         Until now all the actions have addressed the issue of animal welfare not animal rights. But Mr. Wise filed  papers  on Monday in State Supreme Court in Fulton County N.Y. demanding that courts in New York recognize Tommy as a legal person with a right to liberty but one that has its limits.         Tommy the group says åÛåÏis being held captive in a cage in a shed at a used-trailer lot.åÛå         The petition does not ask the court to set Tommy free to roam Gloversville or to send him back to Africa after a life in captivity. It asks the court to remove him from his owners and place him in a sanctuary.         The group said it intended to file suit later this week on behalf of three more chimps in New York also demanding their freedom. Two of the chimpanzees are believed to be owned by the New Iberia Research Center at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette but are housed at Stony Brook University for a study of locomotion. The fourth according to the rights project is owned by Carmen Presti of Niagara Falls who runs the Primate Sanctuary a nonprofit organization that has monkeys and the one chimpanzee.         Patrick C. Lavery the owner of Circle L Trailer Sales in Gloversville where Tommy lives said he heard about the petition from reportersåÛåª telephone calls. He said from his home in Florida that he had complied with all state and federal regulations that Tommy had a spacious cage åÛåÏwith tons of toysåÛå and that he had been trying to place him in sanctuaries but that they had no room. He said he had rescued the chimp from his previous home where he was badly treated.         åÛåÏPeople ought to use common senseåÛå he said. Of the Nonhuman Rights Project a group he was not aware of he said åÛåÏIf they were to see where this chimp lived for the first 30 years of his life they would jump up and down for joy about where he is now.åÛå         The other people who are named in the petitions being filed this week did not immediately comment.         The use of habeas corpus actions is a time-honored legal strategy for addressing unlawful imprisonment of human beings. Mr. Wise argues in a 70-plus-page memo rich with legal scientific and philosophical references that being human is not essential to having rights. He argues that captive chimps are in fact enslaved and that the same principles apply to them as to humans who were enslaved.         åÛåÏThis petition asks this court to issue a writ recognizing that Tommy is not a legal thing to be possessed by respondents but rather is a cognitively complex autonomous legal person with the fundamental legal right not to be imprisonedåÛå the court filing says.

Ms. Racher assumed the culprit was another resident who sometimes wandered into her mother‰Ûªs room and fell asleep in her bed. So in 2012 Ms. Racher placed a motion-activated camera in her mother‰Ûªs room. It looked like an alarm clock and Ms. Racher nearly forgot about it. About two months later the family decided to pore through the recordings. The camera had not caught the petty thief. But it captured something else: An aide stuffed latex gloves into Mrs. Mayberry‰Ûªs mouth while another taunted her tapping her on the head laughing. Hoisting her from her wheelchair they flung her on a bed. One performed a few heavy-handed chest compressions. ‰ÛÏMy niece started bawling and couldn‰Ûªt watch anymore‰Û said Ms. Racher 78. ‰ÛÏI was furious.‰Û Mrs. Mayberry died soon after. On Nov. 1 propelled by the outcry over the Mayberry case Oklahoma became the third state ‰ÛÓ along with New Mexico and Texas ‰ÛÓ to explicitly permit residents in long-term care facilities to maintain surveillance cameras in their rooms. In the last two years at least five states have considered similar legislation. Although some states have administrative guidelines for electronic monitoring most legislative efforts have stalled because of questions about liability and in particular privacy rights raised by facility owners unions elder care lawyers and families. Despite such concerns not only have family members turned to these ‰ÛÏgranny cams‰Û ‰ÛÓ a popular nickname that some consider patronizing ‰ÛÓ but even the government has used them. A year ago the New York state attorney general‰Ûªs office which has  relied on hidden cameras in patient abuse and neglect cases for years  demonstrated its methods at a national training program for state investigators. In June Mike DeWine the Ohio state attorney general announced that his office with permission from families had placed cameras in residents‰Ûª rooms in an unspecified number of state facilities. Mr. DeWine has moved to shut down at least one facility in Zanesville where he said cameras caught actions like an aide‰Ûªs repeatedly leaving a stroke patient‰Ûªs food by his incapacitated side. The recordings can have an impact. Based on Ms. Racher‰Ûªs videos one aide pleaded guilty to abuse and neglect. The other appears to have fled the country. Similar scenes of abuse have been captured in  New Jersey   New York   Pennsylvania   Texas  and other states by relatives who placed cameras in potted plants and radios webcams and iPhones. The monitoring is often a last-ditch step by relatives who suspect abuse but feel that the authorities dismiss their complaints. ‰ÛÏFamilies are witnessing injuries and neglect of loved ones and the only way to detect what‰Ûªs happening is to use hidden cameras‰Û said Wes Bledsoe the founder of  A Perfect Cause  a group based in Oklahoma that tracks such cases around the country. Although no one tracks its use the technology is accessible affordable and widely accepted said Dan Frith a lawyer in Roanoke Va. who represents plaintiffs in neglect and abuse cases against long-term care facilities. ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm confident there are numerous granny cams in nursing homes in Virginia that people never discuss with the staff‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs a cheap quick way to verify.‰Û But the secret monitoring of a resident raises ethical and legal questions. Families must balance fears for their relative‰Ûªs safety against an undignified invasion of their privacy. They must also consider the privacy rights of others who pass through the room including roommates and visitors. Proponents of hidden cameras argue that expectations of privacy have fallen throughout society: nanny cams webcams and security cameras are ubiquitous. But others say that it is one thing to videotape a nanny in one‰Ûªs home who is putting a diaper on a 9-month-old and quite another to record an aide doing so for a 90-year-old. ‰ÛÏThis is infringing on someone‰Ûªs privacy arguably for their own benefitåÊ‰Û said  Nina A. Kohn  a law professor at Syracuse University. ‰ÛÏWe have to be especially careful that it‰Ûªs justified.‰Û A long-term care resident often lacks the capacity to consent to being recorded so the decision is usually made by a representative who may not be a relative. That decision maker has to stand in the resident‰Ûªs shoes Ms. Kohn said: If the resident were mentally capable would he or she agree to round-the-clock monitoring of many intimate moments ‰ÛÓ being bathed put on the toilet even having sexual relations with another resident? Ms. Racher said she never worried about violating her mother‰Ûªs privacy. ‰ÛÏCertainly the workers see your rear end anyway‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏSo if your family sees your naked behind what‰Ûªs the big deal?‰Û But residents often have roommates who state laws say have the right to refuse to be monitored. Maryland which has administrative guidelines for facilities says that cameras must be in a fixed position directed at only the intended resident. Another question is whether signs should be posted alerting staff members and visitors that monitoring is taking place. Certainly abuse has been exposed precisely because staff members did not know about hidden cameras. Mr. DeWine who said his Medicaid Fraud Control Unit pursued facilities only where there were extensive complaints refused to name other settings where his cameras were in place. If workers think they may be monitored but don‰Ûªt know for certain he said that uncertainty may deter abusive behavior. ‰ÛÏNotice is not necessary‰Û he said and ‰ÛÏwould defeat the purpose.‰Û But many privacy experts believe that notification benefits everyone. Facilities that permit in-room monitoring usually require families to post a notice on the resident‰Ûªs door. In recent years facilities themselves have placed signs that cameras are in public areas like lobbies and dining halls. ‰ÛÏNotification encourages transparency and reaffirms shared expectations for quality care‰Û said Joseph DeMattos the president of the  Health Facilities Association of Maryland  which represents long-term care and rehabilitation centers. Dr. Laura Mosqueda  a geriatrician in Irvine Calif. has misgivings about cameras but feels that with careful consent and notice the practice can be put to good purpose. ‰ÛÏThe documentation in nursing homes can be so poor that you can‰Ûªt tell what‰Ûªs going on and you don‰Ûªt know who to blame‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏGood caregivers can be unfairly accused.‰Û But the effect of monitoring on employees is debatable. Unlike the residents who expect privacy because their room is essentially their home workers cannot assume that their actions are going unrecorded. Some facilities have lobbied against electronic monitoring legislation. Unions also dislike cameras particularly when they are placed without notice. ‰ÛÏWhen you have low-wage health care workers in difficult settings they feel subjected to scrutiny and attack‰Û said Anthony Caldwell a spokesman for the  Service Employees International Union District 1199  whose local represents aides in Kentucky Ohio and West Virginia. ‰ÛÏSecret surveillance takes away from their professionalism. It‰Ûªs unfortunate and creepy and wrong.‰Û Greg Crist a spokesman for the  American Health Care Association  which represents about 9000 skilled nursing centers said each state must write its own laws about monitoring. ‰ÛÏOur caregivers are often the new families of these residents‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏWe want that to be an ongoing trust-based collaborative relationship.‰Û Dr. Mark S. Lachs  a geriatrician and a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College is concerned that recordings may be misinterpreted. Nursing home residents he said can become  combative delirious and resistant to care . ‰ÛÏA jury could view a skilled kind loving nursing assistant trying to bathe the person with advanced cognitive challenges who is saying ‰Û÷Stop stop stop!‰ÛªåÊ‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏAnd that assistant could be misconstrued as abusive.‰Û Regulation is needed he said to detail when and how monitoring may occur who owns the recordings and who may watch them. Use of hidden cameras may catch bad actors after the fact but can monitoring help redress the deep-seated problems at many facilities? Marie-Therese Connolly a former Justice Department coordinator of the Elder Justice and Nursing Home Initiative said ‰ÛÏWe shouldn‰Ûªt rely on them to substitute for proper staffing and training which are better ways to assure quality.‰Û All open questions åÈ Marathon half-marathon 10k and 5K training plans to get you race ready.

Well over 100000 people have been killed in the two-year conflict between President Bashar al-Assad and rebels. The United Nations says about 6.5 million people have fled their homes within Syria and 2.3 million sought refuge abroad.         SNC chief Ahmed Jarba issued the plea at a high-profile summit in Kuwait of leaders of the six Gulf Arab monarchies.         ""The first step of aid is to support our people now with an aid fund ... and that will be under the supervision and management of the Syrian National Coalition"" he said.         ""You know the size of the tragedy for the refugees and the displaced people inside and outside of Syria."" Kuwait's emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah took up Jarba's appeal.         ""(A) human catastrophe is still ongoing in Syria which calls on us to redouble our efforts and work with the international community particularly the U.N. Security Council which unfortunately has remained unable to play its role and put an end to this human catastrophe"" the emir said.         Donor countries meeting in Kuwait in January pledged more than $1.5 billion for Syrians affected by the civil war with about $1 billion earmarked for other countries in the region hosting refugees and $500 million for humanitarian aid to Syrians displaced inside the country.         The oil-producing Gulf Arab states of Kuwait Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates each promised $300 million at the January meeting. Qatar later pledged $100 million in aid.         Kuwait will host a second fund-raising conference next month.         (Reporting by Rania El Gamal; Editing by Ralph Boulton)        "

The sidewalks were empty. They no longer belonged to hucksters heartbreakers and flocks of friends decked out and glassy-eyed. They belonged to me. I ran past the hushed fountains of the Bellagio over eye-popping cards for escorts and strip clubs that littered the streets like ticker tape on my way to the first of several weekend fitness classes: Yoga Among the Dolphins.         There was a time when yoga and Sin City were like fire and ice. But practicing a tree pose while a family of bottlenose dolphins looks on is just one of many health initiatives being introduced by hotels once known only for bars buffets and smoky casinos.         The  Mirage Hotel & Casino  has cornered the dolphin-Ashtanga market (weåÛåªll revisit that later) but its competitors have their own offbeat mind-body prescriptions.  Trump Hotel  recently introduced a boot camp class outside on the Strip.  Aria Resort & Casino  offers an hourlong åÛåÏindoor hikeåÛå through the 3.8 million-square-foot property and adjacent  Shops at Crystals .  MGM Grand  has Stay Well rooms where shower water is infused with vitamin C and air-purification systems promise to reduce toxins. And the  Mandarin Oriental åÛåªs Tea Lounge serves vegan food and åÛåÏhealth & wellnessåÛå tea blends that sound hallucinogenic with names like åÛåÏpeace through wateråÛå and åÛåÏintrospection.åÛå         Las Vegas it seems has begun to follow the lead of other major tourist destinations. After all wellness isnåÛåªt just good for you åÛåÓ itåÛåªs good for hoteliers. åÛåÏWellness tourismåÛå is a $438.6 billion worldwide market and itåÛåªs projected to grow almost 10 percent a year through 2017 according to a study conducted for the Global Spa & Wellness Summit by SRI International a nonprofit research institute.         IåÛåªd been to Vegas a couple of times though itåÛåªs not my idea of a vacation. I aim to unwind. Las Vegas winds you up. But a healthy Vegas getaway? It was too amusing an option not to explore. To see how far I could push it I set personal ground rules: No alcohol. No buffets. No smoking. No gambling. All of that of course is built into the guts of this town. Yet there are other deeper stories: of railroads the Hoover Dam Lake Mead and the desert with its wild burros and ancient Joshua trees. Such places provide ample opportunity for fresh air and exercise. But not it would seem the Strip that four-mile or so stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard.         Pity the reluctant visitor who ends up here for the obligatory convention or party. What respite could she (or he) find? There was only one way to know: I would go to the heart of the Strip and limit all healthful endeavors to its environs (with one exception). And with that I set off alone with a duffel bag of sneakers and spandex to roll the dice on wholesome Las Vegas.         It was Saturday night and MGM Grand smelled like a frat party. The lobby was teeming with young people vogueing for smartphone cameras: men in sunglasses women who one day would master walking in platform stilettos but not tonight. I snaked through stanchions and joined the check-in queue somewhere behind a woman in sneakers and a white veil as the Icona Pop song åÛåÏI Love ItåÛå blared: åÛåÏ I donåÛåªt care! I love it! I donåÛåªt care!åÛå    Ten minutes later I received a room key emblazoned with the word åÛåÏrejuvenateåÛå and felt a twinge of anticipation. Yet walking to the elevators with my duffel was like being a steel ball in a pinball machine. I zigzagged amid partygoers and slot machines past the Corner Cakes Pastry Shop near which I encountered stacks of my weakness: ReeseåÛåªs Peanut Butter Cups. I looked away and sped by hitting everyone and everything or maybe they were hitting me. Still with each thwack I reminded myself that I was getting ever closer to rejuvenation.         Or not.         Shrieks. Laughter. Something that sounded like barking. Was there a party ... in my room? I cautiously put the key in the lock. No. But it sure sounded that way. I tossed my bag on a chair and called the front desk. Security kindly offered to quell the party but I didnåÛåªt want to spoil the fun. I just wanted a room change. While on hold I skimmed some nearby information cards.         åÛåÏGet all the zzzåÛåªs you needåÛå said one.         åÛåÏWho knew Las Vegas could feel so rejuvenating?åÛå said another noting that the roomåÛåªs åÛåÏwellness technologies from real-estate pioneer Delios in conjunction with the Cleveland Clinic and Dr. Deepak Chopra are designed to help you tailor your Las Vegas experience and make it whatever youåÛåªd like it to be åÛåÓ including relaxing.åÛå         I was still on hold. After hanging up calling back and getting a supervisor on the phone I was told they didnåÛåªt have another available Stay Well room. I pointed out that if a hotel bills a room as a place to åÛåÏget all the zzzåÛåªs you needåÛå guests have a reasonable expectation that the room will have some measure of tranquillity.         åÛåÏWe did not modify the wallsåÛå the supervisor said adding that the Stay Well rooms are no quieter than any other room at MGM Grand.

An American military veteran åÛåÓ alienated and adrift after a war åÛåÓ wanders through a chilly European city in December. He pals around with an intelligent and alluring young woman about half his age; at bars and cafes he encounters fellow expatriates as well as natives who view his wealth and nationality with envy and suspicion.         If youåÛåªve read enough Graham Greene Paul Bowles or Robert Stone you may think you know whatåÛåªs coming. YouåÛåªre ready for a shift the moment when the calm mood will be shattered replaced by something sinister even violent. But though a sense of dread hovers over much of Greg BaxteråÛåªs lucidly written and astutely observed debut novel åÛåÏThe ApartmentåÛå that drastic change never arrives.         The novel is set in an unnamed city one where åÛåÏintense joy and intense sorrow are extinct.åÛå The city and the locations in it are fictional but they recall aspects of Vienna Budapest and Berlin where Mr. Baxter who was born in Texas now lives. There are streetcars; Christmas markets; a park with a zoo and a natural history museum; cafes with good coffee and rich creamy desserts; outdoor stands where you can buy sausages served with sharp mustard and brown bread.         Our guide through this city is unnamed too but he is familiar enough: Stoic and cynical yet literary and intellectually curious he splits the difference between Jake Barnes in åÛåÏThe Sun Also RisesåÛå and Ethan HawkeåÛåªs character in åÛåÏBefore Sunset.åÛå He has moved to Europe to forget his past but he spends long stretches of the novel engaged in the act of remembering.         Forty-one years old he served first as a Navy officer on submarines then as a reservist called up to Iraq where he worked in intelligence. After his tour he started his own company returning to Baghdad to set up I.T. networks and conduct computer surveillance netting himself a fortune. The characteråÛåªs sudden attainment of wealth is hardly unusual in the economy depicted by Mr. Baxter with war and big business both conducted by remote.         Describing an old neighbor in America who worked from home securing government contracts and selling everything from tortilla-making machines to Tomahawk missiles Mr. BaxteråÛåªs narrator opines it åÛåÏseemed kind of insane to me that the very natural idea of wanting to be successful in order to create a comfortable life for your family had here taken such a bighearted unassuming funny guy and placed him in the heart of darkness.åÛå         åÛåÏThe ApartmentåÛå takes place in a single day and appropriately the novel itself is short enough to be read almost in real time over a leisurely afternoon and evening. We follow the narrator who has been living in a hotel as he tries to find an apartment. He is aided in this odyssey by Saskia a smart hard-partying 25-year-old economics student whom he met at a gallery opening.         There is an endearing effortlessness to their relationship but åÛåÏThe ApartmentåÛå is no more a torrid love story than it is the sort of postwar espionage thriller it frequently evokes while depicting a 21st century in which American power has waned considerably. In the new world order Mr. BaxteråÛåªs narrator is not so much a åÛåÏquiet AmericanåÛå as he is an increasingly irrelevant American.         To relate what does happen in åÛåÏThe ApartmentåÛå might make it sound slight a novel-length minimalist exercise. Mr. Baxter characterizes Camp Victory in Iraq as a place with åÛåÏa stupefying lack of dramaåÛå which proves to be an apt description of his novelåÛåªs plot as well.         The narrator goes apartment-hunting with Saskia; he settles on a place; he and Saskia meet up with her friend Manuela who works for the central bank; the narrator buys a fancy winter coat that according to an observer makes him look like Adolf Eichmann whose name suggests the banality of the evil our narrator remembers committing in Iraq; the narrator Saskia and Manuela shoot pool; he and Saskia plan what theyåÛåªll eat for breakfast. When there is violence the narrator is either remembering it imagining it or watching it from a far remove; when there is drama it has usually happened in some distant past. But despite the lack of incident the novel exerts a hypnotic force.         One of Mr. BaxteråÛåªs most entertaining and insightful sequences occurs when his narrator encounters a fellow veteran a former Army guy named Early who chews tobacco speaks with a drawl and blasts the Oak Ridge Boys while tooling around in a black Range Rover. But midway in the conversation Early drops the accent and turns off the tunes.         åÛåÏIåÛåªm only messing with youåÛå he says. Turns out Early is a history buff who is a fan of åÛåÏThe AeneidåÛå and the composer Alban Berg thus undercutting our expectations for a war vet character just as Mr. Baxter continually undercuts our expectations for his novel.         And it is precisely this sort of subversion along with the authoråÛåªs shimmering prose that makes åÛåÏThe ApartmentåÛå such a surprisingly compelling read and so apropos; it captures the mood of the current moment and what seems to be a new åÛåÏlost generationåÛå one formed not so much by exposure to violence as immunity to and alienation from it. Once upon a time there was no place like home; in Mr. BaxteråÛåªs world home it seems is no place.

Jones comes before you for sentencing for conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine.         SheåÛåªs a 32-year-old mom with a 9-year-old daughter and no prior arrests but  she has been caught up in a drug sweep  that has led to 105 arrests in her Texas town. Everyone arrested is black.         There are no drugs found on Jones but her supposed co-conspirators testify against her in exchange for reduced sentences. The whole case is dubious but she has been convicted. WhatåÛåªs your sentence?         You have little choice. Given the presumptions of the case she gets a mandatory minimum sentence of life without the possibility of parole. Jump to today and already Jones has spent 14 years in prison and is expected to die behind bars åÛåÓ for a first offense.         At a time when  America has been slashing preschool programs  we have also been spending vast sums to incarcerate  thousands of nonviolent offenders in life sentences  without any possibility of parole. These cases underscore that our mass incarceration experiment has resulted in monstrous injustice and waste åÛåÓ a waste of tax dollars and of human lives.         Judges and prison officials are rebelling at the injustice of our justice system. HereåÛåªs what Judge James R. Spencer a federal district judge said when sentencing a former F.B.I. informant to life without parole for selling crack cocaine to support his own addiction: åÛåÏA life sentence for what you have done in this case is ridiculous; it is a travesty.åÛå         But federal law on mandatory minimums left Judge Spencer no leeway. He added: åÛåÏI donåÛåªt agree with it either. And I want the world and the record to be clear on that. This is just silly.åÛå         Here are some other nonviolent offenders serving life sentences without the possibility of parole:         åÛå¢ Ricky Minor a meth addict and father of three was found with 1.2 grams of meth in his home along with over-the-counter decongestants that can be used to manufacture meth. He was initially charged under Florida law and says he faced a two-and-a-half-year sentence. Later indicted under federal law he pleaded guilty because his public defender said that otherwise the prosecutors would also pursue his wife leaving no one to raise their children. Minor had several prior nonviolent offenses for which he had never served time and these required Judge Clyde Roger Vinson to sentence him to life without parole. Judge Vinson said that the sentence åÛåÏfar exceeds whatever punishment would be appropriate.åÛå         åÛå¢ Dicky Joe Jackson was a trucker whose 2-year-old son Cole needed a bone-marrow transplant to save his life. The family raised $50000 through community fund-raisers not nearly enough for the transplant and Jackson tried to earn the difference by carrying meth in his truck. He has now been in prison for the last 17 years; when he lost  his last appeal  he divorced his wife of 19 years so that she could start over in her life. The federal prosecutor in the case acknowledged: åÛåÏI saw no indication that Mr. Jackson was violent that he was any sort of large-scale narcotics trafficker or that he committed his crimes for any reason other than to get money to care for his gravely ill child.åÛå         åÛå¢ Danielle Metz became pregnant at 17 and later married an abusive man who was also a drug dealer. To placate him she says she sometimes helped him by fetching cocaine or collecting money from Western Union. After one clash in which he punched her in the face she took the kids and left him. Two months later  she was indicted . She says that she was prosecuted primarily to induce her to testify against her husband but that she wasnåÛåªt knowledgeable enough to have useful information to trade for a reduced sentence. She has now spent more than 20 years in prison.         Those examples come from a devastating new report åÛåÏ A Living Death åÛå by the American Civil Liberties Union. It identified more than 3200 such nonviolent offenders sentenced to die behind bars.         Four out of five are black or Hispanic. Virtually all are poor. Many had dismal legal counsel. Some were convicted of crimes committed when they were juveniles or very young adults.         These people are victims of AmericaåÛåªs disastrous experiment in mass incarceration. From the 1930s through the early 1970s we  incarcerated people at a steady rate . Since then incarceration rates have roughly quintupled. America now imprisons people at more than five times  the rates of most Western countries .         I write often about human rights abuses abroad. But when we take young nonviolent offenders åÛåÓ some of them never arrested before åÛåÓ and sentence them to die in prison itåÛåªs time for Americans who care about injustice to gaze in the mirror.

But as they huddled in morning meetings on an unusually somber lot here it was clear there were still far more questions than answers.         The death of  Paul Walker  40 would have presented substantial challenges for Universal under the best of circumstances. To finish åÛåÏFast & Furious 7åÛå in time for a planned July 11 release the company has been  operating under an aggressive  little-room-for-delays production schedule. Filming is still only half finished unusual for a movie of this size so close to release and Mr. Walker played a leading role.         But the manner of Mr. WalkeråÛåªs death åÛåÓ he died in a fiery car crash eerily similar to what the åÛåÏFast & FuriousåÛå movies present as entertainment åÛåÓ amplifies the challenges. Even if the script can be reworked it could be hard to motivate a close-knit cast to quickly resume filming happy-go-lucky car chase sequences. It could be more challenging to sensitively market a film filled with fast driving and exploding cars.         åÛåÏBecause there is this horrible irony where life is imitating art they have a very very fine line to walk both with revisions to the script and in the marketing campaignåÛå said Dennis Rice a marketing consultant who has held top positions at Miramax United Artists and Disney.         åÛåÏThey will succeed in the end in part because they muståÛå he added. åÛåÏAs horrible as his death was there is a business investment to protect.åÛå         The åÛåÏFast & FuriousåÛå movies cost roughly $150 million to produce and at least $100 million more to market. The  blockbuster franchise  has taken in about $3 billion at the box office over the last 12 years after adjusting for inflation. åÛåÏFast & Furious 7åÛå is by far UniversalåÛåªs biggest movie for 2014.         A Universal spokeswoman had no comment on Monday.         People with knowledge of the studioåÛåªs internal response who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of respect for Mr. Walker and his family described a leadership team that put aside their own emotions and swiftly began to deal with the crisis.         When word reached the studio late Saturday afternoon of Mr. WalkeråÛåªs death executives were still scattered for the Thanksgiving holiday. The studioåÛåªs communications executive nonetheless managed to rush out a heartfelt  public statement . åÛåÏThis loss is devastating to usåÛå it read in part. åÛåÏPaul was truly one of the most beloved and respected members of our studio family.åÛå         Ron Meyer who became vice chairman of NBC Universal and his two top movie officers Jeff Shell chairman of the Universal Filmed Entertainment Group and Donna Langley chairwoman of Universal Pictures divided duties. Mr. Meyer personally called Mr. WalkeråÛåªs family members every åÛåÏFast & FuriousåÛå cast member their agents and dozens of other production personnel.         Ms. Langley and her lieutenants began to assess how the production might be salvaged poring through scripts and film already shot. Mr. Shell would sort out business and legal questions concerning production delays.         Still to be decided: Do they write his death into the film? Cut his performance? Hire another actor to finish his role? Universal is helped by the franchise itself movie experts say because the films have a history of mismatched story lines and also began relying more on crime stories playing down dangerous street racing.         Public safety announcements to go with DVDs of the film were recorded. Mr. Walker  recorded one . åÛåÏAll the driving sequences you see in the film are done by experienced professionals on closed courses. Be safe. Drive smart. Stay legal.åÛå

""We have to realize that there is not a single moment to lose that every effort has to be made every day to bring the construction of Olympic sites and infrastructure forward"" said IOC president Thomas Bach.         Rio Games Organizers have been repeatedly urged to speed up progress as the country struggles to prepare for the world's two biggest sports events - the 2014 soccer World Cup and the  2016 Olympics .         Bach said he was planning to visit Brazil before February and would meet Brazil President Dilma Rousseff to help improve work between the government and Organizers.         ""What will be essential and crucial for the success of Rio will be a seamless cooperation and coordination among different levels of government and the organizing committee"" Bach told reporters.         ""To ensure this I will most likely travel with the (IOC) delegation to Rio and Brasilia even before the Sochi Games (in February) to speak with the president of Brazil and speak with other levels of government and the organizing committee in such a way to ensure this... because this is definitely needed to have successful Games and to meet the schedules.""         With the country already struggling to meet deadlines for next year's World Cup Games Organizers have yet to finalize the overall budget less than three years before the event while also dropping behind in constructing the venues.         Bach said the IOC's Olympic Games executive director Gilbert Felli who is retiring in August will only deal with Rio progress after the Sochi Olympics and will continue to do so even after his retirement in an effort to speed up work.         ""We have had a request on behalf of the Rio organizing committee to put Mr Felli at the disposal of the organizing committee"" said Bach.         ""After Sochi Mr Felli's top priority will be close cooperation with the Rio organizing committee and even after his retirement at the end of August he will continue to work closely with Rio 2016.""

But compensation for military personnel has to be on the table too åÛåÓ even though no other defense issue is more politically volatile or emotionally fraught.         After a decade of war the very idea of cutting benefits to soldiers sailors and Marines who put their lives on the line seems ungrateful. But AmericaåÛåªs involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan is over or winding down and the Pentagon is obliged to find nearly $1 trillion in savings over 10 years. Tough choices will be required in all parts of the budget. Compensation includes pay retirement benefits health care and housing allowances. It consumes about half the military budget and it is increasing.         In a speech last month Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel warned that without serious savings in this area åÛåÏwe risk becoming an unbalanced force one that is well compensated but poorly trained and equipped with limited readiness and capability.åÛå Meanwhile Gen. Ray Odierno the Army chief of staff told a hearing: åÛåÏThe cost of a soldier has doubled since 2001; itåÛåªs going to almost double again by 2025. We canåÛåªt go on like this so we have to come up with [new] compensation packages.åÛå         The Wall Street Journal reported recently that military commanders have agreed to a plan that would curb the growth of pay and benefits for housing education and health. But it must still be approved by Mr. Hagel and President Obama. In past years Congress has approved pay raises and benefit improvements and resisted rollbacks. It is possible that politically savvy Pentagon leaders may be hitting the personnel issue hard right now to force lawmakers to end the sequester or to otherwise soften its blow to the overall military budget. Personnel costs are not the only ones rising. Weapons procurement has risen 88 percent from 2001 to 2012.         But many Washington-based think tanks spanning all ideologies are also pushing reform. In June a group of them åÛåÓ including the conservative American Enterprise Institute and the liberal Center for American Progress åÛåÓ called for a comprehensive review and modernization of the military compensation system which has been largely unchanged for 40 years.         One problem is that unrestrained compensation costs will edge out funds for training readiness and weapons. A recent Congressional Budget Office study said that between 2001 and 2012 when private-sector wages were effectively flat basic military pay rose by 28 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars. The study also said that cash compensation for enlisted personnel including food and housing allowances is greater than the wages and salaries of 90 percent of their civilian counterparts. And health care costs are projected to rise from $51 billion in 2013 to $77 billion by 2022.         Where then to cut? Reducing the size of the armed forces would have the quickest effect. The budget office suggests giving smaller pay raises; replacing the current retirement system under which active-duty members qualify for immediate benefits after 20 years of service with a defined benefit system that partially vests earlier in a service memberåÛåªs career; and increasing health care enrollment fees deductibles or co-payments. Military retirees pay only a fraction of what civilians pay for health care premiums and those with second careers often choose to stay on the government plan. It makes sense that they be asked to assume a greater share. To the extent possible any changes should affect future recruits rather than current enlistees.         Soldiers must be adequately compensated. But when programs across the government are being slashed including those affecting the most vulnerable Americans no budget account can be immune from reductions and reforms. It is a difficult balance to get right.

The  one-page document  released on Monday by retailers after meetings with the Rev.  Al Sharpton  and other civil rights advocates is the latest and most public effort by stores in New York City to respond to accusations of profiling of black shoppers. Three customers have sued in recent months and many others have informally shared their tales of unpleasant encounters while shopping in the city.         åÛåÏProfiling is an unacceptable practice and will not be toleratedåÛå reads the document to be posted in coming days in stores like BloomingdaleåÛåªs Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue. åÛåÏEmployees who violate the companyåÛåªs prohibition on profiling will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.åÛå         The document which draws from existing store policies prohibiting racial profiling amounts to a promise from retailers to abide by those strictures and a recognition of the deep resonance that reports of profiling have had with a large number of minority shoppers.         åÛåÏIf there was not a problem there would be no reason to post itåÛå Mr. Sharpton said in a telephone interview. åÛåÏThe added pressure is that theyåÛåªve acknowledged specific rights.åÛå         Among those rights outlined in the document is a requirement for store security personnel åÛåÓ some of whom roam the aisles in plainclothes åÛåÓ to identify themselves when interacting with customers. Prohibited is åÛåÏthe use of excessive forceåÛå or åÛåÏthreatening vulgar languageåÛå when detaining people suspected of theft. People suspected of engaging in a crime can be detained åÛåÏonly in a reasonable manner and not for more than a reasonable time.åÛå         It also defines profiling broadly to include not only race religion and sexual orientation but also åÛåÏappearance or any personal or physical characteristics.åÛå         åÛåÏI think itåÛåªs a marketing ployåÛå said John Elefterakis a lawyer for Robert Brown an actor in the HBO television series åÛåÏTremeåÛå who is suing MacyåÛåªs over a stop this year. åÛåÏWe donåÛåªt believe that this is a solution. WeåÛåªre moving forward with our lawsuit.åÛå         The suits against the stores and the  New York Police Department  were filed after episodes this year at MacyåÛåªs and Barneys in which black shoppers were stopped by officers after making purchases with their credit or debit cards. None were charged with a crime. The stores have denied any involvement on the part of their employees blaming the police. The Police Department has said its officers acted on information provided by the stores.         The state attorney generalåÛåªs office and the cityåÛåªs Human Rights Commission are conducting parallel investigations into the episodes and into store security practices more broadly.         åÛåÏThe policies in place are not adequateåÛå said  Scott M. Stringer  the Manhattan borough president and comptroller-elect who took part in the meetings with store officials. åÛåÏWe have a lot more work to do.åÛå         Mr. Stringer and Mr. Sharpton said they had requested a meeting with the incoming police commissioner William J. Bratton to discuss how officers collaborate with security personnel inside stores.

In most years the biggest concern is a teamåÛåªs being dropped into the hardest first-round matchup the so-called Group of Death. This time with the strongest field in memory åÛåÓ 23 of the top 25 teams in the world and every past winner qualified åÛåÓ there will probably be more than enough morbid talk to go around.         The four pots from which the teams will be drawn were announced Tuesday:          POT 1 (SEEDED TEAMS)  Brazil Spain Germany Argentina Colombia Belgium Switzerland and Uruguay          POT 2 (AFRICA/SOUTH AMERICA)  Algeria Cameroon Ivory Coast Ghana Nigeria Chile and Ecuador          POT 3 (ASIA/NORTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA)  United States Costa Rica Honduras Mexico Australia Iran Japan and South Korea          POT 4 (EUROPE)  Bosnia-Herzegovina Croatia England France Greece Italy the Netherlands Portugal and Russia.         As fans wait for the draw to begin here are answers to some questions they might be asking:           What are Switzerland and Colombia doing in the seeded pot?   The seeded teams were set according to the October  FIFA world rankings  which since 2006 have attempted to quantify a teamåÛåªs performance over the previous four years by accounting for strength of schedule and giving more weight to recent results before assigning a rating. With everyone judged by the same mathematical formulas the results make perfect sense. Or none at all åÛåÓ especially for those who think their team is better than for example Switzerland or Colombia both of which are in Pot 1. (This year the usual group of aggrieved fans is overwhelmingly Dutch Italian and English.)         But despite the complaints neither the Colombians nor the Swiss look to be walkovers for whichever teams are lucky enough to avoid Germany Spain and Brazil. Colombia finished second in South American qualifying behind Argentina and in two recent friendlies it beat Belgium and tied the Netherlands. Switzerland also coasted in qualifying allowing six goals in 10 games. And until they dropped a largely meaningless friendly in South Korea in November the Swiss had not lost a game in a year and a half. Be careful what you wish for.           Why are the pots uneven?   This imbalance will be the first thing sorted out Friday. The main complication of the draw every four years is how to scatter the European teams åÛåÓ which account for more than a third of the field åÛåÓ among the various groups. This year there are nine unseeded European teams. Before FridayåÛåªs draw one will be randomly selected to join the African teams and the two unseeded South American squads in Pot 2. That will be a dangerous position since the odd team out is guaranteed another European opponent out of Pot 4 but also has a 50-50 chance of drawing either Argentina or Brazil from the seeded pot.         In past years that potentially difficult position would have gone to the lowest-seeded team from Europe. This year that would be France which  clearly benefits  from a random draw rather than an automatic placement into that precarious spot.         The decision to go with chance over precedent announced only this week rankled some in Europe (again predominantly the Dutch the Italians and the English) who assert that FIFA rewrote the rules as a favor to the powerful UEFA president the former French star Michel Platini. He has pushed back against that insinuation saying that he offered to leave the room when the decision was made but was told to stay. åÛåÏI am not the only Frenchman in FIFAåÛå he said in what was surely a curious defense.           Any other intrigue to watch for?   The United States is a victim of circumstance this time around since the four teams from its region were grouped with the four Asian qualifiers. That means it has five of the six lowest-ranked teams in the field åÛåÓ Honduras (41) Iran (45) Japan (48) South Korea (54) Australia (59) åÛåÓ in its pot and therefore cannot be drawn against any of them. In fact the Americans at No. 14 are clearly the best team in Pot 3. For once that means most European countries are hoping to avoid them.         Other than that the only gymnastics fans can expect will be those required to ensure that no more than two European teams are in any group. If a third is drawn it will be placed in the first available spot that avoids that.           Are opponents the teamsåÛåª biggest worry?   Yes and no. Of course if you are United States Coach Jurgen Klinsmann a potential group of Colombia Bosnia-Herzegovina and Greece looks a lot better than one of Brazil the Netherlands and Ghana. But the location of a teamåÛåªs three first-round games could be just as big an obstacle. Brazil is the fifth-largest country in the world by area and it could comfortably fit the three previous World Cup hosts åÛåÓ South Africa; Germany; and Japan and South Korea åÛåÓ within its borders. A result is that teams  could face arduous travel  in the first round from their home bases to matches in far-flung cities.         For example the top seed in Group D will have to cover almost 3000 miles hopscotching to games in Fortaleza and Natal in the north and SÌÄå£o Paulo in the south. The top seed in group H meanwhile will get the much simpler task of ferrying between the comparatively nearby cities of Belo Horizonte Rio de Janeiro and SÌÄå£o Paulo åÛåÓ three trips that in total cover less than 500 miles. Add in temperature variations and varying numbers of rest days and it is clear as England Manager Roy Hodgson noted this week that it could be more important where a team plays than whom it plays.

Charged in her death were two drifters from Colorado drawn to the region by the allure of easy money in the oil fields.         One hundred fifty miles away in a bustling oil town in North Dakota a 30-year-old man disappeared one afternoon from the street where he had been putting in water and sewer pipes leaving behind a lunchbox with his paycheck inside and a family grasping for answers. After months of searching his mother said she now believes her son is gone buried somewhere on the high plain.         Stories like these once rare have become as common as drilling rigs in rural towns at the heart of one of the nationåÛåªs richest oil booms. Crime has soared as thousands of workers and rivers of cash have flowed into towns straining police departments and shattering residentsåÛåª sense of safety.         åÛåÏIt just feels like the modern-day Wild WeståÛå said Sgt. Kylan Klauzer an investigator in Dickinson in western North Dakota. The Dickinson police handled 41 violent crimes last year up from seven only five years ago.         To the police and residents the violence shows how a modern-day gold rush is transforming the rolling plains and farm towns where people once fretted about a population drain. Today four-story chain hotels are rising and small apartments rent for $2000 a month. Two-lane roads are jammed with tractor-trailers. Fast-food restaurants offer $300 signing bonuses for new employees and jobs as gas station attendants can pay $50000 a year. Workers flush with cash are snapping up A.T.V.s and hotel menus offer crab and artichoke dip and bacon-wrapped dates.         Amid all of that new money reports of assault and theft have doubled or even tripled and the police say they are rushing from call to call grappling with everything from bar brawls and shoplifting to kidnappings and attempted murders. Traffic stops for drunken or reckless driving have skyrocketed; local jails are spilling over with drug suspects.         Last year  a study  by officials in Montana and North Dakota found that crime had risen by 32 percent since 2005 in communities at the center of the boom. In Watford City N.D. where mile-long chains of tractor-trailers stack up at the townåÛåªs main traffic light arrests increased 565 percent during that time. In Roosevelt County in Montana arrests were up 855 percent and the sheriff Freedom Crawford said his jail was so full that he was ticketing and releasing offenders for minor crimes like disorderly conduct.         åÛåÏI donåÛåªt have nowhere to put themåÛå Sheriff Crawford said.         Officials say that most of the new arrivals are hard workers who are simply looking for better lives and that much of the increase in crime has resulted from population growth: Waves of new residents inevitably mean more traffic crashes and calls to 911.         Police and sheriffåÛåªs departments are responding by hiring more officers in part with new tax revenue but often not fast enough to keep pace with their booming populations. In Dickinson for example the population has surged to an estimated 25000 from 16000 in 2000 with new hotels condominiums and extended-stay inns being built every week. The cityåÛåªs police department has 38 officers but Sergeant Klauzer said it would need to add 12 more to keep up with the growth. Each detectiveåÛåªs caseload has doubled.         Once a month Sergeant Klauzer receives a phone call from a mother looking for news about her son Eric Haider the 30-year-old pipe layer who vanished in May 2012 one of several disappearances in the region. Mr. Haider hated the tiring three-hour commute to his job in Dickinson but the townåÛåªs breakneck growth meant steady work and money to support his daughter said his mother Maryellen Suchan.         The family has made buttons and printed fliers with Mr. HaideråÛåªs brown-bearded face and has silk-screened T-shirts with the words åÛåÏHave You Seen My Son?åÛå The police dug up the streets and searched with dogs. As hopes dimmed Mr. HaideråÛåªs family began asking hunters and oil workers to look out for shallow graves. Not a trace has been found.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs a living nightmareåÛå Ms. Suchan said. åÛåÏThere isnåÛåªt a single day that we donåÛåªt think of him talk of him. I donåÛåªt have an end.åÛå

The figure represents a slight increase from the 0.7 percent reached in the three months to October.

The documents which also include spreadsheets that list the bank‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏtrack record‰Û for converting hires into business deals offer the most detailed account yet of JPMorgan‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏSons and Daughters‰Û  hiring program  which has been at the center of a federal bribery investigation for months. The spreadsheets and emails ‰ÛÓ recently submitted by JPMorgan to authorities ‰ÛÓ illuminate how the bank created the program to prevent questionable hiring practices but ultimately viewed it as a gateway to doing business with state-owned companies in China which commonly issue stock with the help of Wall Street banks.

In the email citing the ‰ÛÏexisting and potential business opportunities‰Û a senior JPMorgan executive in Hong Kong emphasized that the father of a job candidate was the chairman of the China Everbright Group a state-controlled financial conglomerate. The executive also extolled the broader benefits of the hiring program telling colleagues in another email: ‰ÛÏYou all know I have always been a big believer of the Sons and Daughters program ‰ÛÓ it almost has a linear relationship‰Û with winning assignments to advise Chinese companies. Until now the indications of a connection between the hires and business deals have not been so explicit. In addition to the documents interviews with current and former JPMorgan employees suggest that some people inside or affiliated with the bank bristled at the hiring strategy. At least two whistle-blowers have raised concerns with one filing a complaint in April 2011 with the Hong Kong stock exchange and another coming forward to American authorities this year. Underscoring the worries a junior banker in Hong Kong resigned from JPMorgan in December 2011 writing in an email that ‰ÛÏI do not think my family is in a position to help you to the extent as others did: bring their family business to the firm.‰Û The  scrutiny of JPMorgan  which has not been accused of any wrongdoing could provide a template for federal authorities as they expand their investigation to include the hiring practices of at least five other Wall Street banks conducting business in China according to interviews with people briefed in the inquiry who were not authorized to speak publicly. Those investigations from the  Securities and Exchange Commission  which are at an early stage involve  Citigroup   Credit Suisse   Deutsche Bank   Goldman Sachs  and  Morgan Stanley . All five banks declined to comment. JPMorgan is cooperating with the government inquiries from the S.E.C. and the United States attorney‰Ûªs office in Brooklyn which are examining whether the bank improperly swapped job offers and consulting contracts for business with state-owned Chinese companies. China‰Ûªs economy is highly regulated and many of its biggest companies are state-controlled. There is no indication that executives at JPMorgan‰Ûªs headquarters in New York were aware of the hiring practices described in the documents. And authorities might ultimately conclude that the bank‰Ûªs hiring while aggressive did not cross a legal line. JPMorgan declined to comment. The S.E.C. and the prosecutors in Brooklyn also declined to comment. The breadth of the investigations underscore how pervasive the hiring practices may have become in China. For two decades Wall Street banks have sought out China‰Ûªs so-called princelings turning family and friends of senior officials into bank employees and consultants. The documents reviewed by The Times along with the interviews suggest that some executives at JPMorgan felt a need to scramble to compete with Wall Street rivals that already had footholds in China. JPMorgan may have adopted some of their hiring strategies ‰ÛÓ and even shared employees and consultants. Fullmark Consultants a firm that JPMorgan hired in 2006 to help improve its standing in China also did business with Credit Suisse according to interviews. Fullmark which received a $75000-a-month contract over two years from JPMorgan was  run by Wen Ruchun  the only daughter of  Wen Jiabao  who at the time was China‰Ûªs prime minister with ultimate responsibility over state-owned companies. In the contract with JPMorgan and other clients which is now at the center of the federal bribery investigation Ms. Wen used the alias ‰ÛÏLily Chang.‰Û The S.E.C. and prosecutors are building their investigation around the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act a 1977 law that makes it illegal for United States companies to exchange ‰ÛÏanything of value‰Û with foreign officials to win ‰ÛÏan improper advantage‰Û in obtaining business. Federal authorities have adopted a tougher stance in recent years taking aim at American companies suspected of acting with ‰ÛÏcorrupt intent‰Û or with an expectation of trading a job for government business. It is unclear whether JPMorgan ever reached an upfront agreement with Chinese government officials. And the records reviewed by The Times do not suggest that the employees were unqualified. According to documents and interviews with current and former employees JPMorgan created the ‰ÛÏSons and Daughters‰Û program in 2006 with the expectation that the hires would receive heightened scrutiny. But by 2009 the ‰ÛÏSons and Daughters‰Û program was putting the job candidates on the fast track to employment. The documents show that applicants from prominent Chinese families faced less stringent hiring standards ‰ÛÓ and fewer job interviews ‰ÛÓ than the average junior-level hire. The bank once proposed another program for ‰ÛÏfull-time referrals‰Û that would have offered the well-connected hires a one-year contract worth $70000 to $100000. The program internal documents said might offer ‰ÛÏdirectly attributable linkage to business opportunity.‰Û JPMorgan also briefly kept ‰ÛÏhistorical deal conversion‰Û spreadsheets according to interviews with people briefed on the investigation. In one column JPMorgan listed job candidates; in another the bank recorded its ‰ÛÏtrack record‰Û for winning business from companies tied to those candidates. Other spreadsheets listed well-connected hires and the revenue JPMorgan earned from deals with private and state-owned Chinese companies linked to those hires documents show. In discussions with authorities the people briefed on the investigation said JPMorgan has explained that it did not connect revenue to the ‰ÛÏSons and Daughters‰Û program. Instead the bank has said the spreadsheets were meant to assess whether JPMorgan bankers in hopes of securing full-time jobs for some interns in the program had exaggerated the revenue received from state-owned companies. The spreadsheets included about 30 employees with ties to state-owned companies or Communist Party officials including the daughter of the deputy minister of propaganda a relative of a Chinese financial regulator and the nephew of the executive chairman at Sinotruk which is part of a state-owned trucking enterprise. JPMorgan also tracked the revenue it received from private Asian companies that referred job candidates to the bank a practice that would not fall under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. One hire was connected to Fubon Financial Holding a financial services conglomerate in Taiwan that according to the spreadsheet produced 2009 revenue of $900000 for JPMorgan. JPMorgan bankers in Hong Kong coveted the business with Fubon. In an August 2010 email reviewed by The Times a JPMorgan banker in Hong Kong explained that the bank had ‰ÛÏpicked up a new mandate in Taiwan today‰Û but that holding onto the deal would depend on securing a job for someone related to a company executive. ‰ÛÏAll we have to do‰Û the banker said is secure the relative ‰ÛÏa full-time analyst job at JPM in N.Y.‰Û The problem another employee in Hong Kong acknowledged was that the candidate‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏnapping habit will be an eye-opening experience for our N.Y. colleagues.‰Û While the email appears to suggest a quid pro quo the message is unlikely to alarm federal authorities because it involves a private company rather than a state-owned enterprise. But the bank‰Ûªs hiring of Tang Xiaoning a onetime Goldman and Citigroup employee whose father is the chairman of the China Everbright Group appeared to encapsulate the spirit of the ‰ÛÏSons and Daughters‰Û program for state-owned clients. The father Tang Shuangning approached a JPMorgan executive in Hong Kong in March 2010 about a position for his son records and interviews show. The executive who led JPMorgan‰Ûªs China investment banking unit welcomed the request and urged his colleagues in an email a day later to discuss ‰ÛÏhow we can leverage more on this account going forward.‰Û But in an internal compliance form the executive played down the significance of hiring Mr. Tang documents show saying there was ‰ÛÏno expected benefit.‰Û By that point in March 2010 JPMorgan appeared to do little if any business with China Everbright according to securities filings and news reports. But shortly after Mr. Tang‰Ûªs father approached JPMorgan a China Everbright subsidiary hired the bank to advise on a $300 million private offering of shares according to interviews. And in 2011 after Mr. Tang worked at JPMorgan for several months China Everbright‰Ûªs banking subsidiary hired JPMorgan as one of several financial advisers on its decision to become a public company a deal that was delayed amid turmoil on the world‰Ûªs markets. About that time JPMorgan offered a second one-year contract to Mr. Tang who was prevented from having any role in working on China Everbright deals. Mr. Tang executives said at the time had received generally positive performance reviews. He also had previously earned a master‰Ûªs degree in international affairs from  Columbia University . While Mr. Tang worked at JPMorgan the assignments from his father‰Ûªs company continued to pile up for the bank. In 2012 China Everbright International a subsidiary focused on alternative energy businesses hired JPMorgan to advise on a $162 million sale of shares according to Standard & Poor‰Ûªs Capital IQ a research service. In May of that year as Mr. Tang‰Ûªs contract was expiring JPMorgan faced a turning point. But at the urging of the JPMorgan investment banking executive Mr. Tang received another extension. ‰ÛÏGiven where we are on China Everbright I think we may need another contract for Xiaoning‰Û the executive wrote. Zhang Rong the junior banker who resigned from JPMorgan in December 2011 also highlighted the bank‰Ûªs hiring strategy. On an overnight flight from Hong Kong to the United States Mr. Zhang drafted a resignation letter that lamented how ‰ÛÏAll of my efforts seemed meaningless to you and you tend to judge me solely on the relation part of me.‰Û Mr. Zhang said he was quitting because he could no longer ‰ÛÏlive under the shadow of my father.‰Û The father he indicated had ties to the China Post Group which runs the Chinese postal service and other subsidiaries. In a statement the China Post Group denied that Zhang Rong was connected to the company or its top executives. The company declined to provide further details. Mr. Zhang promised in the email that his father would still ‰ÛÏtry his best to coordinate the meeting‰Û between JPMorgan and China Post. And Mr. Zhang who sent the email just days before Christmas assured JPMorgan that he did not harbor any hard feelings. ‰ÛÏWish you and your family merry Xmas and happy New Year!!!‰Û David Barboza contributed reporting.

This week  the department dropped its opposition after the companies agreed to give up some space at a few airports åÛåÓ hardly sufficient to ensure the vigorous competition in the airline industry needed to keep fares down.         In agreeing to the merger the department seems to have forgotten the crucial arguments it made in its suit. It said that competition would decline significantly on more than 1000 routes where the two companies currently compete head-to-head. And it said that the new combined American Airlines would control 69 percent of the limited takeoff and landing slots at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington giving it a near-monopoly there.         Under the proposed deal which is subject to public comment and has to be approved by a federal judge the two airlines will divest 15 percent of the takeoff and landing slots they control at Reagan National Airport and 7 percent of the slots they control at La Guardia Airport in New York to low-cost airlines like JetBlue. This would give travelers at those airports more choice and possibly lower fares but the change may not be significant.         The combined airline would also have to give up two gates at Boston Logan International Miami International Chicago OåÛåªHare International Los Angeles International and Dallas Love Field. With the exception of Love Field where American has just two gates the two airlines control many gates at those airports and relinquishing two at each will not make a big difference.         These steps do virtually nothing to address the issue of reduced competition in dozens of other markets and on routes where the two airlines currently compete for customers. In some cities like Phoenix Charlotte and Philadelphia the merged airline will have such a dominant position that its competitors will have a very hard time challenging it.         The antitrust division asserts the settlement is better than blocking the merger because it gives new lower-cost airlines a chance to enter some airports by making gates or takeoff and landing slots available. The division assumes that the smaller airlines like JetBlue which has a much more limited network will ensure stronger price competition. But US Airways which has an extensive network and aggressive business tactics already offers lower fares than American in many markets.         Furthermore the agreement simply ignores the central concern the Justice Department expressed in its lawsuit: the four big airlines åÛåÓ United Delta Southwest and the merged American åÛåÓ will have an even greater incentive to raise fares and fees because consumers will have fewer choices.

It was a place of åÛåÏdark party barsåÛå and neon lights a åÛåÏfunny place/Something like a circus or a seweråÛå despite the åÛåÏnew buildings/Square tall and the sameåÛå åÛåÓ a place as distinctive as ChandleråÛåªs Los Angeles or BaudelaireåÛåªs Paris. He wrote about New York with a mix of journalistic observation and deeply felt emotion a poetåÛåªs tenderness and a bad boyåÛåªs street cred creating a soundtrack to the city that resonates decades after Times Square has been hosed down and scrubbed clean and the Village and SoHo and TriBeCa have been transformed from grungy bohemian haunts into destination stops on luxury real estate search engines.         (A public event  åÛåÏNew York: Lou Reed at Lincoln CenteråÛå  is scheduled for Thursday afternoon at the Paul Milstein Pool and Terrace at Lincoln Center near where Reed and his wife the musician and performance artist Laurie Anderson joined Occupy Wall Street protesters some two years ago.)         For some of Mr. ReedåÛåªs older fans his portraits of New York are like old black-and-white snapshots (or the monochrome covers of old New Directions paperbacks) summoning memories of a time when they were young and defiant and searching for some elusive something. For generations of younger fans too his gritty view of life on the edge and his primal uncompromising music remain an inspiration. He was åÛåÏan early calling card to New York and how to be an artiståÛå Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth told Rolling Stone magazine. åÛåÏHe was like the Empire State Building to me.åÛå         Mr. Reed was a pioneer on rockåÛåªs frontier with the avant-garde translating lessons he learned at Andy WarholåÛåªs Factory and the disruptive innovations of the Beat writers åÛåÓ Allen Ginsberg William S. Burroughs and Hubert Selby Jr. (åÛåÏLast Exit to BrooklynåÛå) åÛåÓ to the realm of popular music. He not only embraced their adversarial stance toward society and transgressive subject matter (in songs like åÛåÏStreet HassleåÛå and åÛåÏHeroinåÛå) but also developed his own version of their raw vernacular language while adding a physical third dimension with guitars and drums. His early songs for the Velvet Underground åÛåÓ delivered in his intimate conversational sing-speak åÛåÓ still sound so astonishingly inventive and new that itåÛåªs hard to remember they were written nearly half a century ago.         If Mr. Reed provided a literary bridge to the Beats (and through them back to the Modernists and the French åÛåÏdecadentsåÛå Rimbaud and Verlaine and even Poe the subject of his 2003 project åÛåÏThe RavenåÛå) he also created a bridge forward to punk and to glam indie new wave and noise rock. He would become a formative influence on musicians like Talking Heads Patti Smith Roxy Music R.E.M. the Sex Pistols Sonic Youth the Strokes Pixies and Antony and the Johnsons. As his friend the artist Clifford Ross observed åÛåÏLou was the great transmitteråÛå åÛåÓ of ideas language and innovation.         What gave Mr. Reed such a broad artistic wingspan was the extraordinary emotional and sonic range of his work: his access to both the sunlit and darkly shadowed parts of his psyche his magpieåÛåªs love of so many genres of music and his willful determination to continually experiment. His music from album to album (sometimes from track to track) often seemed deliberately to subvert expectations. His 1972 album åÛåÏTransformeråÛå åÛåÓ which mixed rough street reportage with playful trippy musings in classics like åÛåÏWalk on the Wild SideåÛå åÛåÏPerfect DayåÛå and åÛåÏSatellite of LoveåÛå åÛåÓ was followed by his dark ambitious song cycle åÛåÏBerlinåÛå and a few years later by the deliberately difficult åÛåÏMetal Machine MusicåÛå (1975) a howling hour-plus-long barrage of feedback and electronic noise.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs not that he didnåÛåªt care what people thoughtåÛå his longtime producer and collaborator Hal Willner said last week. åÛåÏHe cared. But it wasnåÛåªt going to change what he did.åÛå

There was nothing I could do.         But in a city where åÛåÏtrain trafficåÛå that villain of automated subway announcements can be too faceless a culprit most riders know nothing of the system to officially assign blame with a simple note.         Since June 2010 the  Metropolitan Transportation Authority  has given more than 250000 such notes titled Subway Delay Verification to riders determining whether their trains had in fact come in behind schedule or if perhaps the agency had been unjustly scapegoated by a harried commuter.         Passengers  are asked to provide  information like their subway line and the times and locations of their entries and exits. And then maybe hours later maybe days the authority returns with its judgment åÛåÓ the transit equivalent of a doctoråÛåªs note if a bit more bewildering.         åÛåÏThere was a disruption in service specifically signal trouble sick customer brakes in emergency and track circuit failure which caused massive service delays reroutes and/or trains to be discharged on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 A B C D F J L M N Q and R linesåÛå one recent response read in part. åÛåÏAs a result any one delay lasted up to 82 minutes.åÛå         Forms to be presented eventually to bosses or clients have been solicited by employees of the Museum of Modern Art and the New York Police Department medical trainees who sleep in and actresses with appointments far across town.         The Swedish Institute in Chelsea  has advised  massage therapists to bookmark the delay verification page reminding them as one administrator said in a recent interview that punctuality åÛåÓ or failing that proof of good intentions åÛåÓ was critical to succeeding in an industry powered by restless New Yorkers in robes.         Even the cityåÛåªs young educational elite assured that lateness will beget punishment have petitioned school staffs to accept the authorityåÛåªs certificates as exculpatory.         åÛåÏYou know menåÛå said Mary Brockmeyer an administrative aide at Regis High School an all-boys school on the Upper East Side.         Though a version of the program has existed for decades enlisted chiefly by municipal workers who were paid according to a punched clock the authority said that requests had nearly tripled since the service first became available online in 2010. In October when over 156 million subway trips were taken according to preliminary agency data the authority issued more than 8200 responses to riders who asked for the documentation.         åÛåÏWeåÛåªd rather be at 100 percent on-time performanceåÛå said Paul Fleuranges the authorityåÛåªs senior director of corporate and internal communications. åÛåÏBut nobodyåÛåªs perfect.åÛå         A survey of other major transit networks suggests that the authority is uniquely dedicated to charting its imperfections. Officials in Boston Chicago and Washington said their systems offered no such service online though riders can ask for a delay to be confirmed through customer service channels.         Passengers on the London Underground are refunded according to the systemåÛåªs website if delays exceed 15 minutes åÛåÏfor reasons within our control.åÛå         Perhaps only the transit minds of Japan  where a trainåÛåªs punctuality is often treated as a given  can supplement the New York authorityåÛåªs zeal for detail with a dash of genuine guilt. Delay certificates issued at ticket gates for the Tokyo Metro have been known to include messages of apology.         Still many New Yorkers seem to have used the notices to their advantage. Marcus Greer who travels from South Jamaica Queens to his job as a security guard in Midtown said the service had helped keep punctuality-related blemishes off his permanent file. Workers who accrue too many can be fired he said.         åÛåÏBefore the system was in place they would give you a write-up right off the batåÛå he said. åÛåÏEven if you were late by the train it just goes in your folder.åÛå         In recent years Mr. Greer said the notices have served a dual purpose: absolving guards on particular mornings åÛåÓ typically involving the E and No. 6 trains in his case åÛåÓ and proving to supervisors that employees probably should have been taken at their word all along.         åÛåÏYou have the proofåÛå he said. åÛåÏThat means they can trust you.åÛå

The dancer Joy Womack  moved to Moscow on her own at the age of 15  in 2009 to attend the Bolshoi school which is formally known as the Moscow State Academy of Choreography. It was established in 1773 and its alumni include some of the most illustrious dancers in the history of ballet.         Ms. WomackåÛåªs allegations which she described in a telephone interview on Thursday evening were first reported by the Russian news site Izvestia and they are the latest controversy to engulf the Bolshoi which has been battered by scandal this year. A former principal dancer Pavel V. Dmitrichenko is  on trial  in Moscow on charges that he arranged an  acid attack  in January that nearly blinded Sergei Filin the companyåÛåªs artistic director.         In the interview Ms. Womack said she was heartbroken to be leaving the Bolshoi. At the same time she described a deeply troubled organization in which casting decisions were based not only on talent but also on payoffs and personal relationships. She would not confirm reports that she was moving to the Kremlin Ballet.         The Bolshoi TheateråÛåªs general director Vladimir Urin said in a statement on Wednesday that officials were prepared to cooperate with any law enforcement investigation and he challenged Ms. Womack to file a complaint something she has said she will not do.         åÛåÏAs for accusations of corruption among ballet officialsåÛå Mr. Urin said åÛåÏJoy Womack should advocate her position legally.åÛå         Ms. Womack has declined to name the Bolshoi official who said a $10000 payment would get her a soloist role. She said the figure was mentioned after she had repeatedly pressed managers about her desire for prominent roles. Since her graduation she was offered few chances to perform she said.         åÛåÏÌâåÊåÛå÷DonåÛåªt you understand that you are an American?åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå Ms. Womack said she was told at one point. åÛåÏÌâåÊåÛå÷You have to be smarter about this. You have to find out who you have to pay.åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå         When a Bolshoi official mentioned the $10000 figure Ms. Womack said åÛåÏthat was a starting bargaining point.åÛå She added åÛåÏItåÛåªs not a secret that there are many dancers who have given presents.åÛå         Allegations of favoritism and impropriety at the Bolshoi also arose in the acid attack trial when Mr. Dmitrichenko accused Mr. Filin who is married of using his influence to initiate romantic relationships with Bolshoi ballerinas. He denied the accusation.         Ms. Womack said that since she came forward she had been åÛåÏattacked by fellow dancers who are very scaredåÛå and criticized by some Bolshoi officials who said her dancing was not good enough. But she said she had only praise for Bolshoi teachers and artists: åÛåÏThey really are the best in the world.åÛå         She said she had encountered bureaucratic difficulties with the Bolshoi from the start including problems obtaining a work visa. Ms. Womack said she repeatedly asked for the åÛåÏstateåÛå contract Russian dancers normally get from the theater a government-run institution. Instead she got a series of short-term contracts she said explaining that often she was not paid and when she was it was in cash. åÛåÏThe way everything went down at this theater was not very professionalåÛå she said. åÛåÏIt was kind of shady.åÛå         But Ms. Womack said her main demand was for prominent roles.         åÛåÏThe problem is that I wasnåÛåªt even being put into the corps de balletåÛå she said. åÛåÏI had spent a year waiting.åÛå         Ms. Womack said that in September she signed a six-month contract with a salary of 198000 rubles just over $6000 and was told 30 percent would be deducted for income tax leaving about $700 a month in a city rated as one of the worldåÛåªs most expensive.         The Bolshoi training also came at a high price. During her studies Ms. Womack was nearly forced to quit because her family was struggling to pay the $18000-a-year tuition. (Russians study there for free.) At another point a donor from her church saved her career by paying for surgery she needed for a foot injury.         In the interview Ms. Womack said the public break with the Bolshoi had dashed her dreams.         åÛåÏInstead I am being seen as the whistle-bloweråÛå she said.

LetåÛåªs start here: IsnåÛåªt there a tradition of close-knit family membersåÛåª taking care not to wound one another? Is there not value in that?         From the moment that Liz decided from the perch of her longtime home in the Virginia suburbs of Washington to act the part of an honest-to-goodness Wyoming resident and challenge an incumbent senator (and family  friend ) from that state she must have known that the issue of same-sex marriage would come up. It is after all a prominent thread in the news. ItåÛåªs also a prominent thread in stories about her family given that her father Dick bucked his party to become an  early Republican supporter  of same-sex marriage and given that her lone sibling Mary has a female spouse.         She must also have entertained speaking out against it because thatåÛåªs what she ended up doing on Sunday on  Fox News  saying that she believed åÛåÏin the traditional definition of marriage.åÛå And she must have foreseen that this would pain Mary who was married last year and whose two children are being brought up with the understanding that their family has the same dignity as any other.         But she plunged forward anyway disregarding the inevitable discord.  As Jonathan Martin reported  in The Times Liz and Mary arenåÛåªt speaking to each other now and thereåÛåªs a long shadow over the CheneysåÛåª holiday get-togethers.         Is any political office worth that? Would victory redeem the public message that Liz just sent to her niece and nephew? IåÛåªm imagining her awkwardness the next time that she goes to hug or kiss them (and IåÛåªm assuming that sheåÛåªs a hugger or kisser which may be a leap). If thereåÛåªs not a knot in her stomach then thereåÛåªs nothing at all in her heart.         Having a lesbian sister doesnåÛåªt compel her to support marriage equality. Having a gay relative doesnåÛåªt compel anyone to. There are earnest divisions here often driven by deep-seated religious convictions.         But LizåÛåªs decision to chart a course and publicize a view bound to offend her sister is entirely volitional. ItåÛåªs also entirely different from airing other ideological disagreements within families. Conflicting views on abortion or the death penalty donåÛåªt challenge the very structure and foundation of a loved oneåÛåªs home. Questioning the validity of a marriage does. YouåÛåªre not saying that you part with the way someone thinks. YouåÛåªre saying that you have qualms with who they are and this is a statement åÛåÓ a sentiment åÛåÓ you can keep to yourself. Even once Liz had elected to run she could have chosen to say that the issue of gay marriage wasnåÛåªt going to be part of her campaign.         Is she even being genuine in her opposition? In a  2009 interview  about gay marriage on MSNBC she said that åÛåÏfreedom means freedom for everybody.åÛå On Monday I talked with three people who worked with her in the Bush administration and all were very surprised by her current stance. TheyåÛåªd had the strong impression that she favored same-sex marriage.         Perhaps Mary and her wife Heather Poe did as well because Poe wrote this on Facebook after LizåÛåªs appearance on Fox News: åÛåÏLiz has been a guest in our home has spent time and shared holidays with our children and when Mary and I got married in 2012 åÛåÓ she didnåÛåªt hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us.åÛå         Happy back then self-serving and seemingly cowardly now. This feels to me like a political maneuver tailored to a conservative electorate and an unnecessary maneuver at that with the risk of making her seem inauthentic and uncharitable to Wyoming voters whoåÛåªve had more than a decade to absorb her dadåÛåªs socially moderate views. Gay marriage wonåÛåªt be those votersåÛåª primary secondary or tertiary issue anyway.         In a  statement released Monday  Dick and Lynne Cheney insisted that Liz had åÛåÏalways believed in the traditional definition of marriage.åÛå I suppose thatåÛåªs the politically prudent tack at this point but now the CheneysåÛåª support for gay marriage so moving over the years is buried beneath a family feud. Their statement paid less attention to Mary whoåÛåªs not running for anything not carrying her parentsåÛåª ambitions into a new era.         One word stood out. They said that Liz had shown Mary åÛåÏcompassion.åÛå This echoed a statement of LizåÛåªs own in which she noted that she had åÛåÏalways tried to be compassionateåÛå toward Mary and her family. What a curious vocabulary. It was as if they were all talking about some charity case.         I hope the Cheneys find their way out of this. ItåÛåªs an ugly spot that Liz in all her compassion has put them in.

The veteran Merrill Newman 85 of Palo Alto Calif. who has been held since Oct. 26 appeared on the  video  dressed in casual Western clothes and wearing glasses as he read excerpts from an  apology  written on several sheets of white paper. The text contained several awkward English constructions and grammatical errors.         In the apology Mr. Newman said he was an adviser for the Kuwol Unit of the United Nations Korea Sixth Partisan Regiment which served with the Intelligence Bureau of the Far East Command.         A person familiar with Mr. NewmanåÛåªs military record and his current situation in captivity in North Korea said that Mr. Newman served as an adviser in that unit in 1953 before the armistice. The unit operated behind the lines in North Korea but Mr. Newman conducted his duties as an adviser on Chodo an island off the west coast of what is now North Korea the person said. In the beginning of the video Mr. Newman mentioned Chodo as the place where he was stationed. The person speaking about Mr. NewmanåÛåªs situation declined to be identified because of the delicacy of the case.         The Swedish ambassador visited Mr. Newman on Saturday and told his family that he was in good health and being treated well according to a statement from the family. The United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea and has been dealing with Mr. NewmanåÛåªs situation through the Swedish Embassy which represents its interests in the North.         åÛåÏOur focus now is on getting him home quickly to join his loved ones who miss him deeplyåÛå the statement said. åÛåÏWe are asking that the D.P.R.K. authorities take into account his health and his age and as an act of humanitarian compassion allow him to depart immediately for home.åÛå The Democratic PeopleåÛåªs Republic of Korea or D.P.R.K. is North KoreaåÛåªs official name.         In the apology Mr. Newman describes how he wanted to meet åÛåÏsurviving soldiers and pray for the souls of the dead soldiersåÛå from the unit he worked with. If he met any surviving soldiers he planned to put them in touch with members of the Kuwol Partisan Comrades-in-Arms Association who had escaped to South Korea the apology said.         An email from Mr. Newman to friends in South Korea telling them of his impending trip to North Korea and his hopes of meeting with relatives of the partisan group is embedded in the video of the apology.         Mr. Newman said in the apology the text of which was released by the state-run Korean Central News Agency that he had asked his tour guide to look for families and relatives of the Comrades-in-Arms group which is described in the apology as åÛåÏan anti-Communist strategic plot organization.åÛå         In a  statement  also released by the Korean news agency that accompanied the apology North Korea characterized Mr. NewmanåÛåªs activities during the tour as åÛåÏtrying to look for spies and terrorists who conducted espionage and subversive activityåÛå and to åÛåÏconnect themåÛå to an anti-North Korean organization. It charged that Mr. Newman was åÛåÏslanderingåÛå North Korea and had åÛåÏperpetrated acts of infringing upon the dignity and sovereigntyåÛå of the country. The statement also referred to Mr. NewmanåÛåªs wartime activities.         åÛåÏAs I killed so many civilians and K.P.A. soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the D.P.R.K. during the Korean War I committed indelible offensive acts against the D.P.R.K. government and Korean peopleåÛå the apology said.         Col. Ben S. Malcom who commanded a unit of about 800 North Korean anti-Communist partisans during the war said American soldiers commanded and advised more than 20 partisan units that did everything from raiding North Korean military redoubts to counterfeiting North Korean currency robbing banks and stealing oxen.         åÛåÏWe were the people who were leading the North Korean guerrilla forcesåÛå against the North Korean Army said Colonel Malcom 84. åÛåÏThatåÛåªs probably the reason they are holding him at the present timeåÛå he said of Mr. Newman. Speaking Saturday from his home in Atlanta Colonel Malcom said that given the partisan fightersåÛåª destructiveness he was not surprised at North KoreaåÛåªs treatment of Mr. Newman.         åÛåÏI wouldnåÛåªt even consider going into North KoreaåÛå he said.

That was my job as a civil rights lawyer and at that time we had a rogue police force that refused civilian control rejected court orders abused people of color and acted with terrifying impunity.         It was three months since William J. Bratton had been hired to fix the disgraced Los Angeles Police Department after a disastrous decade that had started with the beating of Rodney G. King setting off the deadliest race riot in recent American history and ended with revelations about a gangster-cop ring that had planted evidence stolen drugs and attempted murder. The L.A.P.D. looked to many more like the Mafia than the police more stop-and-shoot than stop-and-frisk.         Mr. Bratton laughed at my opening salvo and said that I should shelve my complaint and come help him at the L.A.P.D. That I soon realized was typical of how Bill Bratton works.          Last week New York CityåÛåªs mayor-elect Bill de Blasio announced  that Mr. Bratton would be its new police commissioner replacing Raymond W. Kelly. Mr. Kelly and the departing mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had staunchly defended the New York Police DepartmentåÛåªs controversial stop-and-frisk tactic crediting it with reducing crime in the city. This led to doom-laden predictions from some quarters that the de Blasio administration would herald a return to the rampant crime of the 1970s and åÛåª80s.         The mayor-electåÛåªs choice of Mr. Bratton who has championed the åÛåÏbroken windowsåÛå approach of concentrating police resources on problem neighborhoods is widely seen as an attempt to calm New YorkersåÛåª nerves about crime. But Mr. Bratton has also pledged to reform stop-and-frisk and improve relations between the Police Department and minority residents. Can he do both?         Back in 2002 minority Los Angeles did not want Mr. Bratton åÛåÓ a chief who had advocated more police officers in minority areas. To my mind too the L.A.P.D. was too hostile to outsiders for the new commissioner to succeed. I doubted whether Moses with his tablets could pull it off never mind a cop with a thick Boston accent and quick temper. But I had underestimated his will and ability.         To the horror of the L.A.P.D. brass and my liberal colleagues I went ahead and joined the new chief at police headquarters at Parker Center. I parked my Prius next to his CrownÌâåÊVictoria and set about the tasks of helping select agents of change demoting the troglodytes and rewriting the training manual. The traitor had infiltrated the Praetorian Guard!         The L.A.P.D. was then under a federal court order åÛåÓ the consent decree åÛåÓ as a result of civil rights violations.  Mr. Bratton also hired Gerald Chaleff  a criminal defense lawyer (another åÛåÏtraitoråÛå) to head a new bureau to enforce compliance. This was key to Mr. BrattonåÛåªs vision of community trust policing.         The chiefåÛåªs goal was to achieve steep reductions in crime using CompStat the statistical system that compiles crime data to pinpoint hot spots and divert resources to problem areas and at the same time radically improve how officers treated black and brown residents. Mr. Bratton went into the black community and didnåÛåªt leave. He courted black leaders attended church and community meetings and bonded with as many African-Americans up and down the social ladder as he could.         Mr. Bratton slowly broke down the hostility from the black community and once crime began dropping he won its backing and eventual admiration.  By 2009 Mr. Bratton had  an approval rating of 66 percent; the police departmentåÛåªs was even higher including among Latinos and African-Americans.         There is still work to do in Los Angeles but Mr. Bratton did what heåÛåªd promised: He saw that the L.A.P.D. complied with the consent decree had restored the basic compact that officers would respect protect and serve even poor minorities and had reduced crime. New York can expect a similar approach but it faces a different set of challenges. The N.Y.P.D. is much larger than the L.A.P.D. and more decentralized. Reforming the Police Department after more than a decade during which post-9/11 concerns about public safety gave it carte blanche presents a tough challenge.         After the surveillance controversy and the stop-and-frisk epidemic trust is clearly an issue for New YorkåÛåªs Muslims and for communities of color. We can expect Mr. Bratton to do the outreach work to rebuild relationships. But first he must win the trust of his own officers so that they understand how reforming stop-and-frisk will win minority community help in fighting crime.         He will need to retrain officers to become part of the community so that providing intelligence on crime åÛåÓ so necessary for true public safety åÛåÓ becomes seamless and constitutional. In Los Angeles Mr. Bratton had the consent decree to leverage change; in New York he has no such tool åÛåÓ yet. And he has corruption such as the ticket-fixing scandal to tackle that he did not in Los Angeles.         After seven years of working with Mr. Bratton I am sure that he is the best chief for the challenges facing the cityåÛåªs cops. He will reform stop-and-frisk reinstate fair dealings with minorities and aggressively pursue effective crime fighting. The best thing about Mr. Bratton is that despite the ego he listens and learns from everyone åÛåÓ the mayor or a gang member. If I had to bet on anyone reducing crime in New York IåÛåªd put my money on Bill Bratton every time.        
1.0,4.71,5.59019802,7.01,1292.155,0.350157729,1588.5629999999999,29.0,1226.9189999999999,627.0,1430.9589999999998,22.0,For four decades Chicagoans have been able to one-up New Yorkers on at least one measure: The City of the Big Shoulders had the tallest building in the United States.         But as of Tuesday that crown is moving east. One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan  has officially been ruled  to be taller than the Willis Tower in Chicago. That judgment came from the primary arbiter of structural stature the  Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat .         New YorkåÛåªs tallest building was deemed taller even though it has six fewer floors and its roof is more than 100 feet lower than the top side of the Willis Tower. (Formerly known as the Sears Tower the Chicago building captured the title in the 1970s from the twin towers.)         How can that be?         It all depends on what the definition of an antenna is.         Both buildings have long masts poking skyward from their roofs. But those on the 1451-foot Willis Tower are considered antennas which the council does not count in calculating the height of a building.         The  408-foot long mast  on 1 World Trade Center on the other hand is more than just a means of improving radio signals its developers argued. They called it a spire and insisted it was a critical and permanent element of the architectsåÛåª overall design.         When 25 members of the councilåÛåªs height committee met in Chicago on Friday they heard the spire argument from the chief architect David Childs of the firm Skidmore Owings & Merrill and representatives of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which developed the trade center.         The New York contingent said the spire had always been part of the plan to achieve the symbolic height of 1776 feet.         The committee members unanimously agreed that the spire should be counted said Timothy Johnson the councilåÛåªs chairman and a partner in NBBJ a design firm.         åÛåÏThe building is in fact 1776 feetåÛå Mr. Johnson said. åÛåÏWe donåÛåªt believe the spire will ever be removed.åÛå         The Port Authority issued a joint statement with the architects and the Durst Organization which is managing the building and recruiting tenants. åÛåÏThis iconic building represents the resilience of America and todayåÛåªs decision recognizes 1 World Trade CenteråÛåªs rightful place in historyåÛå the statement said.         Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago was unmoved.         åÛåÏIf it looks like an antenna acts like an antenna then it is an antennaåÛå Mr. Emanuel said after the decision was announced. åÛåÏAt the Willis Tower you have a panoramic view that is unmatched. You canåÛåªt get a view like that from an antenna.åÛå         Mr. EmanuelåÛåªs tone reflects the pride Chicagoans take in their cityåÛåªs architecture and its status as the home of the countryåÛåªs first åÛåÏskyscraperåÛå the 10-story Home Insurance Building.         Carol Willis an architectural historian and founder of the Skyscraper Museum in Manhattan said there were various ways to measure the size of a building beyond its height. åÛåÏIn the endåÛå Ms. Willis said åÛåÏbuildings are about more than one dimension. ItåÛåªs about height floor plans office space location and rent.åÛå         She pointed out that the Empire State Building was about 200 feet taller than another former record-holder the Chrysler Building and also had twice as much office space as the Chrysler Building and the Bank of Manhattan Building at 40 Wall Street combined.         Walter Chrysler came up with a spire of his own to gain the edge in a similar rivalry in the late 1920s. To beat the 927-foot height of 40 Wall Street he secretly had a 125-foot spire assembled inside the crown of the Chrysler Building raising it to 1046 feet.         The architects for 40 Wall Street countered that their building had the highest usable floor.         Now Chicagoans can say the same about the Willis Tower.

The recipient of his warm words former Mayor David N. Dinkins did not exactly return the favor.         In an unscripted and cringe-inducing moment of political candor Mr. Dinkins opined before a crowd of journalists and academics at Columbia University that Mr. de Blasio should consider a different approach to funding an expansion of prekindergarten programs throwing a wrench into what was meant to be a carefully choreographed day of municipal theater.         Citing skepticism in Albany Mr. Dinkins suggested that Mr. de Blasio could turn to a tax on suburban commuters rather than the  tax-the-rich plan  that became a centerpiece of his mayoral campaign.         åÛåÏI think we might have more success with the other oneåÛå Mr. Dinkins said referring to his commuter plan a comment that prompted applause from some members of the audience.         Onstage Mr. de Blasio kept a mirthless smile on his face. åÛåÏI take your point to heartåÛå he said.         For Mr. de Blasio a careful political orchestrator it was an awkward unwelcome ad-lib from a man whom moments before he had effusively praised even joking that Mr. Dinkins deserved credit for his marriage since he met his wife Chirlane McCray while both were serving in the former mayoråÛåªs administration.         But it also served as an unusually public display of the skepticism that Mr. de Blasio must now overcome as he rolls out an aggressive campaign to enact the education policy that he views as  the top legislative priority  åÛåÓ and a key political benchmark åÛåÓ of his first year in City Hall.         Responding to Mr. Dinkins Mr. de Blasio insisted that raising taxes on the rich was the åÛåÏright path and the attainable pathåÛå to funding prekindergarten classes noting that Mr. Dinkins himself had persuaded the State Legislature to approve a tax increase that allowed the city to hire more police officers. (Mr. DinkinsåÛåªs proposal raised taxes on a broad swath of New Yorkers not just wealthy ones.)         After his speech the keynote address of an education conference Mr. de Blasio acknowledged to reporters that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo who would have to sign his plan into law had signaled a desire to reduce taxes in the state adding åÛåÏI respect that.åÛå         But Mr. de Blasio returned several times to the enormous margin of victory he enjoyed on Election Day against his Republican opponent saying his win represented åÛåÏa clear mandateåÛå by the public for his policy plans.         åÛåÏIåÛåªm not going to bargain against myselfåÛå Mr. de Blasio said. åÛåÏThe plan IåÛåªve put forward is the best route both governmentally and politically to get it done.åÛå         Mr. de Blasio said he would move swiftly to galvanize public support for his proposal. He said he planned to appoint a åÛåÏworking groupåÛå to help him navigate the policy minutiae and the legislative legerdemain necessary to guide the bill through Albany.         åÛåÏIåÛåªm convinced this is the best way to get this doneåÛå Mr. de Blasio said.         Mr. de Blasio shrugged off a question about Mr. DinkinsåÛåªs comments saying he had been hearing positive feedback about his plans from many civic leaders.         Still in a sign of heightened sensitivity two of Mr. de BlasioåÛåªs top press aides hovered warily as Mr. Dinkins met with reporters.         The former mayor sporting his usual bow tie said he had simply wanted to raise an alternative plan given the LegislatureåÛåªs usual intransigence.         åÛåÏSo many people dislike the notion of taxing the rich for the poor. I donåÛåªt but many doåÛå Mr. Dinkins said.         He explained that the public forum had seemed an obvious place to raise the issue. åÛåÏI never mentioned it before to him directlyåÛå Mr. Dinkins said åÛåÏbut it seemed like such an excellent opportunity given all of the media there.åÛå

Stocks consolidated some of their gains of the last two days as caution also ticked-up before the Federal Reserve's meeting next week amid talk of a tentative scaling-back of its stimulus from some of its policymakers.         After a subdued day for Asian stock markets Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 and Britain's FTSE 100 all opened little changed to get the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index off to a steady start.         Investors were poised for a busy day of data on some of the countries still struggling in the euro zone as well as some interesting money market operations at the ECB where liquidity levels are now the tightest in two years.         Slightly weaker-than-expected French industrial production got things off to a shaky start though equivalent data from Italy was better ahead of its final third quarter GDP number later at 1000 GMT.         France's disappointing figures did little to rattle the strong euro or the region's main bond markets as they continued to add to the minor gains of recent days. <GVD/EUR>         The euro at $1.3737 was at its highest level since late October versus the dollar and a five-year high of 142.19 yen as anticipation of further moves from Tokyo to boost growth kept the Japanese currency on the back foot.         ""It is hard to say the euro will weaken unless the ECB does something"" said Laurent Fransolet an interest rate strategist at Barclays in London.         ""The bar for them (to carry out  quantitative easing  or other types of aggressive easing measures) is quite a bit higher compared to the Fed or Bank of England.""         Last week after the ECB kept rates on hold the bank's head Mario Draghi said he was satisfied with goings-on in the money market and on Monday one of the bank's other top policymakers Yves Mersch stressed the hurdles to further aggressive easing measures.         One factor that has been driving the euro higher is that in sharp contrast to the Fed the ECB's balance sheet has shrunk 8 percent this year as banks have started paying back the 1 trillion euros they took at the peak of the euro crisis.         The amount of excess ECB cash that has long kept bank-to-bank borrowing rates pinned down is now at its lowest level since late 2011.         Analysts will be watching closely to see exactly how tight things have got later when the ECB attempts to get banks to park cash with it to offset its controversial sovereign bond purchases of the past.         GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT         Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields were steady at 2.8243 in early European trade and Wall Street was expected to inch higher when it resumes later after the S&P 500 drifted to another record high on Monday.         In Asia MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.1 percent though the session's moves were small as trading was cautious before next week's U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.         The Nikkei stock average gave up 0.3 percent pulling back from a one-week high as investors booked gains before the year-end though Japan's benchmark was still on track for its best yearly performance since 1972.         A spate of data released by China late in the session reassured investors worried that the world's second-largest economy might be slowing. Industrial output was slightly shy of market expectations but retail sales cheered.         ""It's hard to see this causing any anxiety to the authorities or causing them to see the need for policy change"" Tim Condon economist at ING in Singapore said about the Chinese data.         FED FOCUS         Signs of improvement in the global economy have provided fitful support to riskier assets in recent weeks as markets have been buffeted by uncertainty over the Fed's tapering timeline.         A Reuters poll showed on Monday showed it was still expected to start the process in March but some economists now say that it might do so as early as this month.         Several Fed officials also lent credence to the idea that a tentative reduction was on the near-term horizon on Monday.         St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the bank could slightly reduce its monthly bond purchases this month while Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher also said tapering should start next week.         On the commodities front Brent oil was back up to $110 a barrel though U.S. crude edged up to $97.79 per barrel on expectations of a second weekly drop in U.S. crude inventories.         Spot gold hovered to $1240 an ounce after gaining over the last two sessions on short-covering technical selling and some fund-buying.         Copper was steady at $7137.25 a tonne near a one-month high as steady consumer buying from China put a floor under prices.

The Weinstein Company founded eight years ago by Mr. Weinstein and his brother Bob is making a surge into TV production that will soon test whether it can extend its success in film to the world of television.         By next year the company åÛåÓ known for movies like this yearåÛåªs prize contender åÛåÏLee DanielsåÛåª The ButleråÛå along with some reality television including åÛåÏProject RunwayåÛå and scattered fashion and media ventures åÛåÓ will be at work on more than a half-dozen new scripted series while expanding its unscripted TV business.         The heavy investment in the production and sale of series signals a strategic shift that is meant to anchor Weinstein a midsize independent studio almost equally in television and film. It mirrors changes occurring elsewhere in Hollywood: Last week for instance the much larger Sony Pictures Entertainment said it would  trim its film slate  while building up TV.         åÛåÏThe way to add stability to the company is to be in the television businessåÛå Harvey Weinstein said in an interview by phone last week. Mr. Weinstein who spoke jointly with the companyåÛåªs president David Glasser said his goal was to create a television operation åÛåÏas powerful as the theatrical division.åÛå         The planned series will include a 10-episode detective drama set in ancient Egypt called åÛåÏBook of the DeadåÛå in a deal that involves a British partnership and prospective sales in the United States and åÛåÏ10 CommandmentsåÛå a 10-episode series being produced for the Tribune CompanyåÛåªs WGN America. In that film directors like Lee Daniels Madonna Ryan Coogler and Wes Craven might each oversee an episode based on one of the commandments handed to Moses.         Other planned shows are åÛåÏMarco PoloåÛå a martial arts-filled adventure series from the executive producer John Fusco for Netflix; åÛåÏWar and PeaceåÛå a 14-episode retelling of TolstoyåÛåªs Napoleonic war novel in association with the BBC; åÛåÏStan and OllieåÛå about the later days of the Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy comedy team also for the BBC and possible sale here; and an åÛåÏEntourageåÛå-like comic series based loosely on the adventures of the celebrity chef Michael Chiarello.         The company has also acquired rights to åÛåÏPeaky BlindersåÛå a British crime series and åÛåÏGomorrahåÛå an Italian mob drama both of which are being offered for sale in the United States.         Those scripted shows join a growing roster of reality projects including åÛåÏConcrete KingsåÛå about the construction business and åÛåÏRodeo GirlsåÛå about female rodeo competitors both for A&E; and åÛåÏUnder the GunnåÛå a spinoff of the companyåÛåªs continuing åÛåÏProject RunwayåÛå series on Lifetime.         Over all the television operation åÛåÓ headed by Meryl Poster a former film producer åÛåÓ is counting on what Weinstein associates describe as åÛåÏthe Harvey factoråÛå and åÛåÏthe Weinstein DNA.åÛå Those have something to do with the brothersåÛåª talent relationships and Harvey WeinsteinåÛåªs undeniable flair for promotion. (His latest coup was landing an official White House screening for åÛåÏMandela: Long Walk to FreedomåÛå even as administration officials said  they planned to stop dabbling  in HollywoodåÛåªs Oscar campaigns.)         Though no guarantee of success the combination is enough to command attention.         åÛåÏWould I be surprised in the coming years if Harvey brought something to us that makes sense for HBO? Not in the leaståÛå said Richard Plepler chief executive of HBO. The TV push is backed by money from a freshly negotiated $370 million in available lending from an arrangement with Union Bank. About $150 million of that is earmarked for television Mr. Glasser said.         Mr. Weinstein acknowledged that in its early years his company stumbled in a first round of expansion that aimed to make it less a studio than  a mini-media conglomerate . åÛåÏWe had a rough start to say the leaståÛå he said.         Early misadventures included the brief ownership of a controlling stake in the social network ASmallWorld and the acquisition of a majority stake in Genius a home video distribution company that flopped. Once valued at $400 million the Genius holding dwindled in value as the DVD market collapsed and  was off-loaded  in 2009.         Mr. Weinstein said James L. Dolan a friend and the chief executive of Cablevision Systems had been particularly forceful in urging him to focus on television. With its relatively quick pacing and potential for long-running hits TV can be a counterweight to the jagged economics of film where even a success like åÛåÏThe KingåÛåªs SpeechåÛå åÛåÓ a Weinstein-distributed Oscar winner in 2011 åÛåÓ may fade without creating spinoffs and sequels.         In an email Harold Vogel an entertainment industry analyst said the companyåÛåªs foray into television could make sense.         åÛåÏIt is a lot smarter for them to move toward TV scripted production than to pursue cable networks publishing games and other such off-the-reservation ventures as theyåÛåªve done in the paståÛå Mr. Vogel wrote.         But TV he pointed out can be as capital-hungry as movies åÛåÓ the åÛåÏMarco PoloåÛå series for instance will cost about $90 million to produce. And despite the success of say Jerry Bruckheimer who years ago shifted from film to television there is no guarantee that movie-world skills will matter in a different medium.         åÛåÏThe amply demonstrated Weinstein expertise is in spotting one-off films already made and in film distribution and marketingåÛå Mr. Vogel wrote. åÛåÏIn TV production IåÛåªd not be certain that any of these skills are readily transferable.åÛå         Bob Weinstein interviewed separately from his brother said he was developing original projects that would be in tune with his horror- and action-oriented Dimension brand along with several shows based on movies he has overseen for the company. He is preparing a pilot based on the åÛåÏScreamåÛå films for MTV for instance and developing a proposed 10-part series with Frank Darabont based on DimensionåÛåªs film version of Stephen KingåÛåªs åÛåÏThe Mist.åÛå         Mr. Weinstein said he was also hoping to quickly follow the August release of the film åÛåÏSin City: A Dame to Kill ForåÛå directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez with a åÛåÏSin CityåÛå television series from Mr. Miller and Mr. Rodriguez.         Asked whether some of his past and present Oscar contenders might lead to future television shows Harvey Weinstein said he saw potential for instance in åÛåÏSilver Linings PlaybookåÛå a comedy-drama that was written and directed by David O. Russell and received eight Oscar nominations last year. Among this yearåÛåªs contenders he said Tracy Letts the playwright who wrote both the stage and screen versions of åÛåÏAugust: Osage CountyåÛå may become involved with at least an episode or two.         As for the Weinstein CompanyåÛåªs financial prospects Mr. Weinstein said a vigorous push into television would help it to raise the next round of financing whether through a public offering or otherwise.         åÛåÏIt certainly makes it easier for a liquidity eventåÛå he said.

He practiced holding his breath in bathtubs and Brooklyn swimming pools even seeing how far he could run with one gulp of oxygen. For roughly the past two years free diving consumed his life turning him from novice to national record-holder.         But on Sunday in pursuit of another record in a championship event in a hidden cove of the Bahamas in front of the best free divers in the world Mr. Mevoli came to the surface åÛåÓ but he was not all the way back. After diving down to 68 meters he paused and reached 72 meters before turning back. After staying under water for 3 minutes 38 seconds Mr. Mevoli 32 pulled off his goggles åÛåÓ and quickly fell into unconsciousness. He died soon after.         Mr. MevoliåÛåªs life and death reflect both the spirit of a fast-growing niche sport and its dangers. His rise from novice to record-holder in little more than a year serves both as an inspiration and as a dire warning to an undersea world of divers whose stars rise as the depths they reach plunge.         Free diving with ancestral roots in the ocean hunters of previous millennia is practiced by tens of thousands of certified recreational divers tracked by a web of free-diving agencies including AIDA the international governing body known by its French acronym. But competitive free diving in which athletes are not permitted to use snorkels or any oxygen supply remains a niche sport. The AIDA calendar comprises about 20 events through March some with nominal prize money. High-dollar sponsorships are few. Some of the top athletes teach courses on how to free dive but few if any make a living as a competitor.         Nicholas Mevoli on Sunday upon surfacing from a record attempt. He died a short time later. åÛåÏI really enjoy going on this journey where other people canåÛåªt goåÛå said Michael Board a British record-holder who went to compete in the Bahamas over the weekend. åÛåÏThe feeling of being deep under water somewhere youåÛåªre not meant to be and feeling this sort of mastery over your body and your mind and it being so peaceful and youåÛåªre not scared. ItåÛåªs a real achievement.åÛå         Kimmo Lahtinen the president of AIDA suggested that Mr. MevoliåÛåªs natural talent might have pushed him to the sportåÛåªs top tier too fast perhaps stripping him of the åÛåÏimportant experience that is needed to stay alive in an exceptional depth.åÛå         The organization said in a statement Monday that Mr. MevoliåÛåªs death was the first in more than 20 years of its competitions. It planned to review the accident åÛåÏto learn what we can do to prevent further serious injuries.åÛå         On Monday several dozen free divers who had swum with Mr. Mevoli gathered at DeanåÛåªs Blue Hole a legendary 200-meter cavity to remember Mr. Mevoli in the place where he attempted his last dive.         DeanåÛåªs Blue Hole is a circle of darkness in a turquoise-colored cove of Long Island a sparsely populated splinter of an island in the Bahamas. It may be a mecca for free divers the world over but locals have been warned by previous generations not to venture close; it was carved by the devil and will suck you into its depths.         Mr. Mevoli åÛåÏwalkedåÛå up a dive line while preparing for a dive at the Deja Blue III competition. Mr. Mevoli like his daring friends and competitors brushed off the danger. He loved the purity of free diving man against water man against himself no snorkel or oxygen tank. Swim into the depths of the ocean until the water turns from blue to black and the light fades to dark. Down down down every meter into the abyss meaning another meter back to the light.         åÛåÏWater is acceptance of the unknown of demons of emotions of letting go and allowing yourself to flow freely with itåÛå Mr. Mevoli wrote in a blog post in June. åÛåÏCome to the water willing to be consumed by it but also have confidence that your ability will bring you back.åÛå          A Diving åÛå÷HoboåÛåª   Mr. Mevoli lived in an apartment above a bar in Brooklyn. His door was usually open the couch available to whichever friend was passing through the city. On his Facebook page Mr. Mevoli åÛåÓ Nicholas or Nick sometimes Nic åÛåÓ made jokes about being a diving åÛåÏhobo.åÛå He posted photos of himself: striking light brown eyes lean sometimes mustachioed and often with fins in hand.         Raised mostly in Florida Mr. Mevoli was described by a trove of friends as someone who was both unique and a familiar type of single man in Brooklyn. He played drums and was a fan of Thelonious Monk. He took pride in the gnocchi he prepared along with his fish bakes. He traveled the world and was close with his grandfather a World War II veteran.         He played kickball in McCarren Park went to concerts with friends wrote screenplays and acted on stage. He had a handful of odd jobs over the years including work in a bagel shop. He was a talented BMX biker handy with tools often seen riding his bike while wearing a tool belt on his way to work as a prop manager.         He was a member of Rising Sun Performance Company where he was a performer technician and writer. But a little more than two years ago he curbed his acting roles to focus more on free diving. He spent tens of thousands of dollars on the sport.         Mr. Mevoli was drawn to the ocean from a young age said his stepfather Fred Rudzik. The two did scuba diving lessons together when Mr. Mevoli was a teenager in Florida. åÛåÏHe always loved wateråÛå Mr. Rudzik said.         Two years ago Mr. Mevoli was taking intermediate-level free-diving classes at Immersion Freediving of Fort Lauderdale Fla. In May 2012 he plunged to a depth of 91 meters in his first major competition in the åÛåÏconstant weightåÛå discipline which allows for a fin on the feet to help propel the diver.         Safety divers guided Mr. Mevoli to the surface after he blacked out 30 meters under water in May 2012. Ted Harty the companyåÛåªs founder and a record-setting diver himself congratulated his student on Facebook for his åÛåÏamazing progressåÛå in going from 30 meters to more than twice that depth in a matter of months.         åÛåÏI canåÛåªt wait to see what he can doåÛå Mr. Harty wrote in the post.         Mr. MevoliåÛåªs training in New York included swimming in still pools his stepfather said as well as running up and down flights of stairs holding his breath. His family said he was not surprised that he was breaking records so soon after he discovered the sport. åÛåÏMaybe he pushed his body beyond where many athletes doåÛå Mr. Rudzik said.         In May off the coast of Honduras Mr. Mevoli established an American record by dropping 100 meters in the constant-weight discipline. He was under water for 2 minutes 45 seconds.         Mr. Lahtinen the president of AIDA said the sportåÛåªs safety record was quite strong. The organization which is 21 years old has a database of 35000 dives åÛåÓ and he said serious accidents in organized competitions were almost never seen.         But as the popularity of free diving surges Mr. Lahtinen said safety is going to remain a central issue.         William Trubridge left and Nicholas Mevoli relaxed at a competition in Honduras in May. åÛåÏNick was an exceptional talent in this sportåÛå Mr. Lahtinen said. åÛåÏI think this was one of the things which may have something to do with this accident.åÛå         He added: åÛåÏYou are going to the limits faster and faster. When you are dealing with this kind of depth it is something where you need a lot of experience.åÛå         Two months ago as Mr. Mevoli won a silver medal at the world championships in Greece he was temporarily frustrated with his performance and mental state. In a blog on www.usfreediving.org he told of wandering the city streets after a constant-weight dive to 75 meters occasionally spitting blood on the sidewalk. He wondered why he was so consumed by reaching tangible depths.         åÛåÏNumbers infected my head like a virus and the need to achieve became an obsession. Obsessions can killåÛå he wrote.         He added: åÛåÏI ask you would you like me any less if I was only a diver who couldnåÛåªt make it past 20m?åÛå          Pressure and Lungs   Sea creatures are made primarily of water which is virtually incompressible. So they thrive.         But humans are full of voids åÛåÓ most prominently the lungs. When humans descend to greater depths the rising pressure forces the lungs to shrink in size.         Water is almost 1000 times denser than air and the enormous pressure from its sheer weightiness mounts rapidly during descent. As you go down by weight every 10 cubic feet of seawater equals roughly one cubic foot of lead.         Francisco Ferreras-Rodriguez of Cuba who set a world record for diving without the aid of breathing gear plunged in 1996 to a depth of 436 feet. Studies later showed that the seaåÛåªs pressure at 400 feet compressed his chest size by more than half åÛåÓ lowering it from a circumference of 50 inches at the surface down to 20 inches.         Marine mammals that routinely dive deep have lungs that can collapse entirely. Some have chests built like accordions åÛåÓ designed to fold. Whales seals and other deep-diving mammals store oxygen not in their lungs but in networks of powerful muscles.         For humans the crushing deep poses unique challenges. Scuba diving mitigates the most obvious obstacle with oxygen tanks. Casual divers typically go down no farther than about 100 feet limiting the water pressures and lung contractions that they experience.         But as free divers descend they experience a rapid shrinkage of the lungs and the compression of the gases inside. That enriches the bloodstream with the two main components of the air åÛåÓ oxygen and nitrogen.         One danger is nitrogen narcosis or rapture of the deep which prompts a kind of giddy stupidity that encourages risk-taking. The drunkenness is thought to arise when excess nitrogen in the bloodstream and organs prompts nerve impulses to slow. The physiological effect is thought to be similar to the action of nitrous oxide an anesthetic that produces pleasurable sensations.         Such befuddlement experts say may have prompted Mr. Mevoli to disregard symptoms of danger and suddenly renew his quest to dive deeper. He paused and seemed to turn back toward the surface at 68 meters or 223 feet but then turned around and proceeded to dive deeper.         Barbara Jeschke a doctor and the Vertical Blue organizer William Trubridge preparing adrenaline to administer to Nicholas Mevoli on the platform Medical experts say deadly problems can arise as a diver goes ever downward and pressures from the water keep rising.         åÛåÏThereåÛåªs a limit to lung compression when you dive deepåÛå said Dr. Paul J. Ponganis a practicing anesthesiologist and a physiologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. åÛåÏThis sport is always pushing that limit.åÛå         Blood from the legs and arms gets forced into the heart and chest cavity which in humans is kept from total collapse by the bony rib cage and other chest structures. Typically the body of an adult male holds roughly five liters of blood and studies have shown that the outer pressure on divers can send up to one liter of excess blood flowing into the chest cavity.         At first that pooling of blood around the heart and lungs is a good thing supplying the diver with life-giving oxygen.         But as the pressures rise the fragile human body gets transformed into a kind of pressure cooker that is squeezed hard on all sides åÛåÓ by extreme water pressure on the outside and blood pressure on the inside.         Dr. Ponganis said the added pressure in the circulatory system radiated through the lungs and could force blood vessels and capillaries in the lungs to burst and bleed åÛåÓ in the worst case slowly filling the lungs with blood.         åÛåÏEverything in the chest is getting squeezedåÛå he said. åÛåÏCapillaries are being distended. Blood vessels in the lungs distend and rupture. Even the pulmonary vessels become engorged.åÛå         Athletes in free-diving competitions often return to the surface with bloody noses. But Dr. Ponganis said that the cardiovascular dysfunctions in Mr. MevoliåÛåªs fatal dive appeared to have been much worse.         Dr. Ponganis said Mr. Mevoli probably suffocated his lungs unable to absorb the oxygen in the air. But he cautioned that only an autopsy would be able to detail the likely cause of death.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs a sad caseåÛå he said. åÛåÏTo me itåÛåªs a very dangerous sport. It pushes your physiology to the limits.åÛå          Best Place to Free Dive   Free divers consider DeanåÛåªs Blue Hole the best place in the world to free dive åÛåÓ a seemingly bottomless pit (actually more than 200 meters deep) of limestone. Last weekend it was the scene of Vertical Blue the sportåÛåªs crowning event with 35 athletes representing 16 countries.         But at 11:10 a.m. local time Monday a crowd of 80 mourners gathered on the crescent-shaped beach. Some came with flowers and began passing them around. Three women linked arms beneath a parasol. A Shins song crooned from the public-address system used to announce dives during the competition.         Japanese free divers at a memorial service for Nicholas Mevoli at DeanåÛåªs Blue Hole. All other traces of the competition were gone including the platform where attempts were made to revive Mr. Mevoli the day before.         The free divers gathered were among the worldåÛåªs best and most experienced but they acknowledged that they knew relatively little about their sportåÛåªs safety protocol.         åÛåÏBecause there is so little proper medical information on lung squeezes we only think we know the risksåÛå said Mr. Board the British record-holder. åÛåÏWe go into dives going on feeling.åÛå         One by one those in the free-diving fraternity stepped forward to offer their own grace notes.         åÛåÏHe always wanted to hold his breath and diveåÛå said Ren Chapman Mr. MevoliåÛåªs training partner. åÛåÏThat was his life.åÛå         William Trubridge a world-record-holder and organizer of Vertical Blue recalled a day when he and Mr. Mevoli were snorkeling in Honduras. Mr. Trubridge saw a turtle and began to take pictures. Mr. Mevoli took the camera away and told Mr. Trubridge to enjoy the moment to swim with the turtle.         At the ceremonyåÛåªs end mourners swam together to the center of the blue hole and formed a circle over the shadowy depths below their feet. They took a collective breath and dived under the water.         Fellow competitors of Nicholas Mevoli at Vertical Blue gathered to pay tribute to him in DeanåÛåªs Blue Hole where he attempted a free-diving record Sunday. He died later that day. åÛåÏWhen we have a new national record or world record the tradition is to splash the hell out of themåÛå Grant Graves the lead judge at Vertical Blue said. åÛåÏLetåÛåªs celebrate his life like we celebrated his record in Honduras. So letåÛåªs splash it out for him.åÛå         The group batted and kicked the water in celebration. Some gritted their teeth in anger; others laughed. The hole foamed and frothed.

The throttle was still engaged åÛåÓ giving the engine power åÛåÓ until six seconds before the locomotive in the rear of the train came to a stop around 7:20 a.m. Sunday after the train careered toward the Harlem River killing four people and injuring more than 70 north of Spuyten Duyvil station in the Bronx officials said.         The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation and a board member Earl Weener said the trainåÛåªs sudden power shift came åÛåÏvery late in the game.åÛå The board cautioned that it remained unclear if the speed was the result of human error or faulty equipment.         But the extraordinary speed shed new light on the deadliest New York City train derailment in more than two decades and heightened the focus on the veteran engineer at the center of the investigation. The maximum allowable speed through the curve is 30 m.p.h.; even the straightaway north of the crash site permits speeds no greater than 70 m.p.h.         Asked if the safety board was looking into the possibility that the engineer William Rockefeller fell asleep was using his cellphone or was otherwise distracted a spokesman for the board Keith Holloway said åÛåÏPart of our investigation as in all investigations is to look at human performance factors.åÛå         Mr. RockefelleråÛåªs cellphone was recovered as åÛåÏpart of our routine processåÛå Mr. Weener said and the results of drug and alcohol tests conducted after the crash were not yet known. Mr. Rockefeller was treated at a hospital and released.         The authorities said that the trainåÛåªs brakes appeared to have been operating effectively shortly before the crash.         åÛåÏWe are not aware of any problems or anomalies with the brakesåÛå Mr. Weener said.         Senator Charles E. Schumer noted åÛåÏThe train did make nine stops before coming to this curve. So clearly the brakes were working a short time before.åÛå         He added that he was told by the safety board that the tracks in the area also seemed to have been in proper condition.         The revelations came as workers raised the train cars åÛåÓ all seven and the locomotive had been derailed åÛåÓ and thousands of commuters were forced to use alternative routes. The police and prosecutors began a parallel investigation to see if a crime had been committed.         The safety boardåÛåªs interview with Mr. Rockefeller a Metro-North employee who lives in Germantown N.Y. was cut short Monday afternoon and is to continue this week officials said.         Anthony Bottalico the acting director of the Association of Commuter Rail Employees said that the interview was postponed because of åÛåÏthe trauma of the whole thing and the lack of sleepåÛå for Mr. Rockefeller.         Several law enforcement officials said that detectives from the New York City and Metropolitan Transportation Authority police with assistance from the office of the Bronx district attorney Robert T. Johnson were mounting an investigation parallel to the safety boardåÛåªs inquiry.         That was being done to collect evidence if officials determine a crime occurred three law enforcement officials said. The safety board is not a law enforcement agency; its role is limited to issuing findings and making recommendations.         Prosecutors from Mr. JohnsonåÛåªs office were at the scene of the derailment on Sunday and two officials said the prosecutors had issued subpoenas for the engineeråÛåªs blood samples for drug and alcohol testing and for his cellphone.         Mr. Bottalico predicted that åÛåÏwhen all is said and done hereåÛå the authorities would find there was åÛåÏno criminal intent.åÛå         A senior official with the transportation authority has said that Mr. Rockefeller initially told emergency workers that he åÛåÏdumped the brakesåÛå an emergency maneuver after he realized he was traveling too quickly.

It is an audacious goal.         There are no distance coaches in Sierra Leone one of the poorest countries in the world so Kargbo works under the tutelage of a local sprinter. Like many in the muggy tropical climes of West Africa he is felled by malaria about once a year: he has no doctor but knows from the delirious fever and cold sweats that accompany the condition.         If his legs hurt his solution lies at the local pharmacy. åÛåÏI buy hot rub and put it where the pain isåÛå he said.         His weekly long run is 25 miles winding through the beaches and hills and traffic-clogged streets of Freetown where throngs of bystanders gawk and cheer. In Sierra Leone running is an unusual pastime as it is in most of Africa where people gravitate toward soccer. When West Africans do take to the track it is usually to sprint. The region churns out world-class sprinters but has had few long-distance champions.         åÛåÏWhen I run at home people think itåÛåªs strangeåÛå Kargbo said. åÛåÏBut I keep going anyway. I think itåÛåªs part of my blood now. It is my passion and it is my talent.åÛå         In pursing that talent Kargbo has become the best marathon runner his small country has produced.         Kargbo 22 won the Sierra Leone marathon last year in 2 hours 38 minutes 27 seconds and then beat that time in Liberia in August running 2:35:15 a national best for his country. Kargbo won $1500 at that marathon far more than an average yearåÛåªs salary in his country. He placed the prize money in his saving account and no longer has to worry about paying for food.         åÛåÏMy main food for running is riceåÛå he said. åÛåÏAnd for a treat I buy juice and cassava leaves.åÛå         More important the New York City Marathon accepted him into its sub-elite field one level below the professional runners.         He hoped the New York City Marathon would propel him into a higher echelon of runners but he ended the day in a hospital where he was treated for exposure. His time was a disappointing 2:58:54 but he is determined to improve.         Where he is from a runneråÛåªs life is fraught with challenges. The 5-foot-3 Kargbo structures his runs around days spent as a coffee courier walking between office buildings peddling beverages. The job earns him $80 a month åÛåÓ a respectable salary in a country where about 60 percent of citizens live below the national poverty line. He trains at 5 a.m. to avoid the suffocating midday heat.         Kargbo never knew his mother and grew up sleeping in the living room of a house he shared with his grandmother stepmother and an aunt. Later when he moved to Freetown to support himself and pursue his running career he slept on a mattress in the corner of a barren room in an abandoned hospital. He often could not afford enough food.         He completed high school at age 20 like many Sierra Leoneans whose lives were interrupted by a wrenching civil war. He saw his best friend shot to death at age 7 by rebels as he fled with besieged villagers into the bush.         Kargbo considers himself fortunate by relative standards however. åÛåÏSome people had their arms and feet cut offåÛå he said. åÛåÏBut luckily not my family.åÛå         His trip to New York was his first time out of Sierra Leone save for the bus trip to neighboring Liberia for the marathon there in August. His chaperone a former aid worker from Australia named Jo Dunlop financed his trip through a crowdsourcing campaign. Dunlop found them a place to stay in Fort Greene Brooklyn.         When he told his grandmother he was going to run in New York she replied åÛåÏI told you one day you are going to represent your country.åÛå She could not watch because her village the one where Kargbo grew up has no television.         He said he knew New York would pose a new challenge. åÛåÏItåÛåªs the biggest competitionåÛå he said. åÛåÏMy coach told me: åÛå÷You are a small athlete. The winners are big athletes. If you compete with them you will not finish the race.åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå         In many ways KargboåÛåªs career has been a lonely one. He is faster than anyone he knows so he has no one to push him to improve. He has nearly no way of connecting with the pockets of elite runners in other parts of Africa that have produced champion marathoners like Khalid Khannouchi Willie Mtolo and Geoffrey Mutai.         åÛåÏI run against myselfåÛå he said.         But there are signs of a nascent distance running movement percolating in West Africa. Sierra Leone and Liberia have each recently started marathons which are populated by locals eager to try the sport. But times lag behind international standards.         Kargbo though has raised the profile of the sport becoming something of a hero in a country that is eager for symbols of national pride. When he visited a West African restaurant in the Bronx recently the patrons knew who he was.         David Epstein author of åÛåÏThe Sports GeneåÛå said West African runners had a long way to go.         åÛåÏIf there were cultural incentives and more of a fan base in West Africa you might find more talented distance runners thereåÛå he said. åÛåÏYou arenåÛåªt going to find the talent if the sport isnåÛåªt popular or part of a tradition. No one wonders why hockey isnåÛåªt coming out of West Africa.åÛå         Kargbo found inspiration in August when he ran in Liberia. Nathan Naibei an elite Kenyan runner showed up and easily set the pace. With little competition Naibei instead focused on Kargbo who was trailing him urging him to keep pace and handing him cups of water. The two now trade emails and Naibei recently sent him a training plan. Kargbo tries to follow it aspiring to be like his counterparts across the continent.         He is not there yet. He is hoping to make the London Marathon and try again to establish himself on the international stage. But for this runner that finish line is a long way away.

The lender 33 percent owned by the British government which put up 20.5 billion pounds to save it from collapse said on Tuesday it had sold around 109 million shares in St James's Place to financial institutions at 630 pence per share.         Gross proceeds excluding costs and expenses were 680 million pounds and the bank said it would make a profit on the sale of 105 million pounds.         Lloyds needs to plug an 8.6 billon pound shortfall identified by Britain's financial regulator in June before it can persuade the regulator to allow to pay dividends again and is currently selling non-core assets to strengthen its balance sheet and focus on lending to UK households and businesses.         It has also reduced its loan book cut costs and reined in bad debts helping its shares to more than treble in value over the past two years and enabling the government to start offloading its stake in the bank.         ""We see no controversy at all with the (widely anticipated) resumption of cash dividends at 2013 full-year results in February"" said Investec analyst Ian Gordon.         Lloyds also said on Tuesday that the sale of its 21 percent stake in St James's Place would increase its common equity Tier 1 capital by about 24 basis points under full Basel III capital rules. Its core tier 1 ratio - a gauge of a bank's financial strength - stood at 9.9 percent at the end of the third quarter. Lloyds is targeting a core tier 1 ratio of above 10 percent by the end of 2013.         Lloyds has taken a number of steps to bolster its capital selling businesses and loans that are not deemed to fit with its long-term strategy. It has also cut back on the countries in which it operates and expects to be in less than 10 by the end of 2014 compared with 30 two years ago.         Lloyds previously sold a 20 percent stake in St James's Place in March and a further 15 percent in May. Last month it sold its fund management arm Scottish Widows to Aberdeen Asset Management. The bank is also planning a stock market flotation of more than 600 branches which have been rebranded TSB which it must sell to satisfy EU state aid rules.         Meanwhile the bank's sale of non-core loan portfolios has gathered pace in recent weeks. Last week it sold a portfolio of Irish home loans to U.S.  private equity  firm Apollo for 257 million pounds and last month it sold a 1 billion euro book of euro-zone commercial real estate loans to U.S. hedge fund Cerberus.         Shares in Lloyds were up 0.7 percent to 78.8 pence at 1040 GMT with St James's Place shares up 0.5 percent to 647 pence.         St James's Place reported a recorded level of funds under management in October boosted by buoyant markets and a surge in inflows as investor confidence returned. The sale means it will become full independent for the first time since Halifax bought a 60 percent stake 13 years ago.         (Reporting by Matt Scuffham; Editing by Sophie Walker)        "

For six more weeks two of the strongest and most interesting female leads on television are being played by Asian-American actresses.         IåÛåªm talking about  Maggie Q  finishing her turn as Nikita and  Lucy Liu  in her second season as Joan Watson on CBSåÛåªs åÛåÏElementaryåÛå where she is every bit as central as Jonny Lee MilleråÛåªs Sherlock Holmes. Both shows have their formulaic elements but Nikita and Joan are noncartoonish reasonably complex multidimensional characters and in prime time there arenåÛåªt too many actresses getting that kind of opportunity in a lead role. Julianna Margulies in åÛåÏThe Good WifeåÛå Connie Britton in åÛåÏNashvilleåÛå Claire Danes in åÛåÏHomelandåÛå Lizzy Caplan in åÛåÏMasters of Sex.åÛå ItåÛåªs a short list.         Of course that broader look also indicates that the overall picture for Asian actresses (American Canadian and otherwise) isnåÛåªt so happy. A lot of them are working but in roles far down the food chain from Nikita and Watson and often playing characters conceived or shaped to reflect longstanding stereotypes about Asians.         Even Maggie Q and Ms. Liu havenåÛåªt completely escaped those archetypes. Both are playing the latest iterations of durable characters traditionally inhabited by white performers so it would seem that race shouldnåÛåªt have any particular bearing. But the truth is that they resonate with two of the most common sets of images åÛåÓ or clichÌÄå©s åÛåÓ about Asian women: the high-achieving socially awkward Dr. Joan Watson is a refined example of the sexy nerd and the lethal sometimes icy Nikita able to dispense violence while wearing tight microscopic outfits evokes a long line of dragon ladies and ninja killers.         (You could argue that the association exists only because Maggie Q was cast as Nikita who is based on a French film character but itåÛåªs a self-canceling argument: The men who created the show sought her out for the role.)         In both cases though the actresses and their writers have avoided or transcended easy stereotypes. A lot of effort has gone into humanizing Nikita and making her a sisterly or even maternal figure for the younger assassin Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca) and the emphasis on violent action has decreased over the showåÛåªs run. In åÛåÏElementaryåÛå Watson has embraced her role as apprentice detective after suffering a catastrophic failure as a doctor taking some of the shine off her super-competence. And unlike other characters in the same mold she appears to have a normal nonneurotic romantic life.         Clothes also tell a tale. Maggie Q fought some battles over her costumes in the early days of åÛåÏNikitaåÛå and she has spent progressively more time in plain covered-up (though still closefitting) workout-style ensembles and less in skimpy red dresses. Ms. LiuåÛåªs outfits mostly chosen by the costume designer Rebecca Hofherr have attracted a following of their own. The majority opinion seems to be that they reflect WatsonåÛåªs quirky but confident style. To my eye they have a clever awfulness making Ms. Liu look good while signaling that perhaps she doesnåÛåªt spend as much time as she could in front of a mirror.         Either way what WatsonåÛåªs clothes donåÛåªt do is make her look ridiculous or hide Ms. LiuåÛåªs attractiveness. ThatåÛåªs the fate of some other Asian-American actresses in roles that play more obviously to geekiness or braininess and are visually coded for easy comprehension. Liza Lapira wears fright clothes and dowdy haircuts as the sidekick Helen-Alice on åÛåÏSuper Fun NightåÛå (ABC) something she already endured as the eccentric neighbor on åÛåÏDonåÛåªt Trust the B åÛåÓ åÛåÓ in Apt. 23åÛå last season. On åÛåÏAwkwardåÛå (MTV) Jessica Lu as the rebellious daughter of strict Chinese parents sports a hat with ears while Jessika Van as her Asian rival is dressed in starched outfits that make her look like an Amish schoolteacher. Both Ms. Lapira and Ms. Lu are accessorized with glasses åÛåÓ big black ones åÛåÓ something neither appears to wear in real life. Also occasionally donning glasses is Brenda Song as a video-game company executive in åÛåÏDadsåÛå on Fox though her most distinctive costume remains the sailor-girl outfit she wore in the pilot part of an extended joke about the sexualization of Asian women that didnåÛåªt accomplish much besides sexualizing an Asian woman.         And there are other actresses playing less evolved versions of the Nikita-style action hero. Ming-Na WenåÛåªs Melinda May the black-leather-jacketed pilot in åÛåÏMarvelåÛåªs Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.åÛå (ABC) is a stoic enforcer with a dragon-lady vibe; Grace ParkåÛåªs Kono Kalakaua on åÛåÏHawaii Five-0åÛå (CBS) is equally lethal (she often does most of the kicking and punching) but favors bikinis and tight jeans. On åÛåÏOnce Upon a TimeåÛå (ABC) Jamie Chung plays the Disney version of a mythical Chinese swordswoman.         It takes some looking to find Asian actresses in roles that donåÛåªt easily fit into one of these two broad categories. There are a few jobs in a third category the manipulative or overly protective Asian mother: Jodi Long on åÛåÏSullivan and SonåÛå (TBS) Lauren Tom on åÛåÏSupernaturalåÛå (CW). On the entertaining but paper-thin åÛåÏBeauty and the BeaståÛå (also on CW) Kristin Kreuk stars as a cop who just happens to be mixed race. There is of course a major Asian-Canadian female television star not mentioned yet: Sandra Oh whose Dr. Cristina Yang is not the lead but is a major member of the ensemble on ABCåÛåªs åÛåÏGreyåÛåªs Anatomy.åÛå As with Nikita and Watson Yang displays some typical Asian markers åÛåÓ sheåÛåªs a hypercompetitive socially awkward doctor åÛåÓ whose race is matter of fact because thereåÛåªs so much more to know about her. Yang along with Watson and Nikita could be considered exceptions that prove a rule but I think the real lesson here is probably that TV would be a better place for women of all races if Shonda Rhimes (åÛåÏGreyåÛåªs AnatomyåÛå åÛåÏScandalåÛå) could just write all the shows.

Mr. Acosta 57 owns a small moving company in Sierra Vista Ariz. which he said had barely made it through the recession. He was thinking about dropping his coverage but the insurance company beat him to it informing him recently that it would cancel his policy at yearåÛåªs end.         He sought advice from an insurance agent who had used his moving company. She connected him with an application counselor at a community health center who found åÛåÓ to Mr. AcostaåÛåªs astonishment åÛåÓ that he qualified for  Medicaid  under the new health care law the Affordable Care Act which gives states the option of expanding the program to include more low-income adults.         åÛåÏIåÛåªm kind of in a disbelieving fogåÛå Mr. Acosta said last week two days after completing an application. åÛåÏIåÛåªm just hoping keeping my fingers crossed that this might really help me out.åÛå         The  rollout of the health care law  has been plagued with problems so deep that even some of its strongest supporters have soured on its potential. The bottlenecks in the federal online insurance exchange which serves 36 states; the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of policies that did not comply with the minimum requirements of the new law; and the high price of some plans sold through both federal and state-run exchanges have all cast a pall over  President ObamaåÛåªs efforts to win support  for the law.         But for all those problems people are enrolling. More than 243000 have signed up for private coverage through the exchanges according to the Kaiser Family Foundation and more than 567000 have been determined eligible for Medicaid since the exchanges opened on Oct. 1. For many particularly people with existing medical conditions like Mr. Acosta the coverage is proving less expensive than what they had. Many others are getting health insurance for the first time in years giving them alternatives to seeking care through free clinics or emergency rooms åÛåÓ or putting it off indefinitely.         Not all who need health insurance are happy with their new options. Many have complained that the prices are too high especially if they earn too much to qualify for federal subsidies. And many will have a limited choice of doctors and hospitals under the new exchange plans which have åÛåÏnarrow networksåÛå to hold down premiums.         But Mr. Acosta like the people in the following profiles says the health care law has given him a cautious sense of hope.         He lives alone and has turned to his siblings at times for help with his insurance and medical costs. And those costs have at times been high: He sees an oncologist in Tucson twice a year and sometimes needs expensive tests that his current insurance does not always cover. He has also recently been stretching his medication a drug called Gleevec which helps make his type of leukemia manageable to ensure he would have some on hand if he became uninsured.         åÛåÏAfter being gouged all these years trying to make ends meet to all of the sudden get this?åÛå he said. åÛåÏIåÛåªm really blown away.åÛå         Claire He a college student in Ann Arbor Mich. who helped her parents find an affordable health plan Claire He grew up worrying about her parentsåÛåª health.

His humility his compassion and his humanity earned him their love.åÛå         Mr. Zuma called Mr. MandelaåÛåªs death åÛåÏthe moment of our deepest sorrowåÛå and said that South AfricaåÛåªs thoughts were now with the former presidentåÛåªs family. åÛåÏThey have sacrificed much and endured much so that our people could be freeåÛå he said.         Mr. Mandela spent 27 years in prison after being convicted of treason by the white minority government only to forge a peaceful end to white rule by negotiating with his captors after his release in 1990. He led the African National Congress long a banned liberation movement to a resounding electoral victory in 1994 the first fully democratic election in the countryåÛåªs history.         Mr. Mandela who was 95 served just one term as South AfricaåÛåªs president and had not been seen in public since 2010 when the nation hosted the soccer World Cup. But his decades in prison and his insistence on forgiveness over vengeance made him a potent symbol of the struggle to end this countryåÛåªs brutally codified system of racial domination and of the power of peaceful resolution in even the most intractable conflicts.         Years after he retreated from public life his name still resonated as an emblem of his effort to transcend decades of racial division and create what South Africans called a Rainbow Nation.         åÛåÏHis commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him set an example that all humanity should aspire toåÛå a grim President Obama said Thursday evening describing Mr. Mandela as an åÛåÏinfluential courageous and profoundly goodåÛå man who inspired millions åÛåÓ including himself åÛåÓ to a spirit of reconciliation.         Mr. Mandela and Mr. Obama both served as the first black leaders of their nations and both men won the Nobel Peace Prize. But the American president has shied away from comparisons often noting that his own sacrifices would never compare to the ones that Mr. Mandela endured.         Mr. Obama said that the world would åÛåÏnot likely see the likes of Nelson Mandela againåÛå and he noted that the former South African president had once said that he was åÛåÏnot a saint unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.åÛå         Mr. Zuma did not announce the specific cause of Mr. MandelaåÛåªs death but he had battling pneumonia and other lung ailments for the past six months and had been in and out of the hospital. Though his death was announced close to midnight when most in this nation of early risers are asleep a small crowd quickly gathered outside the house where he once lived in Soweto on Vilekazi Street.         åÛåÏNelson Mandela there is no one like youåÛå they sang stamping their feet in unison to a praise song usually sung in joy. But in the midnight darkness sadness tinged the melody.         åÛåÏHe was our father our mother our everythingåÛå said Numfundo Matli 28 a housekeeper who joined the impromptu celebration of Mr. MandelaåÛåªs life. åÛåÏWhat will we do without him?åÛå         His death comes during a period of deep unease and painful self-examination for South Africa.         In the past year and a half the country has faced perhaps its most serious unrest since the end of apartheid provoked by a wave of wildcat  strikes by angry miners  a  deadly response on the part of the police  a messy  leadership struggle within the A.N.C.  and the deepening fissures between South AfricaåÛåªs rulers and its impoverished masses.         Scandals over corruption involving senior members of the party have fed a broader perception that Mr. MandelaåÛåªs near saintly legacy from the years of struggle has been eroded by a more recent scramble for self-enrichment among a newer elite.         After spending decades in penurious exile many political figures returned to find themselves at the center of a grab for power and money. Mr. Zuma himself was charged with corruption before rising to the presidency in 2009 though the charges were dropped on largely technical grounds. He has  faced renewed scrutiny  in the past year over $27 million spent in renovations to his house in rural Zululand.

For Shelby Miller a 23-year-old player on the roster of the St. Louis Cardinals not being selected to pitch for his team in this yearåÛåªs World Series put him in an even lonelier place.         And when he needed to vent about being left in the bullpen Amy Peters was the one person he could express his frustration to. åÛåÏShe would remind me that I was good and that there was some reason unknown to us why I wasnåÛåªt pitchingåÛå Mr. Miller said.         His postseason absence is not an indictment of his career. He placed third in the 2013 National League rookie-of-the-year voting. He is åÛåÏdefinitely a young pitcher to watchåÛå said Kary Booher sports editor for The Springfield News-Leader in Missouri.         For the last two and a half years Ms. Peters 22 has been Mr. MilleråÛåªs most loyal cheerleader. They met in June 2011 when he began playing for the Springfield Cardinals a minor league team; Ms. Peters was a member of its cheering squad. åÛåÏWe had to sign a piece of paper telling us we could not socialize with the playersåÛå she said. åÛåÏIåÛåªve always been really bad at following rules.åÛå         Their love story began like that of many couples barely out of their teens: physical attraction similar personalities and a lot of chemistry. But they would soon test whether their bond was strong enough to survive the world of professional baseball.         åÛåÏI had noticed immediately that Amy was beautifulåÛå Mr. Miller said and he was drawn to her lively and outgoing personality. He wasted no time in calling her åÛåÓ despite the fact that he had recently started casually dating someone else.         She too found him attractive but had a boyfriend of three years. That boyfriend however had recently taken a job out of state and she wasnåÛåªt ready to give up her life in Springfield to follow him. Besides her cheerleading job she was enjoying her work at a hair salon.         She and Mr. Miller began texting each other frequently. åÛåÏI was flattered by the attention but I was standoffish because he was so sure of himselfåÛå said Ms. Peters who also feared that a relationship with a ballplayer would be fleeting at best.         But the mutual attraction remained strong and he won her over with his sense of humor and his sweetness Ms. Peters said adding that she saw his genuine side. Within weeks both had broken off the other relationship.         At practices and games they kept their budding feelings a secret but Mr. Miller sent her flirtatious texts from the locker room.         Soon they were seeing each other after practice with a group of friends. This inner circle noticed a change in Mr. Miller. åÛåÏHe matured a lot quicker than most playersåÛå said Joe Kelly another St. Louis Cardinals pitcher and a close friend of his. åÛåÏA lot of that had to do with meeting Amy.åÛå         Ms. Peters liked that he defied most of her stereotypes of baseball players: He didnåÛåªt wear heavy chains around his neck he wasnåÛåªt cocky and he didnåÛåªt act like a player when it came to women. åÛåÏHe was just really down to earthåÛå she said.         Mr. Miller found himself drawn to her tight-knit family life which resembled his own.         Soon after the 2011 baseball season four months after they met he said she took him home to her family at the resort they own and live at in Eminence Mo. a town of 600.         Her mother Lynett Peters noticed that Mr. Miller at first appeared very shy. åÛåÏIåÛåªm sure he must have been intimidatedåÛå Mrs. Peters said. åÛåÏBut we just clicked.åÛå         While kayaking during that visit Mr. Miller formally asked her to be his girlfriend.

You could start by combing the National TheateråÛåªs stage adaptation of åÛåÏEmil and the DetectivesåÛå which may just be the most kids-intensive production I have ever seen. ThatåÛåªs saying a lot in a theater capital that is also showing åÛåÏCharlie and the Chocolate FactoryåÛå åÛåÏMatildaåÛå and åÛåÏBilly ElliotåÛå three musicals that give pride of place to many a pint-sized tyke.         But none of those three can quite match the sense of recess run rampant that has taken over the NationalåÛåªs capacious Olivier stage in a show featuring 60 children.         And then raise that number to 180 given that three rotating casts will be keeping backstage chaperones busy throughout an engagement that finishes on March 18.         Their energy as it happens is the abiding virtue of Bijan SheibaniåÛåªs production an undeniable logistical triumph that nonetheless gives off the air of a project that is possibly more fun to be in than it is to watch.         Based on the German writer Erich KÌÄå_stneråÛåªs time-honored 1929 childrenåÛåªs novel the book previously adapted for the London stage in 1934 resurfaces here in a version by Carl Miller a onetime theater critic. We witness the growing empowerment of the earnest 10-year-old Emil (played on opening night by Ethan Hammer) whose hairdresser-mother (Naomi Frederick) gives the schoolboy 140 marks to take to his grandmother by train from the provinces to the big city. The cash is stolen en route by a plump baddie Mr. Snow (Stuart McQuarrie) who doesnåÛåªt reckon on the solidarity that lies in wait as the pre-pubescent populace of Weimar-era Berlin come hurtling to EmilåÛåªs aid.         These young accomplices have names like Tuesday and Toots and Pony the Hat and they take to the stage with brio and the odd wink to the very playgoers whom they then clamber among in the second act. (This infiltrating of the audience by the cast is becoming an irksome London habit: Precisely the same occurs in the new English National Opera production of åÛåÏThe Magic Flute.åÛå)         But even as one is wondering whether thatåÛåªs all there is åÛåÓ slightness on the page can look amplified on stage åÛåÓ the designs lift the evening to a level of visual finesse that is unusual even at this address.         Drawing on the NationalåÛåªs apparently limitless resources including an ace projection team in 59 Productions Bunny Christie has devised a German Expressionist landscape of ever-shifting and swirling perspectives that bring to life a bustling metropolis reaching down to the sewers. I donåÛåªt know what tuition is being offered to the children backstage during the run but they have an entire Vorticist landscape unfolding breathtakingly around them. I hope theyåÛåªre taking notes.         Keeping with both the Teutonic setting and the art historical references the OlivieråÛåªs neighboring auditorium the Lyttelton has just opened a rare production of åÛåÏFrom Morning to MidnightåÛå a long-neglected play (in English anyway) from the German repertory that the children next door would doubtless find pretty heavy going. Make that quite a few adults as well.         The theme of Georg KaiseråÛåªs 1912 parable seen here in a version from the Tony-winning writer Dennis Kelly (åÛåÏMatildaåÛå) is the destabilizing and dehumanizing effect of money. So itåÛåªs not a little ironic that Melly StillåÛåªs all-stops-out production looks as if it must have cost a small fortune.         Soutra GilmouråÛåªs set keeps transforming itself in front of our eyes referencing along the way various German painters (Ernst Kirchner and Otto Dix for starters). Andrzej GouldingåÛåªs projections lend a celluloid component to a highly stylized piece of theatrical artifice that charts the financial and moral reckoning of an unnamed bank clerk (Adam Godley) who absconds with 60000 marks across the long day indicated in the title åÛåÓ a clock keeps us apprised of timeåÛåªs onward passage until it is obscured from view.         A hard-working Mr. Godley (late of LondonåÛåªs åÛåÏPillowmanåÛå and the Broadway revival of åÛåÏAnything GoesåÛå) lends a hangdog demeanor and limber physicality to this Everyman figure who exists to be taught a life lesson. His conclusion: åÛåÏMoney decreases worth; that is the real truth.åÛå Now IåÛåªve saved you the price of a ticket.         The design and one or two performances are more or less the only reasons to catch åÛåÏStrangers on a TrainåÛå a third production to put visuals at the forefront of the evening.         Craig WarneråÛåªs play draws from the 1950 Patricia Highsmith novel that led to the Alfred Hitchcock film a year later whose rabid homoerotic undercurrents can be felt anew this time around. So far so tantalizing you might think except that Robert Allan AckermanåÛåªs production signals from the start that something is not quite right.         Barely have our two anti-heroes met aboard a train to plot their mutually convenient scheme of murder before Bruno (Jack Huston) twice extols Guy (Laurence Fox) for having åÛåÏa sparkåÛå åÛåÓ precisely what a dulled not always audible Mr. Fox does not possess to the detriment of the evening as a whole.         Instead one is left pondering the relationship between Bruno and his ravenous mother (a throaty  Imogen Stubbs ) who seems to have wandered in from a Tennessee Williams play and the comparative cool brought to proceedings by Christian McKay as the private detective who wises up to events.         Mr. McKay is excellent as is an animated Mr. Huston the latter better-known these days from his work on television (åÛåÏBoardwalk EmpireåÛå) and film (åÛåÏAmerican HustleåÛå). The rest is theatrical pastiche of varying degrees of skill but the train should surely get its own curtain call.          Emil and the Detectives.   Directed by Bijan Sheibani.

And millions of fans have embraced the conceit.         Their passion turned a movie that performed decently at the box office into a catchphrase-spawning sensation on home video and ushered in a new type of smart-silly comedy that in its wake spurred the careers of comedic talents like Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen.

And most notably the commercial production arm of Funny or Die the comedy website founded by Mr. Ferrell and Mr. McKay created dozens of ads in which Burgundy cluelessly shills for the Dodge Durango from Chrysler.

But unlike most people Ms. Thomas 56 a program director for a charitable foundation in Portland Ore. has no monthly bill. All she did was buy a router and rooftop antenna  which not only granted her free access but also made her part owner of the infrastructure that delivers the signal. Total cost: about $150.         Ms. Thomas is a participant in the  Personal Telco Project  one of a growing number of community wireless mesh networks in the United States and abroad. These alternative networks built and maintained by their users are emerging at a time when Internet service providers are limited in number (some argue monopolistic) and are accused of cooperating with government snoops.         åÛåÏI watch friends who have cable and their bills just keep going up and they have no control but feel they are dependent on itåÛå said Ms. Thomas whose husband and two college-age sons also use her homeåÛåªs wireless mesh connection. åÛåÏI feel like there are so many areas of your life that you have no control over and this is a nice piece in which you can.åÛå         A wireless mesh network is essentially a network of a bunch of interconnected wireless routers or nodes which propagate traffic between users and also broadcast broadband service from nodes that are wired to the Internet. Think of it as a system of linked coffee shop hot spots where patrons at all the various coffee shops can send and receive data directly between each otheråÛåªs devices as well as surf the Web. Only you donåÛåªt have to go to a coffee shop and listen to annoying soft jazz to participate.         åÛåÏOur approach is to build our own autonomous system and actually allow people to participate in the Internet rather than participating by proxy through Time Warner Google Fiber or any other retail I.S.P.åÛå said Isaac Wilder executive director of the  Free Network Foundation  which within the last year has managed to construct a wireless mesh network that serves about 500 people in Kansas City Kan.         Perhaps the largest and oldest wireless mesh network is the  Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network  or A.W.M.N. in Greece which was started in 2002 by people frustrated by the slow rollout of broadband in the city. The network now has more than 2500 users throughout the metropolitan area and neighboring islands and offers speeds in some areas in excess of 100 megabits per second compared with the 4 to 7 megabits per second from typical residential cable and DSL connections in the United States         åÛåÏItåÛåªs really fast. But itåÛåªs ended up Internet access doesnåÛåªt matter for many users because the network has its own servicesåÛå said Joseph Bonicioli an information technology professional who is the volunteer president of the association that oversees A.W.M.N. He said the organization had its own search engines Voice over Internet Protocol services as well as åÛåÏforums social activity and content like video.åÛå Some developers have used the networkåÛåªs intranet as a testing ground before taking their concepts and applications live on the Internet.         Community wireless mesh networks åÛåÓ no one tracks how many there are but it is probably in the thousands worldwide åÛåÓ owe their existence to relatively recent advances in wireless technology. A lot of these innovations actually come from radio astronomy where new techniques in compression amplification and error correction have made it possible to receive signals from distant stars planets and probes and are just as effective if not more so terrestrially.         åÛåÏThere have been some really incredible breakthroughs in the past 10 yearsåÛå said Sascha Meinrath director of the  Open Technology Institute  or O.T.I. at the New America Foundation in Washington which has been the nexus for the wireless mesh networking movement through organizing international conferences and funding community projects.         Last month O.T.I. released its  Commotion Construction Kit  which provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up a wireless mesh network using open source code and off-the-shelf routers and antennas. The kit is a synthesis of methods learned from the construction of community mesh networks.         Although available to all O.T.I.åÛåªs focus has been providing the instruction to people living in repressive nations around the world not to mention activists in the United States. Because mesh networks are autonomous from the wider Internet they cannot be shut down by a government. The networks are also harder to surveil because of the way data pinballs unpredictably between nodes without any centralized hub.

My dad is 86 and my mother is about to turn 80. Just because of their age they are at high risk for the disease and I constantly wonder if their forgetfulness is åÛåÏnormalåÛå or a sign of the worst.         All of us are afraid of AlzheimeråÛåªs. We worry about having a parent with it or getting it ourselves. Many believe they would rather die.         It is no wonder we fear the disease. AlzheimeråÛåªs gradually robs its victims of their identities. While many remain happy and unbothered by their forgetfulness they inevitably become different people living largely in whatever part of the past they can remember. Eventually they have to be fed and taken to the bathroom åÛåÓ their existence ever constricting as they drift further and further from their former selves.         The personal effects are devastating but so are the societal ones. In 1980 nearly three million Americans had dementia caused by AlzheimeråÛåªs. That number has since doubled. Some estimates show that in the next 40 years it will increase almost threefold to 16 million. This is because the greatest risk factor for developing AlzheimeråÛåªs dementia is old age and America is rapidly aging. One in nine Americans over 65 have the disease and one in three over 85. This adds up to $200 billion a year in health care costs not counting the tens of billions in unpaid care that families provide.         The costs of the disease along with the uncertainty over both diagnoses and treatments is scary especially for can-do Americans. So itåÛåªs only natural that in recent years people have trumpeted the development of a new test that can measure the presence of beta-amyloid åÛåÓ the protein clumps in the brain that are one of the hallmarks of AlzheimeråÛåªs dementia. The patient is injected with a radioactive molecule that zeros in on beta-amyloid and a positron emission tomography or PET scanner then detects the radioactivity.         In April 2012 the Food and Drug Administration approved Eli LillyåÛåªs radioactive molecule for patients who are being evaluated for AlzheimeråÛåªs disease and other causes of cognitive decline that result in forgetfulness or disorientation.         In September Medicare announced that it would pay for the test åÛåÓ which costs between $3000 and $5000 and is often not covered by private insurance åÛåÓ but only if the patient was part of a randomized controlled trial which is the only way to definitively determine the value of the scan.         Eli Lilly has objected to the ruling contending that the test should be covered without restriction. And the AlzheimeråÛåªs Association a leading research advocacy and patient support organization has posted on its website åÛåÏDespite the concerns and complications we believe it is valuable to the Alzheimer field åÛåÓ to the pursuit of better Alzheimer diagnostics treatments and preventions åÛåÓ to have this product more widely available.åÛå         But the AlzheimeråÛåªs Association isnåÛåªt entirely unbiased. Since 2008 it has received $1.6 million from Lilly. And in 2012 it received more than $4 million from all drug companies åÛåÓ many of which are selling AlzheimeråÛåªs drugs.         The question patients and their families should be asking is what does this test really offer?         LetåÛåªs be clear: it does not cure the disease or affect symptoms. At best it identifies what might be causing a patientåÛåªs forgetfulness. But at worst it can get that diagnosis wrong. According to the companyåÛåªs own post-mortem study of 59 terminally ill patients false positives in scans for the presence of amyloid were reported in up to 3 percent of cases while up to 20 percent of cases resulted in a false negative: patients were diagnosed as not having amyloid and thus AlzheimeråÛåªs even when they did.         To make things more confusing while colloquially called an åÛåÏAlzheimeråÛåªs teståÛå the scan doesnåÛåªt diagnose AlzheimeråÛåªs dementia åÛåÓ it only determines the presence of amyloid. And our understanding of the connection between the two is shaky. While everyone who has AlzheimeråÛåªs also has amyloid not everyone with amyloid has AlzheimeråÛåªs dementia. Almost a third of cognitively normal elderly people have these protein clusters in their brains. On the scan they would light up. But those patients donåÛåªt have AlzheimeråÛåªs dementia and we donåÛåªt know how likely they are to develop it in the future. Imagine the anguish of that error.         In fact the only thing the scan can do is confirm that a patientåÛåªs cognitive problems are  not  caused by AlzheimeråÛåªs.         Even if it could diagnose AlzheimeråÛåªs it probably wouldnåÛåªt make much difference to patients. Currently there are five drugs on the market that treat dementia. None can cure the disease. None can change the downward trajectory of cognition. At best they can relieve the symptoms of patients with moderate to severe AlzheimeråÛåªs for about six to 12 months. And letåÛåªs not forget these drugs all have side effects like fatigue dizziness and pain.         Even those who advocated the general approval of the scan never argued that it would help patients decide whether or not to use medication: these drugs are not preventive; they are taken only by people who already have advanced AlzheimeråÛåªs dementia. As one expert who is collaborating with Lilly put it: åÛåÏHaving an amyloid scan is hugely helpful not in determining drug therapy but for other thingsåÛå åÛåÓ like planning.         But today individuals 55 or younger are likely to live past 80 which means they stand a good chance of getting AlzheimeråÛåªs dementia. We donåÛåªt need an expensive test to tell us that we should all be planning for the possibility of AlzheimeråÛåªs åÛåÓ investing in long-term care insurance exercising and staying socially active.         AlzheimeråÛåªs disease is scary. But that is no reason for society to waste a lot of money on a test that really doesnåÛåªt help.

Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives raised questions about a November 24 deal between Iran and six major powers under which Tehran would restrict its nuclear program in exchange for limited relief from U.S. economic sanctions.         The Obama administration hopes that the interim agreement slated to last six months but renewable for a further six months by mutual consent will provide time to negotiate a final deal with the Iranians within a year.         ""We are asking you to give our negotiators and our experts the time and the space to do their jobs and that includes asking you while we negotiate that you hold off imposing new sanctions"" Kerry told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.         ""I am not saying never ... If this doesn't work we are coming back and asking you for more. I am just saying not right now"" he added. ""This is a very delicate diplomatic moment.""         On Monday Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif was quoted as saying new U.S. sanctions - which the United States promised not to impose in the November 24 agreement - would kill the deal.         ""We are at a crossroads we are at one of those hinge-points in history - one path could lead to an enduring resolution in international communities' concerns about Iran's nuclear program the other path could lead to continued hostility and potentially conflict"" Kerry said.         The Republican House passed a new package of sanctions by a vote of 400 to 20 at the end of July. That bill seeks to cut Iran's oil exports to near zero over the course of a year to try to reduce the flow of funds to the nuclear program.         However the Democratic-led U.S. Senate has moved much more slowly in part at the administration's request and it remains unclear whether Congress may be willing to put the November 24 deal at risk by passing fresh sanctions.         In a sign of bipartisan skepticism over the November 24 agreement Eliot Engel the top Democrat on the House panel told Kerry he thought the administration would have more leverage with more sanctions.         ""I think it could potentially strengthen your hand with a good cop bad cop scenario"" Engel said.         Kerry suggested new sanctions would be seen as an act of bad faith because the United States agreed under the November 24 deal not to impose fresh sanctions. He also said they could undermine the unity of the six major powers who negotiated that deal: Britain China France Germany Russia and the United States.

Exasperated with the refusal of Senate Republicans to confirm many of President ObamaåÛåªs nominees Mr. Reid has been speaking individually with members of his caucus to gauge whether there is enough support to change filibuster rules.         Given how much deference senators have traditionally shown to the rules and procedures of the institution åÛåÓ many of them in place since the 18th century åÛåÓ any modifications are a serious undertaking.         But among Democrats there is a strong consensus that Republicans have gone too far in their latest attempt to block White House appointments by denying Mr. Obama any more judges for what is considered the most important appeals court in the country despite three vacancies.         On Monday they denied him his third pick in less than a month to the court the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. If Mr. Reid determines he has the support he could schedule a vote before Friday an aide who has spoken with him directly said Tuesday.         åÛåÏIf the votes are there we will probably do it this weekåÛå the aide said speaking anonymously to divulge internal plans. A second Democratic aide said Mr. Reid would go ahead once the Senate had wrapped up debate on a contentious proposal to combat sexual assault in the military.         Support has been building in the Democratic caucus to make the change which would most likely affect federal judges and executive branch nominees like cabinet members. It would not affect the minority partyåÛåªs right to filibuster Supreme Court nominees or legislation.         Mr. Reid of Nevada has picked up crucial support from some of his more reluctant members recently. Senator Patrick J. Leahy Democrat of Vermont and the longest-serving member of the Senate today who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee has endorsed putting limits on the filibuster despite his history of being protective of Senate institutions.         The two senators from California Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer said separately on Tuesday that they were leaning toward a rules change.         Their support was seen as crucial because they are both supportive of abortion rights and have been leery of making any changes that could prevent them from standing in the way of an anti-abortion judge.         åÛåÏIåÛåªm for changing the rulesåÛå Ms. Feinstein said emphatically rejecting the argument that she and many other Democrats have made in the past that altering the nature of the filibuster could come back to haunt them.         åÛåÏRepublicans say: åÛå÷Well what goes around comes around. Wait until weåÛåªre in charge.åÛåª I canåÛåªt wait until theyåÛåªre in charge. The moment is nowåÛå she added.         Ms. Feinstein made the same case to her colleagues in a closed-door lunch on Tuesday where Democrats discussed whether they should move forward with a step so controversial it is called the nuclear option.         Separately on Tuesday Ms. Boxer said she was åÛåÏvery openåÛå to a change.         But holdouts within the Democratic caucus remain among those who are worried about a future in which they find themselves powerless to block nominees from a Republican White House. And Mr. Reid can only afford to lose a handful of his 55 members. To change the rules he would need 51 votes.         Conceivably if he could get 50 he could call on Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. åÛåÓ himself a protector of Senate traditions who recently indicated support for a filibuster change åÛåÓ to break the tie but Democrats would rather avoid that possibility.         Asked Tuesday how many votes he thought he had Mr. Reid said åÛåÏWeåÛåªll see.åÛå         There are still many reasons a rules change might not go through not the least of which is that Senate Democrats have gone down this road before only to pull back at the last minute. In July Mr. Reid was threatening to end filibusters on nonjudicial appointments but he relented after Republicans agreed to confirm several nominees they had held up.         Ms. Feinstein said Tuesday that she had hoped Republicans would show more flexibility after the compromise but that had not been the case.         åÛåÏWe left with a very good feeling there would be a new dayåÛå she said. åÛåÏWell the new day lasted maybe for a week.åÛå         The stakes seem higher this time for many Democrats. Many of them strongly believe that if Mr. Obama is not able to appoint any judges to the court åÛåÓ Republicans have rejected four of the five nominees he has submitted åÛåÓ it will retain its conservative bent for decades. It is a crucially important court for any White House because it often decides cases that relate to administration or federal agency policies.         Republicans have proposed permanently removing the three seats that are now vacant arguing that the president would stack an underworked court with judges to his ideological liking. But since that idea has no chance of becoming law their backup plan has been to filibuster any nomination to the court that Mr. Obama sends to the Senate.         Gregory Wawro a professor of political science at Columbia University who has studied use of the filibuster said Republicans were on precarious ground.         åÛåÏWithout passing legislation theyåÛåªre basically trying to change what the structure of the judiciary looks like and I think that sets a dangerous precedentåÛå he said.         åÛåÏHow far do you take this?åÛå he added. åÛåÏDo you not fill these positions because you think you can block a president until you get the White House back?åÛå

Ashtead has raised its forecasts at every announcement for the past eight quarters defying an otherwise volatile construction market with bumper growth.         The London-listed company which hires out diggers and tools on short-term contracts said a turnaround in the U.S. market and a shift by builders towards renting equipment were driving profits.         Pretax profit for the three months to October 31 rose to 112.8 million pounds ($184.8 million) from 78.9 million pounds a year earlier beating analysts' forecasts. Revenue was up 23 percent to 439.2 million pounds.         The market update prompted Jefferies analyst Justin Jordan to upgrade his full-year pretax profit forecast by 4 percent to 342 million pounds.         ""Right now there's a lot of construction out there we're very busy and the statistics have caught up with us"" said Ashtead Chief Executive Geoff Drabble.         Starts in non-residential construction in the United States are up 13 percent this year and forecasts for the U.S. construction market for the next two years are good he said.         Pretax profit at Ashtead's core U.S. brand Sunbelt Rentals which generated more than 90 percent of the group's profit in the second quarter rose by 32 percent.         ""The UK construction market is a little less certain"" Drabble said. ""London is a building site and it feels like we're past the bottom. But the key is for some of the rhetoric in terms of investment infrastructure to come through into hard numbers.""         Ashtead said it had raised its interim dividend by 50 percent to 2.25 pence per share and had increased its full-year capital guidance to 700 million pounds.         It is planning to ramp up investment in new fleet as it anticipates a strong spring next year although Drabble said small ""bolt-on"" acquisitions could account for some of this year's increased capital expenditure.         Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said a strong performance in Tuesday's trading could see Ashtead promoted to the large-cap FTSE100 index on Wednesday.         Ashtead shares were up around 2.3 percent to 730 pence per share at 0935 GMT.         ($1 = 0.6103 British pounds)         (Reporting by Alexander Winning Editing by Kate Holton)        "

A thin and dark-haired woman with a knife-slash smile Rooney Mara bangs and a collection of jersey weeds from Saint Laurent and Rick Owens Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn is at 46 no oneåÛåªs idea of a late bloomer         For well over a decade Ms. Greenberg Rohatyn has been a stealth force in the art world the åÛåÏart bratåÛå daughter of a respected dealer who after her college studies went on to become an independent curator; a private dealer and adviser; a judge in the Bravo reality series åÛåÏ Work of Art: The Next Great Artist åÛå; a widely photographed socialite with a prominent banker husband; a prodigious Democratic fund-raiser; and a proprietor of three increasingly influential galleries with clients from both inside the circles of usual art-world suspects as well as powerful and unexpected outliers like the hip-hop mogul Jay Z.         It is at her  Salon 94  Salon 94 Freemans and Salon 94 Bowery that Ms. Greenberg Rohatyn came into her own showcasing a signature knack for discovering young and emerging artists for kick-starting the reputation of those in midcareer and for engineering unlikely aesthetic mash-ups combining the disparate worlds of fashion sports entertainment and art.         Consider that when during the 2011 Art Basel Miami Beach Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees opened his North Bay Road mansion to a select group of  Art Basel  attendees the witty batting-cage installation by the New York-based sculptor and painter  Nate Lowman  was Ms. Greenberg RohatynåÛåªs inspiration generated out of a visit the ballplayer made to her gallery.         åÛåÏI first came to JeanneåÛåªs uptown space to view several monochrome Richard Prince åÛå÷JokeåÛåª paintingsåÛå Mr. Rodriguez wrote in an email. åÛåÏOur real conversation happened upstairs looking at a Nate Lowman åÛå÷SmileåÛåª painting.åÛå         Having introduced the Yankee to the artist Ms. Greenberg Rohatyn suggested they collaborate. Thus Mr. Lowman åÛåÏtricked out my batting cageåÛå with an array of his obsessive smiley-face paintings Mr. Rodriguez said.         åÛåÏThe Smiles became a stadium audience around the roomåÛå he added. åÛåÏWe joked about me hitting a baseball through one of his bullet-hole paintings hung high on the net.åÛå         When  Jay Z appeared at the Pace Gallery  in Chelsea last summer to film a video for the single åÛåÏPicasso BabyåÛå with a cast of celebrated art-world conscripts it was Ms. Greenberg Rohatyn who subtly and with little fanfare acted as a guiding force.         There she was on a muggy July afternoon discreetly stage-managing as the rapper mesmerized a crowd including the artists Lawrence Weiner Kehinde Wiley and Mickalene Thomas and the philanthropist Agnes Gund. Gliding through the white cube gallery in a one-shouldered Lanvin jumpsuit and with her signature cluster of stone talismans strung from her neck Ms. Greenberg Rohatyn supervised the proceedings darting from improvised green room to curb where she greeted the performance artist Marina Abramovic as she descended from a chauffeured S.U.V. a nutty lunar priestess in a self-induced trance.         åÛåÏThe interesting thing about Jeanne is how involved she is in the åÛå÷becomingåÛåª of an artiståÛåªs creationsåÛå the artist Terry Adkins recently said.         Recruited by Ms. Greenberg Rohatyn and added to her roster after a 10-year absence from the art scene Mr. Adkins found himself emerging from semi-obscurity as a newly minted breakaway star. For the October  Frieze Art Fair  in London Ms. Greenberg Rohatyn installed a cut-down version of Mr. AdkinsåÛåªs totemic åÛåÏMuffled DrumsåÛå a  stacked drum sculpture  paying symbolic homage to the black writer and intellectual W. E. B. Du Bois.         The piece quickly snapped up by the Tate Modern represented an element of political engagement that is Ms. Greenberg RohatynåÛåªs signature. åÛåÏI was really attracted to her in the first place because she had black artists and women and never made a big deal out of itåÛå said  Marilyn Minter  one of the galleryåÛåªs marquee names. In fact her list of artists was never preferential of race or sex yet the range of her interests and connections goes well beyond the confines of an often insular gallery scene.         åÛåÏHow many dealersåÛå Mr. Adkins asked åÛåÏwould even think to collaborate with Jay Z on a video?åÛå How many for that matter could hope to elicit his consent?         On a recent chill evening the crowd for an opening of a jewelry exhibition by the sculptor Alexander Calder at Salon 94 was indicative of the atmosphere Ms. Greenberg Rohatyn specializes in creating one bearing little resemblance to the typical art-world assembly.         Teetering about the room in the townhouse that serves as both gallery and residence for Ms. Greenberg RohatynåÛåªs family Michele Lamy åÛåÓ wife and muse of Mr. Owens the designer åÛåÓ wore vertiginous heelless platform shoes and a gold grille on her teeth. Gareth Pugh the British designer mugged for a camera in a Calder tiara closely watched by a security guard in white cotton gloves.         Bearded and wearing a thigh-high miniskirt the gender-torquing party promoter  Andre J . took snapshots as Fran Lebowitz in a studied Robert Benchley pose held up a wall. Wandering through it all was Ms. Greenberg RohatynåÛåªs daughter Coco one of her three children with Nicolas Rohatyn a financier whose father is the eminent banker Felix Rohatyn best known perhaps for his brinksman role in staving off New York CityåÛåªs bankruptcy in the 1970s.

In 1955 a standard soda at McDonaldåÛåªs was only seven ounces. Today a medium is three times as large and even a childåÛåªs-size version is 12 ounces. ItåÛåªs a widely held view that obesity is a consequence of our behaviors and that behavioral economics thus plays a central role in understanding it åÛåÓ with markets preferences and choices taking center stage. As a behavioral economist I subscribed to that view åÛåÓ until recently when I began to question my thinking.         For many health problems of course behavior plays some role but biology is often a major villain. åÛåÏBiologyåÛå here is my catchall term for the myriad bodily mechanics that are only weakly connected to our choices. A few studies have led me to wonder whether the same is true with obesity. Have I been the proverbial owner of a (behavioral) hammer looking for (behavioral) nails everywhere? Have I failed to appreciate the role of biology?         A first warning sign comes from looking at other animals. Our pets have been getting fatter along with us. In 2012 some 58.3 percent of cats were literally fat cats. That is taken  from a survey  by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention. (The very existence of this organization is telling.) Pet obesity however can easily be tied to human behavior: a culture that eats more probably feeds its animals more too.         And yet a study by a group of biostatisticians in the  Proceedings of the Royal Society  challenges this interpretation. They collected data from animals raised in captivity: macaques marmosets chimpanzees vervets lab rats and mice. The data came from labs and centers and spanned several decades. These captive animals are also becoming fatter: weight gain for female lab mice for example came out to 11.8 percent a decade from 1982 to 2003.         But this weight gain is harder to explain. Captive animals are fed carefully controlled diets which the researchers argue have not changed for decades. Animal obesity cannot be explained through eating behavior alone. We must look to some other åÛåÓ biological åÛåÓ driver.         Fittingly the study is titled åÛåÏCanaries in the Coal Mine.åÛå Could our inability to explain animal obesity with behavior be a warning sign? Perhaps we are also overlooking biological drivers for human obesity. But what might these culprits be?         A particularly interesting candidate resides in your gut. Your digestive system is actually a complex ecosystem playing host to hundreds of species of bacteria that do things as diverse as fermenting undigested  carbohydrates  and providing  vitamins . They also regulate how much fat your body stores.         Not everyone however has the same gut bacteria. And interestingly the composition of this bacteria correlates with obesity. Of course this relationship could be simple: the obese eat differently and therefore they have different bacteria.         But a  recent study  in the journal Science showed that cause and effect could go the other way as well. Researchers harvested bacteria from pairs of human twins where one twin was obese and the other was not. Then they transplanted these bacteria into mice. The mice who received bacteria from the obese twin gained weight while the others did not. The mice did not eat more: Their metabolism changed so that they put on more weight even with the same caloric input.         What then determines your gut bacteria? It could be  antibiotics  or environmental toxins or how processed your food is. Another possibility is raised by a study in The New England Journal of Medicine   that shows  that obesity seems to åÛåÏspreadåÛå across social networks with people infecting their friends and neighbors. I had always assumed that was because birds of a feather flock together åÛåÓ and that is surely part of the explanation.ÌâåÊBut because gut bacteria can also spread among people in close proximity perhaps the obesity epidemic really is well an epidemic?         IåÛåªm not arguing that behavior does not matter. Biology and behavior often interact; the spread of  flu  depends on whether we wash our hands. Similarly the bacteria study found that the åÛåÏobese gut bacteriaåÛå had an impact only when the mice were fed diets heavy in saturated fats.         Perhaps most interestingly changing biology may even be changing cravings. Some biologists have hypothesized that our gut bacteria actually drive cravings for certain unhealthy foods. A focus on biology doesnåÛåªt mean a reduced emphasis on behavior just a richer understanding of it.         These and other studies raise important possibilities which deserve more research and attention. At the very least we should invest as many obesity research dollars in uncovering and understanding these biological channels as we do in understanding behavioral channels. And this is a behavioral economist talking!         After all this could radically change the way we think about policies to curb obesity. As one newspaper editorial pronounced:         åÛåÏA little town in Sweden has put a local tax on fat men. It is declared that åÛå÷the fat man stands accused by the very fact of his too solid fleshåÛåª (vide åÛåÏHamletåÛå) åÛå÷of gluttony and laziness.åÛåª Millions of fat men throughout the world may rise up and denounce as liars the town councillor who drew up this cruel indictment and those who voted for it but the gentler way of reproving them would be to point out the tritely recognised danger of generalisation in almost any statement of supposed fact. Not all fat men are lazy and gluttonous. Obesity is in many a congenital habit of body; in others a disease.åÛå          That editorial  was written in 1923 for the paper known as The Paris Herald. Maybe the writer was on to something.

I was actually sitting in my office using Microsoft‰Ûªs latest update to Photosynth on my computer a sophisticated technology that stitches together overlapping photos into an interactive panorama. While online panoramas have been available for years the new  updates to Photosynth  which will be available on a first-come first-serve basisåÊTuesday can now create panoramas that are hyper-detailed and actually look 3-D. How 3-D? Seeing Mount Everest on my computer was one of those oh-wow-how-did-they-make-this moments. Microsoft said it is able to make the 3-D panorama look so realistic by actually creating a sort-of 3-D model of a photo using proprietary algorithms then taking high-resolutions photos and layering them on top of each other. The company‰Ûªs latest updates also make panoramas much smoother and speedier ‰ÛÓ they could sometimes be jittery in the earlier versions of the software. The new software shows images almost like a high-resolution video that is fully interactive. Swiping your mouse up will move you forward on the screen; swiping down will smoothly bring you backwards through an image. The images are incredibly detailed too. The Mount Everest Photosynth demo was shot byåÊDavid Brashears a mountaineer and is made up of 177 differentåÊ60-megapixel photos. Microsoft says this resolution allows the panorama to play like a video that isåÊ30 times more detailed than an HDTV signal. David Gedye lead program manager at MicrosoftåÊsaid that while there is an artistic goal to offer people software that makes these types of images there is also a business reason behind the software. ‰ÛÏAt Microsoft we‰Ûªve long had a goal of documenting the important places in the world and sharing them on Bing‰Û he said in a phone interview referring to the company‰Ûªs search engine.åÊ‰ÛWe don‰Ûªt need to drive trucks or employ people to capture the world we can work with enthusiasts who take these pictures‰Û and then stitch them all together in a highly immersive way. Mr. GedyeåÊsaid that adding these images to Microsoft‰Ûªs search features including Bing search and its mapping software makes a more compelling offering for users who are searching through Microsoft products. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs about giving this power to Bing to make it a place where things are really presented beautifully and in a place where it‰Ûªs immersive and interactive‰Û he said.åÊPeople can also use the updated software to document their own objects or places that can be embedded on a personal website. The new software does not work on iPads or smartphones that don‰Ûªt supportåÊWebGL a JavaScript 3-D rendering engine. But Microsoft said it is working on updates that will enable the software or a variation of it on these platforms. The company also plans to add updates to Photosynth apps that allow people to create these immersive images on their smartphones. Until then users will have to upload an array of photos to the Photosynth website to be turned into an interactive 3-D space.

This is the first time the European Union executive has ever taken such a step said Joost Korte the EC deputy director general for enlargement.         ""Don't underestimate the political consequences of this"" Korte told a news conference in Sarajevo. ""These are clear signals to the leadership of this country that there is a consequence for failure to act.""         The EU will cut this year's funding by 45 million euros ($62 million) and may also suspend a 2014-2020 funding package because rival ethnic leaders have failed to reach a deal to remove discriminatory provisions from the constitution after two months of intensive negotiations.         The agreement on how to allow minority groups to run for top offices harmonising the constitution with a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights from 2009 was an essential condition for Bosnia to apply for EU membership this year.         ""We are stuck with Bosnia-Herzegovina sadly. There is no progress here"" Korte said adding that unless the authorities put more effort into reaching a deal the EU would no longer be able to work with them.         Bosnia has been governed along ethnic lines since the 1992-9 war in which an estimated 100000 people died. The country has split into two autonomous regions the Serb Republic and the Federation dominated by Bosniaks and Croats.         After four years of negotiations efforts to change the constitution have fallen hostage to political bargaining in particular a push by Bosnia's Croats to win greater protection of their rights.         Korte said Bosnia also risked losing around a half billion euros in EU pre-accession funds over the next seven years because leaders could not agree on how to distribute the funds.         Bosnia trails other former Yugoslav republics on the path to EU entry. Of its immediate neighbours Croatia joined the EU in July Montenegro has begun accession talks and Serbia expects to start by January.         Analysts say parliamentary election scheduled for October 2014 will impede any progress on passing EU tests this year.

Those infractions bring automatic fines of $2000 each.         åÛåÏNormally you donåÛåªt have that many early in the season then around the holiday season you get more then as you get down near the playoffs you get moreåÛå said Rod Thorn the N.B.A.åÛåªs president for basketball operations. åÛåÏThis year itåÛåªs started early.åÛå         The leagueåÛåªs disciplinary binge reflected what appears to be a growing impulse in the N.B.A. and the other sports leagues. Fines in American sports have become a fact of life like a charge at a tollbooth.         Jason Terry a Nets guard noted that there were just more ways to get in trouble now than when he entered the N.B.A. 14 years ago.         åÛåÏSocial media dress code standing up during the game uniform regulations åÛåÓ itåÛåªs the letter of the law around here and we donåÛåªt have much say in itåÛå he said.         There is a debate about how much fines affect players. A $5000 fine for a player making $2690875 the median N.B.A. salary this season would be roughly proportional to a $95 penalty for someone making $50895 the median New York City household income last year.         The city issues a $95 fine for illegally parking your car in a truck-loading zone åÛåÓ enough money to spoil a morning but probably not an entire day.         Still Thorn said the results speak for themselves. He rejoined the league this season åÛåÓ after over a decade working in team front offices åÛåÓ to be its chief disciplinarian. He held the same job from 1986 to 2000. He said that fighting had decreased drastically since his first time and that every rule adopted in his absence had seemed to take hold.         åÛåÏNo one likes to lose moneyåÛå Thorn said.         The N.B.A. instituted a rule last season that results in a $5000 fine the second time a player is caught flopping or faking contact to draw a foul. The rule has snared some of the biggest stars including LeBron James of the Miami Heat and James Harden of the Houston Rockets who was given a $5000 fine last month. It has not been popular among players to say the least.         åÛåÏFine somebody $5000 for jaywalking or somethingåÛå Terry said. åÛåÏFive thousand for something on a basketball court? ThatåÛåªs a little much to me.åÛå         Terry may not know that New Yorkers view jaywalking as an inalienable human right. But his sentiment stands reflecting that players do care about the fines.         Two players were fined $25000 last month for inappropriate Twitter messages. Mike Woodson the KnicksåÛåª coach was fined the same amount for criticizing referees during a radio interview. Two players were fined $15000 early in November for a popular celebration that has been deemed obscene by the league. Another was fined $10000 for cursing in a postgame interview.         Some players think these amounts should correspond more closely with individual salaries. A rookie making the minimum $490180 is affected differently from Kobe Bryant who has a league-high $30453000 salary this season. (A player does lose a 110th of his salary for each game he is suspended.)         Fines issued during the season are withdrawn directly from a playeråÛåªs paycheck. For fines issued in the off-season players are asked to write a check to the league. Once collected the money is divided between the league and the players union and the two organizations donate their shares to charitable causes.

The countdown had begun and he prepared to dive into DeanåÛåªs Blue Hole hoping to reach 72 meters on a single inhalation with no fins or supplemental oxygen. He began sipping the air attempting to pack as much oxygen in his lungs as possible.         At 12:25 p.m. Sunday surrounded by 15 other athletes and observers as well as five safety divers he turned and submerged face first and looking like a human arrow shooting into the darkness on what would be the last dive of his life.         Officials for Vertical Blue a  championship event  in the sport of free diving monitored and announced MevoliåÛåªs progress by sonar and all was progressing smoothly until he had trouble at 68 meters or about 223 feet and seemed to turn back. Yet instead of heading to the surface he decided to dive down again in an attempt to reach his goal and achieve his second American record. A few of his fellow athletes squirmed with discomfort recognizing that his decision was a dangerous one.         åÛåÏDiving to that depth with no fins thatåÛåªs a hard physical diveåÛå said Mike Board the British record-holder. åÛåÏI was thinking O.K. heåÛåªs going to have a hard time getting up.åÛå         Still Mevoli shot to the surface under his own power after a dive of 3 minutes 38 seconds. ThatåÛåªs when the scene turned nightmarish.         Mevoli ripped off his goggles flashed the O.K. sign and attempted to complete the surface protocol that would make his attempt official by saying åÛåÏI am O.K.åÛå But he wasnåÛåªt. His words were garbled his eyes wide and blank. He tipped backward into the ocean and lost consciousness which while alarming is not unheard-of in a sport in which almost all the top athletes have lost consciousness at one time or another though usually for only a few seconds. Mevoli was not so fortunate.         Five safety divers one of them an Australian paramedic and all certified in life support techniques hefted him onto a nearby platform where the event physician Barbara Jeschke of Germany went to work trying to revive him.         åÛåÏThereåÛåªs a problem with his lungåÛå shouted Marco Cosentino of Italy one of the safety divers who meet the competitors at various stages to help bring them to the surface if they are in distress. They turned Mevoli onto his side and blood began pouring from his mouth and pooling on the platform before dissipating into the sea.         At first there was a pulse at times faint at times strong. Within 15 minutes there was none. The team cut off his wetsuit and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation in earnest. Attempts to revive Mevoli which included three shots of adrenaline at the scene continued unsuccessfully for the next 90 minutes.         Mevoli 32 from Williamsburg Brooklyn was a relative newcomer to the sport. When he dived to 100 meters in May he became the first American to break that barrier unassisted. He used a monofin that day and completed the feat in 3:45. It is this type of free diving åÛåÓ rather than the variety known as variable weight which uses a sled to take divers deeper than they could ever get on their own åÛåÓ that has exploded in popularity in recent years. Internationally free-diving schools are multiplying in destinations as wide-ranging as Hawaii Egypt Indonesia Greece and the Bahamas.         Vertical Blue considered the Wimbledon of free diving is an annual event that attracts the sportåÛåªs top athletes. It is held in a unique arena: DeanåÛåªs Blue Hole a narrow 200-meter-deep limestone pit the deepest of its kind in the world. It is set in a cove backed by cliffs that spill into a turquoise bay. The bay laps the shore of an egg noodle of an island that is 72 miles long home to 4000 people and under the tourism radar.         This year 34 athletes came to compete representing 16 countries with 26 national records set in the first six days of a competition that was scheduled to end on Tuesday. Athletes compete in  three categories : Constant Weight (in which divers dolphin-kick to depth wearing a monofin) Free Immersion (in which athletes pull themselves along a rope down to depth and back to the surface again without wearing fins); and the most difficult event the one that Mevoli attempted Sunday Constant Weight Without Fins (where competitors dive without fins at all).

Fed chief Ben Bernanke shocked emerging markets in May when he raised the possibility that the U.S. central bank could soon embark on a draw-down in its $85 billion (Ìâå£51.74 billion) a month bond-buying program known as  quantitative easing .         ""If the tapering happens over a longer period of time gradually - which is what we would expect - ... we think that the emerging economies especially in the poor countries can adjust"" Kim told reporters after speaking at the Economic Club of Washington.         The World Bank focuses on helping developing countries grow and fight poverty. Kim last month said that emerging markets had seen about a third of the overall increase in interest rates likely to come as the Fed tapers.         The Fed surprised financial markets again in September by opting not to reduce its $85 billion per month bond-buying pace. But economists think signs of vigour in the U.S. job market will lead the central bank to make a move to trim asset purchases by early next year.         Kim defended Bernanke's decision to talk about the Fed's withdrawal from monetary stimulus in May long before it would happen which roiled markets and raised questions about the effectiveness of Fed communications.         ""We feel he did exactly the right thing by communicating in advance that it could happen"" Kim said.         (Reporting by Anna Yukhananov; Editing by James Dalgleish and Meredith Mazzilli)        "

Snowden it has met with government agencies in Britain and the United States more than 100 times and has been subjected to measures åÛåÏdesigned to intimidate.åÛå         The testimony by the editor Alan Rusbridger gave a public airing to the debate over how to balance press freedom against national security concerns an issue that became more acute once The Guardian began publishing material leaked by Mr. Snowden in June.         The American and British governments have said the disclosures which detail how the National Security Agency and its equivalent in Britain Government Communication Headquarters gather vast amounts of data damage national security and help hostile governments. Journalists and transparency advocates have countered that the leak spurred a vital debate on privacy and the role of spy agencies in the Internet age.         Mr. Rusbridger said Tuesday that the governmentsåÛåª measures åÛåÏinclude prior restraintåÛå as well as visits by officials to his office the enforced destruction of Guardian computer disks with power tools and repeated calls from lawmakers åÛåÏasking police to prosecuteåÛå The Guardian for disclosing the classified material in news articles.         As he testified before a Parliamentary committee on national security he faced aggressive questioning from lawmakers particularly those of the ruling Conservative Party. Some asserted that The Guardian had handled the material irresponsibly putting it at risk of interception by hostile governments and others. Others said the paper had jeopardized national security.         At one point during the hearing Mr. Rusbridger was asked to his evident surprise whether he loved his country. He answered yes noting that he valued its democracy and free press. After Mr. RusbridgeråÛåªs testimony a senior British police officer Cressida Dick refused to rule out prosecutions as part of an investigation into the matter.         Since the revelations newspapers particularly those that have dealt with Mr. SnowdenåÛåªs material have also had to adjust to a harsh new reporting environment security experts and journalists said as governments and others seek secret material held by reporters.         åÛåÏThe old model was kind of like your houseåÛå said Marc Frons the chief information officer of The New York Times. åÛåÏYou locked your front door and windows but not your desk drawer even if it had your passport inside. In the new model you have locks on everything.åÛå         The Guardian The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal declined to comment about internal security arrangements.         But Mr. Rusbridger told Parliament that the newspaper åÛåÏwent to more precautions over this material than any other story we have ever handled.åÛå         Senior Guardian editors were initially skeptical this year when asked to hand over their cellphones before discussing Mr. SnowdenåÛåªs documents said a person with knowledge of the reporting process who did not want to be named discussing confidential security procedures.         That soon changed when they reviewed the information Mr. Snowden had supplied this person said. The documents they came to realize would be of intense interest not only to the American and British governments from which they were taken but also to other governments like China and Russia seeking an espionage edge and hackers seeking to embarrass either government agencies or the publications reporting on the material.         Eventually the same editors insisted that meetings be held in rooms without windows and that any electronic devices nearby be unplugged. Computers that contained the information could never be connected to the Internet. And reporters who needed to consult with colleagues in other countries about the documents had to fly them over physically and meet in person despite the extra costs. On one occasion Mr. Rusbridger said encrypted documents were sent via FedEx.         Nicholas Weaver a computer security researcher at the University of California Berkeley said effective countermeasures for all reporters covering such issues begin with first contact with a source.         Devices åÛåÏleave fingerprints everywhere you goåÛå he said. åÛåÏLeave all your high-tech gadgets at home; meet in a public location thatåÛåªs kind of noisy and wear a hat so you donåÛåªt get caught on camera.åÛå         åÛåÏYou have to walk there because we have this network of license plate readers nowåÛå he said or buy a transit ticket with cash and dispose of it afterward. As for making first contact with a sensitive source Mr. Weaver said åÛåÏYou have to wait for them to contact you.åÛå         Communicating with existing sources said Ashkan Soltani a security expert and reporter who has worked with The Guardian The Journal and The Post should be done on a computer isolated from all other åÛåÏpromiscuous communicationsåÛå like web browsing and downloading files to avoid the secret installation of software to monitor activity.         åÛåÏIf the computers have malware no amount of secure email no amount of encryption is going to helpåÛå he said.         The threat is not abstract: Several news organizations have been victimized by hacking in recent years. In 2012 Chinese hackers infiltrated The New York TimesåÛåªs systems seeking access to reportersåÛåª inboxes.         The United States government too seeks access to email information involving news organizations. Several secret subpoenas to companies like Google for data related to accounts linked with WikiLeaks have surfaced.         But those briefed on security plans and several recent reports suggest that tech companies are also trying to resist the governmentåÛåªs drive for information.

Depending on your rooting interest that is bad news or good news.         It is bad news for those who think the Hall of Fame is the proper place for a person who is widely considered one of three or four men who have had the greatest impact on baseball history. Another of the three is Babe Ruth and the third is Jackie Robinson or as I believe Branch Rickey although those two men are obviously linked in their successful effort to break baseballåÛåªs color barrier.         As for Miller the founding executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association he led his constituents to the land of rights and riches. In so doing he helped create a system that has also enriched the owners. With annual revenue in the industry now at $8.5 billion even the sportåÛåªs commissioner Bud Selig has stated that Miller who died in November 2012 belongs in Cooperstown.         Not that SeligåÛåªs endorsement has done any good. Tired of the HallåÛåªs continued snubs åÛåÓ he called the voting rigged åÛåÓ Miller in 2007 requested that his name no longer be placed on the ballot.         He came to that decision after the third rejection and at the time asked me how to go about communicating his desire to the appropriate people. I sympathized with the way he felt and suggested he write a letter to the Baseball Writers Association of America whose historical overview committee draws up the veterans ballots.         But the letter did not achieve his goal and Miller has returned to the ballot three more times since then losing in each instance of course.         MilleråÛåªs latest loss however insulting to his many supporters can also be considered good news to those who thought his desire to get off the ballot should be honored. From their point of view this latest voting result only proved his point         Peter Miller MarvinåÛåªs son recently sent me an email in which he wrote: åÛåÏMy fatheråÛåªs wishes stated in writing and reaffirmed to me in person many times and for the last time within weeks of his death were that he did not want to be on the H.O.F. ballot.åÛå         The Hall did not disclose the number of votes Miller received from the 16-man committee this time. The only results it announced were the unanimous votes for the former managers Bobby Cox Tony La Russa and Joe Torre. The nine other candidates the Hall said received six or fewer votes.         Which is curious in itself. In 2010 Miller received 11 votes missing election by just one vote. In 2009 he received seven when nine were needed.         Back in 2007 Miller got just three votes from the 12-man committee that elected Bowie Kuhn a former commissioner. That result attracted ridicule because Kuhn was never a match for Miller in tough labor negotiations more often than not had disciplinary actions overturned and was generally a reactionary commissioner who was as responsible as anyone in allowing the ruling that created free agency.         Still Kuhn is in the Hall of Fame and Miller is not.         Some people thought Miller would be elected this time because the owners who exercise significant influence on the Hall did not have to fear what he might say at next JulyåÛåªs induction ceremony.         But maybe the concern of some owners outlives Miller himself though it is unclear why his vote total fell from 11 to no more than six unless some voters have actually come to honor his desire not to be on the ballot and voted as if he were not.         åÛåÏDespite the election resultsåÛå said Tony Clark the newly elected head of the union åÛåÏMarvinåÛåªs legacy remains intact and will only grow stronger while the credibility of the Hall of Fame continues to suffer.åÛå         Which is just praise for Miller. But again there is no plaque.

Sunday night  on ‰ÛÏ60 Minutes‰Û Mr. Bezos  the Amazon founder floated the notion of using drones to deliver packages. He showed Charlie Rose a video of a tiny helicopter seizing a package from a warehouse and airlifting it to a house. The drone then took off again. Amazon has already named  its future delivery system  Prime Air. ‰ÛÏI know this looks like science fiction‰Û Mr. Bezos said. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs not.‰Û Still even the hyper-optimistic Mr. Bezos cautioned that there were ‰ÛÏyears of additional work from this point.‰Û He told the show the hardest challenge would be convincing the Federal Aviation Administration that this is a good idea. Well the F.A.A. and everyone else. The commercial use of drones was legalized early in 2012 but there has been a good deal of outcry about drones possibly being used for surveillance. Some communities are banning local police from using drones. How receptive they would be to e-commerce applications is unclear. An Amazon promotional page  for Prime Air however said the delivery system was practically a done deal. ‰ÛÏFrom a technology point of view we‰Ûªll be ready to enter commercial operations as soon as the necessary regulations are in place‰Û the company said. It said that could be two years away. No mention was made of what would happen if you live in an apartment. Or whether you would get your money back if your neighbor shot down your delivery. Or as Mr. Bezos said:  ‰ÛÏThe hard part here is putting in all the redundancy all the reliability all the systems you need to say ‰Û÷Look this thing can‰Ûªt land on somebody‰Ûªs head while they‰Ûªre walking around their neighborhood.‰Ûª‰Û He later added ‰ÛÏThat‰Ûªs not good.‰Û If Amazon could do it so presumably could Walmart and the many other retailers trying to do same-day delivery.

The Justice Department is looking into allegations that the company Inchcape Shipping Services with the help of subcontractors overcharged the Navy by millions of dollars interviews and previously undisclosed court documents show.         Inchcape which is owned by the government of Dubai was suspended this week from winning new federal contracts and is expected to meet with Justice Department officials soon to discuss the case.         The civil fraud investigation which was prompted by a whistle-blower who had worked for the company is another serious embarrassment for the Navy which is already grappling with a criminal investigation of its main ship supplier in the Pacific Glenn Defense Marine Asia.         The firmåÛåªs owner  Leonard Glenn Francis  was arrested in September on charges of conspiring to bribe Navy officials with cash trips and prostitutes. In exchange investigators say those officials helped divert ships to certain ports where Glenn Defense submitted inflated bills. Three Navy officials have been charged with crimes and four others including two admirals have been suspended over their ties to Mr. Francis.         åÛåÏItåÛåªs like finding a couple of cockroaches in the kitchen when you turn on the lightåÛå said Charles Tiefer a former member of the federal Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. åÛåÏThis suggests that this area of contracting is infested with problems including a lack of competition overbilling and resistance to government investigations.åÛå         Investigators accuse Inchcape of a different scheme: that it paid commissions to subcontractors willing to give large discounts then pocketed the difference instead of refunding it to the Navy.         A federal subpoena issued in March 2011 demanded that Inchcape turn over its records involving Navy ships and any discounts or rebates from subcontractors since 2002 court records show.         A Justice Department lawyer later sent the company an email saying investigators were especially concerned about its deals in supplying six aircraft carriers and four other ships from 2005 through 2009 and about its charges for fuel in Peru and for removing waste from ships in Bahrain Dubai and South Africa. The email which was included in court records asked the company for a spreadsheet listing what the suppliers charged Inchcape what it charged the Navy and the companyåÛåªs profit margin for those and other port visits.         As was the case with Glenn Defense contracting experts say the Navy ignored warning signs about InchcapeåÛåªs questionable practices.         Records show that the Naval Supply Systems Command extended InchcapeåÛåªs largest contract seven times since 2010 when the Justice Department began investigating the whistle-bloweråÛåªs allegations. The company has won at least $257 million for work in the Middle East under the contract. Since 2010 the Navy has awarded the firm at least eight other contracts estimated at more than $41 million including three this year.         The Navy said it suspended Inchcape this week after finding åÛåÏevidence of conduct indicating questionable business integrity.åÛå Rear Adm. John F. Kirby the NavyåÛåªs chief spokesman cited significant overpayments to Inchcape and åÛåÏconduct so seriousåÛå that it warranted the suspension. Inchcape can keep its contracts while suspended but cannot win new orders without special agency approval.         Sheila Armstrong head of corporate communications for Inchcape said in an email that the Justice Department investigation and the suspension involved åÛåÏa small number of Navy ships between 2005 and 2008.åÛå The company has been discussing its billings for that work with the Justice Department åÛåÏwith a view to bringing this matter to a conclusionåÛå she said.         She also said that the company had conducted an åÛåÏindependent audit into its billing processes in 2009 and believes that this provided full answers to all of the questions raised.åÛå         Under federal rules suspensions which are rare among major contractors are not intended to punish firms for past deeds only for continuing problems.         The governmentåÛåªs subpoena in 2011 also asked Inchcape for documents about any entertainment gifts cameras and cellphones it had provided to Defense Department employees.         Such gifts were a major part of Mr. FrancisåÛåªs case but Admiral Kirby said there were åÛåÏno indications right nowåÛå of wrongdoing by naval officers in the Inchcape case.

Sarah Moser a program director for a fundraising organization in San Francisco is planning to host her first Thanksgiving meal. It will feature sweet potato latkes with cranberry applesauce from her mom Blair and a key lime pie with a matzoh crust. It‰Ûªs a not-so-traditional menu but it is fitting because this year cranberry sauce and menorahs are joining together for the rare convergence of Thanksgiving and Hanukkah which  some are cleverly marketing as ‰ÛÏThanksgivukah.‰Û  Next Thursday on the second night of Hanukkah Jews across the United States will be lighting menorahs after their feasts playing the dreidel game between forkfuls of pumpkin pie and exchanging gifts after the football game is over.  ‰ÛÏI don‰Ûªt even like Thanksgiving that much but this year it‰Ûªs just plain fun‰Û said Ms. Moser. Samantha Ettus who writes about parenting and working mothers from Los Angeles plans to celebrate the convergence of the holidays by making charitable gifts that day in her children‰Ûªs name in lieu of tangible presents. They will consist of donations to a children‰Ûªs entrepreneurship organization for her 7-year-old daughter an arts-based charity for her 6-year-old daughter and a book-giving charity for her 3-year-old son.  ‰ÛÏThe jury is still out to see if my 3-year-old will appreciate it‰Û she said.  The last time the two holidays overlapped was in 1918 when Jews lit one menorah candle on Thanksgiving night and it won‰Ûªt happen again until Nov. 27 2070. So whether it is a Jewish twist on a Thanksgiving standby or adding some fall flavors to your Hanukkah menu now is the time to create memories that can last the next 57 years. Paula Shoyer author of ‰ÛÏThe Holiday Kosher Baker‰Û is using the occasion as an excuse to get extra creative at her holiday table. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs fun to experiment and see what works what‰Ûªs too silly and what‰Ûªs truly delicious‰Û she said.  On Hanukkah is it customary to eat foods fried in oil to commemorate the historical event when the Jews won their land back in battle. After their victory they wanted to rededicate their temple but only had enough oil to burn for one day. However that small bit of oil miraculously lasted for eight days.  For her table which she plans to decorate with a blue and orange color scheme to bring both the Hanukkah and Thanksgiving colors to the forefront Ms. Shoyer is planning a traditional Thanksgiving meal complemented by both plain potato latkes and sweet potato latkes. ‰ÛÏGod gave me one day to eat fried foods so I‰Ûªm going to use it‰Û she said. She also recommends apple latkes a light twist on the potato latke that can be served as a side dish or dessert and also plans to serve pumpkin donuts and maybe some pumpkin churros. For those looking to avoid excess oil Ms. Shoyer has also created a chocolate cranberry mandelbread.  She is looking forward to using the converging holidays as an opportunity to have a thematic conversation with her family. ‰ÛÏIt will be nice to talk with my children about being Jewish Americans and the rewards and challenges of it‰Û she said. Ms. Moser will set her table with place settings for her 15 or so guests accompanied by packages of chocolate Hanukkah gelt. And her cake will be accessorized with 40 Hanukkah candles. Did Ms. Moser forget to mention that Thanksgivukkah is also her birthday?  ‰ÛÏIf anyone wants to bring me gifts they are more than welcome‰Û she said.

This may not sound like alarming news but unless we take steps to prevent its spread this animal is poised to disrupt the ecology of the Hudson River and New YorkåÛåªs other inland waters.         Grass carp are like underwater lawn mowers. They reach nearly five feet in length and 100 pounds in weight and are so efficient at consuming vegetation that they have been stocked all over the world as åÛåÏbiocontrolsåÛå for problematic weeds. But as with so many misguided introductions the grass carp will spread out of control. Now that they are in Lake Erie it is just a matter of time before they swim east to the Hudson River along the Erie Canal.         In the Hudson River aquatic vegetation helps underpin the food chain and provides essential habitat to fish and wildlife. About half of the riveråÛåªs original aquatic vegetation was destroyed during the 19th and early 20th centuries by dredging and filling to improve the shipping channel and the vegetation that remains faces serious threats from storms and the rising sea level. The establishment of a large population of grass carp a fish that flourishes in large turbid rivers like the Hudson could further endanger this habitat and decimate the riveråÛåªs already embattled native fishes.         More than just the Hudson is threatened. Similar problems could occur in other waters along the course of the Erie Canal including the Finger Lakes and Oneida Lake which also contain valuable beds of aquatic plants.         This has happened before. In 1986 Eurasian zebra mussels first appeared in the United States in Lake Erie having been transported inadvertently in the ballast water of commercial vessels. The zebra mussels spread quickly and in 1991 they were discovered in the Hudson. Just one year later it was estimated that 550  billion  zebra mussels inhabited the river. This eruption of zebra mussels disrupted the workings of the riveråÛåªs ecosystem depleting the phytoplankton at the base of the food chain by more than 75 percent and cutting populations of its fish by as much as 60 percent.         The grass carp is not the only new invader waiting to use the Erie Canal. Two other Asian carp species now swimming into the Great Lakes through the Chicago Canal are likely to use the Erie Canal as they move east to the Hudson where their appetite for plankton will threaten the food supply of what remains of the once huge shad population in the river. In coming decades many other potentially harmful species that have arrived through purposeful or accidental introduction are positioned to use the Erie Canal and cause problems for New YorkåÛåªs lakes and rivers.         Fortunately there still is time to stop the grass carp from invading the inland waters of New York. One solution would be to recreate the natural barrier between Lake Erie and the Hudson River by building a barricade along the Erie Canal that would allow essential canal operations like recreational boat passage while impeding the movement of invaders.         Various types of such barriers have been proposed or installed on canals around the world. This has involved replacing traditional canal locks with hoist or rail systems chemical or electric barriers or bubble screens (which deploy a thick wall of air bubbles that impede the movement of mobile creatures). The barrier best suited to the Erie Canal should be determined by a study of alternatives that considers their costs compatibility with canal operations and effectiveness against invasive species.         Now is the time to perform such a study. Too often people consider canal barriers only in a crisis when an invader is already in the process of moving through the canal. Such delayed crisis planning often leads to hurried and flawed designs wasteful spending and ineffective control of invaders.         Led by groups like the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the United States Army Corps of Engineers and with the assistance of other conservation organizations and scientists we need to develop and implement a plan that maximizes the benefits that the Erie Canal can provide to New York while minimizing the risks from the spread of the grass carp and other harmful invaders. The zebra mussel has demonstrated how much ecological damage one species can cause and the growing international record shows that invasive species are rarely eradicated once established.         We must do this now before the carp take this decision out of our hands.

The interim agreement is for six months but it can be renewed for an additional six months by mutual consent. The goal is to buy time so that a more sweeping agreement can be negotiated. The interim agreement also outlines some of the provisions of such a follow-on agreement saying that Iran could continue to enrich uranium åÛåÏunder mutually agreed parametersåÛå and under åÛåÏenhanced monitoring.åÛå         Mr. Kerry said to the panel that he did not know if a comprehensive agreement could be achieved but that the United States had an obligation to try. And seeking to defuse the congressional push for additional sanctions he said that imposing new penalties at this point would poison the atmosphere for such talks.         åÛåÏWe have an obligation to give these negotiations an opportunity to succeedåÛå Mr. Kerry said.         Trying to reassure the lawmakers Mr. Kerry said that the scope of any future Iranian enrichment activity under a comprehensive agreement would need to be åÛåÏmutually agreedåÛå and would be linked to legitimate civilian needs.         But the six-month interim agreement Mr. Kerry asserted was also in the best interest of the United States because it halted important elements of IranåÛåªs program.         åÛåÏThe national security of the United States is stronger under this first-step agreement than it was beforeåÛå said Mr. Kerry who asserted that Israel and Persian Gulf Arab states were also more secure.         Mr. Kerry promised that the Obama administration would go to Congress for tougher sanctions if the effort to negotiate a comprehensive nuclear accord with Iran faltered. åÛåÏWe are committed to asking you for additional sanctions if we failåÛå Mr. Kerry said. åÛåÏWe will need them.åÛå

Under the watch of  Melissa Smey  the theateråÛåªs executive director since 2009 Miller has devoted considerable resources to presenting music by female composers both established and emerging åÛåÓ and has done so with a lack of fanfare that characterizes the initiative as no anomaly but simply business as usual.         Ms. Smey welcoming the audience from the stage said that Ms. Thorvaldsdottir had been on her wish list for several years. That statement underscored Ms. SmeyåÛåªs agile reflexes: Ms. Thorvaldsdottir now 36 is just starting to establish an international profile. Born and initially schooled in Iceland she completed her training at the University of California San Diego in 2011.  åÛåÏRhizomaåÛå  her ear-opening debut CD came out that same year.         Anyone wondering how Jack MilleråÛåªs Tractor of Schoharie N.Y. earned a citation in the program was quickly enlightened during åÛåÏinto åÛåÓ second selfåÛå which opened the concert. With hisses murmurs and thumps resounding from French-horn players trombonists and percussionists positioned throughout the theater one performer Matthew Gold rolled a large metal wheel around the stage: slowly deliberately and for aural effect.         When I heard the Iceland Symphony Orchestra give  this workåÛåªs premiere  in a much larger hall in Reykjavik last April its gestures sounded distant and detached. MilleråÛåªs relative intimacy and dry acoustics provided the uncanny sensation of being enveloped in the musicåÛåªs minute doings and jostled by its outbursts.         Two pieces demonstrated Ms. ThorvaldsdottiråÛåªs fluid approach to the piano. In åÛåÏ[one]åÛå Richard Carrick played resonant notes on the keyboard but as often busied himself with the pianoåÛåªs subtly amplified innards. The percussionist David Shively with his back to the audience leaned into the instrument throughout eliciting eerie moans sighs and rumbles.         The piano also served percussive ends in åÛåÏRo/SerenityåÛå with a string quartet bass flute and bass clarinet fusing into a gaseous body. Melodic flickers and packets of simple harmony escaped the ensembleåÛåªs gravitational pull repeatedly only to be sucked back in.         After a brief onstage interview with Ms. Thorvaldsdottir conducted by Mr. Carrick åÛåÏTactilityåÛå for harp and percussion gave further evidence of a seemingly boundless textural imagination. Amplification made tiny patters wisps and thumps sing out while also facilitating further sounds unattainable from purely acoustic implements.         As Mr. Shively and the ingenious harpist Zeena Parkins worked at the back of the darkened platform their sounds emanated with vivid presence from loudspeakers on either side of the stage. It may have made sense for logistical reasons but had an effect of unintended distance with the players turned specters in a shadow puppet ritual.         åÛåÏHrimåÛå which ended the program has become Ms. ThorvaldsdottiråÛåªs signature piece with three prior performances in the United States (including  one in New York ). Understandably so: In just eight minutes this chamber orchestra work perfectly encapsulates her uncanny knack for conjuring the natural world åÛåÓ not through quaint picturesque mimicry but with potent evocations of elemental power flux and potential.

Every day The Federal Register the daily journal of the United States government publishes on  its website  and in a thick booklet around 100 executive orders proclamations proposed rule changes and other government notices that federal agencies are mandated to submit for public inspection.         So far so good.         It turns out however that the Federal Register employees who take in the information for publication from across the government still receive some of it on the 3.5-inch plastic storage squares that have become all but obsolete in the United States.         Now government infrastructure experts are hoping that public embarrassments like the HealthCare.gov debacle will prompt a closer look at the governmentåÛåªs technological prowess especially if it might mean getting rid of floppy disks.         åÛåÏYouåÛåªve got this antiquated system that still works but is not nearly as efficient as it could beåÛå said Stan Soloway chief executive of the Professional Services Council which represents more than 370 government contractors. åÛåÏCompanies that work with the government whether longstanding or newcomers are all hamstrung by the same limitations.åÛå         The use of floppy disks peaked in American homes and offices in the mid-1990s and modern computers do not even accommodate them anymore. But The Federal Register continues to accept them in part because legal and security requirements have yet to be updated but mostly because the wheels of government grind ever slowly.         Davita Vance-Cooks the head of the Government Printing Office which prints The Federal Register and publishes it online spoke at a congressional hearing on Wednesday about her departmentåÛåªs attempts to make its work remain relevant in a post-print world. Despite creating mobile apps The Federal Register still requires agencies to submit information on paper with original signatures though they can create a digital signature via a secured email system.         Agencies are also permitted to submit the documents on CD-ROMs and floppy disks but not on flash drives or SD cards. åÛåÏThe Federal Register Act says that an agency has to submit the original and two duplicate originals or two certified copiesåÛå said Amy P. Bunk The Federal RegisteråÛåªs director of legal affairs and policy. As long as an agency does that through one of the approved methods of transmission she said åÛåÏtheyåÛåªve met the statutory requirement.åÛå         But the secure email system åÛåÓ which uses software called Public Key Infrastructure technology åÛåÓ is expensive and some government agencies have not yet upgraded to it. As a result some agencies still scan documents on to a computer and save them on floppy disks. The disks are then sent by courier to the register.         Ms. Bunk said that although many agencies did use the secure email system The Federal Register could not require it until Congress made it compulsory by law.         åÛåÏThere are limits as to how far we can make the agencies do everything in lock stepåÛå said Jim Bradley the assistant public printer for the Government Printing Office. Federal budget cuts he said had helped slow down any modernization.         åÛåÏWeåÛåªve got to accommodate the funding and everything elseåÛå Mr. Bradley said. åÛåÏSome agencies move forward with technology and thatåÛåªs great. Other agencies arenåÛåªt ready to go this year maybe not next year.åÛå         A spokesman for The Federal Register would not say which agencies still used floppy disks. But at The RegisteråÛåªs office a modest space on North Capitol Street in sight of the Capitol dome couriers were recently seen coming in and out as an employee pulled a floppy disk from one package and at least two CD-ROMs from others.         Meanwhile experts say that an administration that prided itself on its technological savvy has a long way to go in updating the computer technology of the federal government. HealthCare.gov and the floppy disks of The Federal Register they say are but two recent examples of a government years behind the private sector in digital innovation.         Mr. Soloway of the Professional Services Council said that the governmentåÛåªs technology was also causing it to fall behind in cooperation with the private sector. åÛåÏItåÛåªs undoubtedly inhibiting the expansionåÛå of what corporations are willing to do with the government Mr. Soloway said. åÛåÏAnd it remains an inhibitor for the next generation of companies.åÛå

And then there is åÛåÏCity on FireåÛå the 900-page debut novel that took the publishing industry by storm last week.         It was even more evidence that the long novel is experiencing a resurgence as a dozen publishers competed for the rights to release the book set in New York City in the 1970s. åÛåÏCity on FireåÛå was written by Garth Risk Hallberg a 34-year-old who has contributed to The New York Times Book Review and The Millions. Publishers who had a copy of the manuscript åÛåÓ and said they could concentrate on little else until they had finished reading it åÛåÓ rapturously compared it to work by Michael Chabon and Thomas Pynchon.         The book drew an advance that is highly unusual for a debut novel. In a two-day bidding war 10 publishers bid more than $1 million. Knopf emerged the victor paying close to $2 million said two people familiar with the negotiations.         Before the acquisition Diana Miller an editor at Knopf wrote Chris Parris-Lamb Mr. HallbergåÛåªs agent an email praising the book saying it was åÛåÏoff the charts in its ambition its powers of observation its ability to be at once intellectual and emotionally generous.åÛå         Sonny Mehta the chairman and editor in chief of Knopf said on Sunday åÛåÏItåÛåªs a large spacious and extremely ambitious novel. It has a richness to it and that was really what I responded to almost immediately.åÛå         No publication date has been set.         Mr. Parris-Lamb first read the book a year ago and said that Mr. Hallberg who took six years to write it was initially concerned about the length. Mr. Hallberg declined to be interviewed.         åÛåÏThere are a lot of very long novels with not a lot of structure to themåÛå Mr. Parris-Lamb said. åÛåÏThe intentionality and purposefulness with which the novel reached these lengths is really remarkable.åÛå         The events of the book Mr. Parris-Lamb wrote in a letter to publishers åÛåÏrevolve around a central mystery: what exactly is going on behind the locked steel doors of a derelict townhouse in the East Village and what might it have to do with the shooting in Central Park in the novelåÛåªs opening act?åÛå         Mr. Hallberg has written an illustrated novella åÛåÏA Field Guide to the North American FamilyåÛå published in 2007.         Scott Rudin the producer bought the film rights to the new book last month before the auction for the publishing rights.         åÛåÏThe scale of it the vision of it the big political ideas how tightly knitted all the stories are to each other and how densely and pleasurably plotted it is made me feel like for the purposes of a movie he had done the lionåÛåªs share of the work that anyone would have to doåÛå Mr. Rudin said. åÛåÏIt doesnåÛåªt need to be massively reinvented to be a movie.åÛå

Kennedy students learn about today is not their grandparentsåÛåª J.F.K.         In a high school textbook edited by John M. Blum in 1968 Kennedy was a tragic hero cut down too soon in a transformative presidency who in his mere 1000 days in office åÛåÏrevived the idea of America as a young questing progressive land facing the future with confidence and hope.åÛå         By the mid-'80s that heady excitement was a distant memory and Kennedy a diminished one. A textbook written in 1987 by James A. Henretta and several colleagues complained of gauzy åÛåÏmythologizingåÛå about his tenure and said the high hopes he generated produced only åÛåÏrather meager legislative accomplishments.åÛå         The first åÛåÓ and for many the last åÛåÓ in-depth lesson that American students learn about the 35th president comes from high school textbooks. And on the eve of the anniversary of his assassination 50 years ago a review of more than two dozen written since then shows that the portrayal of him has fallen sharply over the years.         In general the picture has evolved from a charismatic young president who inspired youths around the world to a deeply flawed one whose oratory outstripped his accomplishments. Averting war in the Cuban missile crisis got less attention and respect. Legislative setbacks and a deepening commitment in Vietnam got more. The Kennedy-era glamour seemed more image than reality.         For example a 1975 high school text by Clarence Ver Steeg and Richard Hofstadter said that in his handling of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis åÛåÏKennedyåÛåªs true nature as a statesman became fully apparent.åÛå In åÛåÏA People and a NationåÛå they said his 1963 limited nuclear test ban treaty åÛåÏwas the greatest single step toward peace since the beginning of the Cold War.åÛå         On civil rights they said his administration åÛåÏdid not receive congressional cooperation.åÛå Even so they wrote inaccurately åÛåÏbuses hotels motels and restaurants were largely desegregatedåÛå in his presidency. Most of those changes came when the Civil Rights Act was signed by his successor Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.         Using the same title in 1982 Mary Beth Norton and several others took a very different approach in a college textbook widely used today in Advanced Placement courses.         They said he åÛåÏpursued civil rights with a notable lack of vigor.åÛå They blamed him for the missile crisis saying Cuban-Soviet fears of invasion were stoked by the 1961 Bay of Pigs landing and other United States moves against Cuba. They said KennedyåÛåªs real legacy was åÛåÏa huge military expansion that helped goad the Russians into an accelerated arms race.åÛå         In 2009 Joyce ApplebyåÛåªs åÛåÏAmerican JourneyåÛå said of the missile crisis: åÛåÏWhile it seemed like a victory at the time it left a Communist government intact just miles from the U.S. coastline. The humiliation of giving in also prompted the Soviets to begin the largest peacetime military buildup in history.åÛå         There are a variety of reasons for the shift. First of all the dazzle of the handsome young president and the assassination in Dallas elevated Kennedy to a heroic level impossible to maintain.         Another is that new writers and editors added different perspectives. In particular the Vietnam generation began writing and editing and KennedyåÛåªs role in the war began to matter more. Also his extramarital affairs became known providing fodder for criticism. And the release of White House tapes beginning in 1984 showed a coldly pragmatic politician not the idealist on issues like civil rights whom people had heard about or imagined.         Finally the åÛå÷80s saw a shift in textbook historiography. Gilbert Sewall the director of the  American Textbook Council  a nonprofit organization that reviews educational materials said the older approach concentrated on successes in American history. In the åÛå÷80s he said that was replaced by a åÛåÏrevisioniståÛå approach that not only focused on injustices like the mistreatment of Indians but also highlighted flaws of those previously treated as heroic like slaveholding among the founding fathers. åÛåÏThe Norton book brought this revisionism into a bright lightåÛå he said.

The person behind the recent scheme a trader known on Twitter as Fontas said in a secure Internet chat that he operated with little fear of a crackdown. ‰ÛÏFor now the lack of regulations allows everything to happen‰Û Fontas said in the chat where he verified his control of the Twitter account which has thousands of followers but did not give his identity. He added that Bitcoin and its users would benefit when someone steps in to police this financial wild west and would stop his schemes when they do. Chinese authorities drew attention to the issue on Thursday when they announced that they were barring Chinese banks from making Bitcoin transactions. The same day the Bank of France issued its own warning about the potential risks. The news sent the price of Bitcoin tumbling but it quickly bounced back to near its all-time high of around $1200. Bitcoins are little more than computer code ‰ÛÓ created according to a set algorithm and traded between online wallets using virtual keys. Some people insist that virtual currencies could become a revolutionary new form of payment in the real world.  Bank of America  became the first major Wall Street bank to release research about Bitcoin on Thursday noting that it could become ‰ÛÏa major player in both e-commerce and money transfer.‰Û So far though Bitcoin has been driven up primarily by people who are betting it will rise and rise because there is a finite supply. The initial computer program established that only 21 million Bitcoins would ever be created. Because there are no limits on who can buy Bitcoins they have attracted investors of all stripes. The value of all the Bitcoins in existence is now more than $12 billion after a volatile surge increased the value by more than 1000 percent over the last month. But the excitement over this rapid ascent has obscured the fraud hacking and outright theft that have become an increasingly regular part of the virtual currency world ‰ÛÓ even for the most sophisticated legitimate players ‰ÛÓ and the lack of any visible response from law enforcement agencies. This has allowed more than 30 episodes in which at least 1000 Bitcoins ‰ÛÓ or $1 million at the current rate of exchange ‰ÛÓ were stolen or transferred illegally according to a frequently updated list on the most popular online forum for Bitcoin. Of those cases 10 involved losses of more than 10000 Bitcoins or $10 million at the current value. The authorities have only been publicly involved in one of these cases. This week the virtual currency world has been abuzz over a heist in which 96000 Bitcoins ‰ÛÓ currently worth about $100 million ‰ÛÓ were said to be taken from an online marketplace known for selling illegal drugs. Because of the murky nature of the virtual currency thefts can be hard to verify. But the increasing stream of episodes underscores how quickly con artists can take advantage of new forms of investing and how slow the authorities can be in responding to emerging financial risks. The association of state securities regulators put digital money on its list of the top 10 threats to investors for the first time this year. At a hearing last month three federal agencies said they were carefully tracking virtual currencies for illicit activity. But Judith M. Shaw the top securities regulator in Maine said that it was often hard to determine which authority should be cracking down on virtual currency fraud or even what constitutes fraud in a market that some view as a giant bubble and others as the future of money. ‰ÛÏThe jurisdiction has not been clearly established because it‰Ûªs new uncharted territory‰Û Ms. Shaw said. ‰ÛÏEveryone is just trying to figure out how this is all going to play out.‰Û

The prosecutor rejected the manåÛåªs assertion that he had been acting in self-defense when he opened his front door and fired a shotgun at the woman through a locked screen door striking her in the face.         The man Theodore Paul Wafer who is white and an employee at the Wayne County Airport Authority entered a not-guilty plea during an arraignment on Friday. Mr. Wafer had told the police that he believed the woman was breaking into his home. The prosecutor Kym Worthy said that she found no evidence of an attempted break-in and that the woman Renisha Marie McBride 19 had been knocking on the door.         The shooting has ignited an anguished conversation in this largely black city and beyond about why another unarmed black person has been killed and whether the legal system would call anyone to account. It was the third high-profile racially charged case this year following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida and the recent police shooting of Jonathan Ferrell in North Carolina after he sought help following a car accident.         Ms. Worthy who is the Wayne County prosecutor and who herself is black said åÛåÏRace is not relevant.åÛå She based her decision åÛåÏon the facts and the evidenceåÛå and not on public opinion or mounting comparisons to other cases she said.         Emphasizing that the shooting had not met the provisions of MichiganåÛåªs self-defense law Ms. Worthy said åÛåÏThere is no duty to retreat in your own home.åÛå But reading from the state code she said that a person may use deadly force only if åÛåÏthe individual honestly and reasonably believes that the use of deadly force is necessary to prevent the imminent death of or imminent great bodily harm to himself or herself or to another individual.åÛå         Some however said that charges were only a start.         åÛåÏI think people donåÛåªt understand that this stuff is happening all the timeåÛå said the Rev. Charles Williams II the Detroit leader of the National Action Network. åÛåÏWeåÛåªre happy we got a charge in this case åÛåÓ thatåÛåªs progress åÛåÓ but this whole situation tells us that there is still work to do when it comes to race in America.åÛå         In a courtroom in Dearborn Heights here on Friday afternoon Mr. Wafer 54 stood largely silent. Seeking a bond lower than the $250000 that was ultimately set his lawyer Mack Carpenter told a judge that Mr. Wafer was a longtime Michigan resident who took care of his 81-year-old mother. Mr. Carpenter said Mr. Wafer had the highest possible security clearance at the airport authority where he works. Michigan State Police records show Mr. Wafer has had two driving offenses decades old.         By the end of the day Mr. Wafer had posted bond and was to be released the authorities said. He was placed on administrative leave from his job an official from the airport authority said.         In addition to murder in the second degree Mr. Wafer was charged with manslaughter and a weapons violation connected to using his Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun. The weapon Ms. Worthy said appeared to be legally owned by Mr. Wafer. The charges could carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. His lawyer Mr. Carpenter said he would offer a strong defense.         Members of Ms. McBrideåÛåªs family who say they feel certain race played a role in her death are hopeful about the prosecutoråÛåªs decision to bring charges.         åÛåÏRenisha can rest nowåÛå said Bernita Spinks Ms. McBrideåÛåªs aunt. åÛåÏIt shows that nobody can get away with what heåÛåªs done.åÛå         Civil rights leaders here who had questioned why Mr. Wafer was not arrested immediately after the shooting said that the charges were as serious as they could have anticipated and had come with relative speed.

A lawyer turned professional matchmaker she was prospecting at a charity bachelor auction in 2009 when she spotted Joshua Kagan and introduced herself thinking this charming good-looking man might become a customer or perhaps turn out to be just the man for one of her other clients.         Mr. Kagan newly separated from his first wife was flattered and thought that Ms. Galison who had short hair was beautiful. But his heart sank when she explained that she was interested in him åÛåÓ for someone else. åÛåÏI donåÛåªt want to meet any clientsåÛå Mr. Kagan told her. åÛåÏI only want to date the matchmaker.åÛå         But the matchmaker had no interest in dating or time for it. Her focus was on keeping her service Sunday at Noon afloat in a recession. She handed him her business card but he never called. By the fall of 2010 Sunday at Noon had stabilized. Ms. Galison now 40 recalled how she became concerned that she hadnåÛåªt found a partner. åÛåÏEvery moment I was awake I was workingåÛå she said. åÛåÏI slowly wrestled my life back.åÛå         While Ms. GalisonåÛåªs struggles were ending Mr. KaganåÛåªs were building. His mother had Stage 4 lung cancer (despite not being a smoker) he had not made peace with the separation from his wife and his dating life was not proving fruitful. Then while on Facebook browsing through a list of people who were to attend an arts event a photo of a longhaired woman åÛåÏjumped right out at meåÛå he said. It was of Ms. Galison but because of her new hairstyle he failed to recognize her.         åÛåÏAt the risk of sounding like a Nicholas Sparks novel I fell in love with her through her picturesåÛå said Mr. Kagan now 48 who owns an executive search firm for lawyers in New York. He was determined to meet her.         Yet even as he clicked through to Ms. GalisonåÛåªs Facebook profile in which her business was cited it still did not dawn on him that this was the matchmaker who had approached him. He did however strategize a way to connect with this seeming stranger. He reasoned: åÛåÏShe matches people with people. I match people with jobs.åÛå He then sent her a message that they should meet at the party.         Ms. Galison had not recognized Mr. Kagan either and was weary of getting requests to åÛåÏnetworkåÛå so she sent a short-though-polite message saying that she hoped to see him there. But they failed to find each other at the crowded event so Mr. Kagan sent another message inviting her to lunch. Ms. Galison wrote back asking what his intentions were and Mr. Kagan replied that in addition to networking he was wondering if a åÛåÏstrikingly beautifulåÛå matchmaker was single.         She was taken by his confidence. Then she began looking through the rest of his pictures. åÛåÏOh heåÛåªs adorableåÛå she recalled thinking. åÛåÏBut then I saw he had three boys and that he was a little more OrthodoxåÛå (his sons wore skullcaps). åÛåÏIt went from åÛå÷Oh maybeåÛåª to åÛå÷No way.åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå         Still Ms. Galison whose Jewish upbringing was more cultural than religious figured he would make a good business contact so she agreed to get together with him. And when they did meet the following Wednesday they quickly uncovered their earlier connection.         Ms. Galison normally advises her clients to åÛåÏstay away from sad topicsåÛå on first dates but over the next four hours they found themselves discussing his motheråÛåªs cancer and the death of one of his brothers from a brain aneurysm. Mr. Kagan found Ms. GalisonåÛåªs empathy disarming. åÛåÏIn a nice nonflirtatious way she touched my handåÛå Mr. Kagan said. åÛåÏShe just made it spark right up through my body. I was hooked!åÛå         Yes she was single Ms. Galison told him but she did not hesitate to enumerate her concerns about dating a religious man with children. Mr. Kagan was undeterred. åÛåÏI said åÛå÷I know IåÛåªm not the poster child for what youåÛåªre looking for but letåÛåªs not let this date endåÛåªÌâåÊåÛå Mr. Kagan said.

British researchers followed a group of 1140 infants from birth to 2 years while their mothers completed diaries detailing the babies‰Ûª diets and noting suspected  allergic reactions  to food which researchers later confirmed by testing. They found 41 babies with confirmed food allergies and compared them with 82 age-matched healthy controls. All were born between January 2006 and October 2007. After controlling for birth weight the duration of  pregnancy  maternal allergies and many other factors they found that 17 weeks was the crucial age: babies who were introduced to solids before this age were significantly more likely to develop food allergies.  The study  published online in Pediatrics  found that continuing to breast-feed while introducing cow‰Ûªs milk also had a protective effect against allergies. The authors suggest that the immunologic factors in  breast milk  are what provide the advantage.  ‰ÛÏDon‰Ûªt introduce solids until 17 weeks‰Û said the lead author Kate E. C. Grimshaw a nutritionist at the University of Southampton ‰ÛÏand if you can wait longer that‰Ûªs fine too. At whatever age you begin solid foods you should continue breast-feeding as well. And for those who cannot breast-feed the advice not to introduce solid foods until 17 weeks is still applicable.‰Û Parenting All open questions åÈ Marathon half-marathon 10k and 5K training plans to get you race ready.

At one point he held aloft a copy of New York CityåÛåªs Civil Service newspaper The Chief.         åÛåÏYou are here to make money in this country and to get a better lifeåÛå Mr. Khan said.         There was more than one way toward that American dream he acknowledged outlining a few options. But one path seemed to stand above the others if only because Mr. Khan had already paved the way: He is a traffic enforcement agent.         Mr. Khan is part of an influx of Bangladeshi immigrants who earn a living by writing parking summonses for the city a curious and growing presence navigating the choking traffic and bumper-to-bumper sea of parked cars.         Bangladeshi immigrants who represent less than 1 percent of the cityåÛåªs population now make up between 10 percent and 15 percent of the 3000 traffic agents Robert Cassar the president of the union representing the agents said.         The Friday after Thanksgiving which many New Yorkers mistakenly believe offers a holiday reprieve from usual parking restrictions is in fact one of the busiest days of the year for traffic agents. Mohammed Chowdhury who is from Bangladesh and supervises traffic operations for much of Queens said his officers might write three times as many tickets on that day.         åÛåÏThe next morning everyone is feeling lazy; and who is going to get up and move the car?åÛå he said. åÛåÏIf there is street cleaning on Friday where you live almost 80 percent of the cars wonåÛåªt be moved. TheyåÛåªll all get ticketed.åÛå         In the last decade union officials said at least 400 Bangladeshi immigrants have become traffic agents in New York opening a new career path to those who traditionally find their way in this country from behind the wheel of a taxicab. City records put the number at slightly less than 200 but Police Department officials said they suspected the number to be higher because many employees do not list their birthplace.         Salaries start at $29000 a year but the insurance benefits and pension are generous. A college education and citizenship are not needed; one must be legally eligible to work in the United States and possess a high school diploma. Residency requirements are also slight.         Before becoming an agent Sheikh Zaman was an airport security guard in New York a job that did not have the stature of his occupation back home in Bangladesh where he oversaw murder rape and robbery investigations for the national police force. He assumed that his chances of securing a job with the New York Police Department were next to nil but he could not help wondering why he saw so many of his countrymen wearing police uniforms writing summonses.         åÛåÏI saw a lot of Bengali people walking around the city writing ticketsåÛå he recalled recently. He asked how they got hired. åÛåÏI was surprisedåÛå he said. åÛåÏThey told me this was a very easy job to get.åÛå         Mr. Zaman took a Civil Service test in 2008 and began his new career the next year.         åÛåÏI love my job I respect the jobåÛå Mr. Zaman 40 said. åÛåÏNobody likes getting tickets but I enjoy the job. It gives me security. IåÛåªm happy.åÛå         The proliferation of Bangladeshi traffic agents has a lot to do with word of mouth much of it from Mr. Khan a 53-year-old traffic agent and union official whose informal advice and encouragement to Bangladeshi immigrants turned into sit-down seminars in which he helps applicants prepare for the Civil Service exam.         åÛåÏI had thought having a uniform meant you were born in America; that was a misunderstandingåÛå recalled Mr. Khan an energetic man who made a living as an itinerant magician in his native Bangladesh. åÛåÏWhen I joined I opened the door.åÛå

Now after a long dry spell Broadway has a deadly sociopath to call its own. Please give a hearty welcome to Monty Navarro the conniving killer who helps turn murder most foul into entertainment most merry in the new musical  åÛåÏA GentlemanåÛåªs Guide to Love and Murder.åÛå                               Despite the high body count this delightful show will lift the hearts of all those whoåÛåªve been pining for what sometimes seems a lost art form: musicals that match streams of memorable melody with fizzily witty turns of phrase. Bloodlust hasnåÛåªt sung so sweetly or provided so much theatrical fun since  Sweeney Todd  first wielded his razor with gusto many a long year ago.                                     The seriously squeamish neednåÛåªt fear entering the Walter Kerr Theater where this frolicsome operetta opened on Sunday night. Although our antihero played with brash innocence lightly sprinkled with arsenic by Bryce Pinkham eventually piles up a stack of corpses to rival that of dear old Mr. Todd heåÛåªs a much cuddlier fellow. A gentleman indeed whose only wish is to secure his fortune by bumping off a few inconvenient relatives in Edwardian England.                                     Since these spoiled sprigs on the family tree are mostly stuffed shirts or stuffed skirts åÛåÓ and are all played by the dazzling Jefferson Mays åÛåÓ youåÛåªll be laughing too hard to shed a tear for any of them. (Those looking for fresh holiday entertainment for the family should know thereåÛåªs nothing here to frighten children.)                                     Mr. Mays won a Tony Award for playing multiple roles in the Pulitzer Prize-winning solo show  åÛåÏI Am My Own WifeåÛå  but the  chameleonic performance  he gives here makes even that feat seem simple åÛåÓ a matter of filing your nails while whistling åÛåÏEdelweissåÛå say. In a true tour de force that is hardly likely to be bettered on Broadway this season (apologies to the magnificent  Mark Rylance  and those two knights Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart performing Beckett and Pinter in repertory) Mr. Mays sings dances ice-skates bicycles and generally romps through some eight roles åÛåÓ flipping among personas male female and somewhere in between åÛåÓ at a pace that sets your head spinning. (ItåÛåªs almost an in-joke when one of his doomed characters meets his end through decapitation.)                                     Written by Robert L. Freedman (book and lyrics) and Steven Lutvak (music and lyrics) both welcome newcomers to Broadway åÛåÏGentlemanåÛåªs GuideåÛå is based on a 1907 novel by Roy Horniman. Fans of British film will recognize the plot from the classic British comedy  åÛåÏKind Hearts and CoronetsåÛå  which gave Alec Guinness a chance to display his own virtuosity as a raft of British gentlefolk falling prey to an ambitious relative. Here the mood is more farcical the score a skillful homage to Gilbert and Sullivan and the well-heeled family is called the DåÛåªYsquiths. (ThatåÛåªs DIE-squith wouldnåÛåªt you know.)                                     The penniless Monty little knows of his relationship to the clan when we find him in the opening scene mourning his newly deceased mother. A visit from an old friend of hers the nosy Miss Shingle (the excellent Jane Carr) brings startling news: The mother he knew only as a Dickensian sufferer åÛåÓ scrubbing floors to feed her beloved only son åÛåÓ was in fact a highborn DåÛåªYsquith banished forever when she ran off with a Castilian defying her familyåÛåªs wishes.                                     åÛåÏAnd by my estimationåÛå Miss Shingle casually adds åÛåÏonly eight other relations stand between you and the current Earl of Highhurst Lord Adalbert DåÛåªYsquith himself.åÛå                                     This tempting tidbit lodges in MontyåÛåªs fertile mind and begins forthwith to sow dark intentions. Monty is on the verge of losing his love the socially ambitious Sibella Hallward (Lisa OåÛåªHare) to a more well-heeled man. Might she not reconsider if Monty were to establish himself as a bona fide DåÛåªYsquith or better yet to hack his way through all that underbrush on the family tree and arrive at the tippy top becoming the ninth earl of Highhurst?

A young woman new to New York found herself pushed beyond what she could bear forced to work by a big bad corporation for a compensation of exactly zero.         åÛåÏI cried myself to sleep at least three nights a weekåÛå Lisa Denmark told The Post.         And where the reader might ask is this gulag of horrors? That would be Vogue magazine at 4 Times Square headquarters of  CondÌÄå© Nast  Publications. Ms. Denmark was terrorized for åÛåÏnot putting the tape on the mood boards correctlyåÛå (donåÛåªt ask because I donåÛåªt know and donåÛåªt want to know) and was forced to load an editoråÛåªs books into a car and take them to the bookstore for resale pick up dry cleaning and fetch juice.         Pity the poor interns or tell them to get over themselves but while you are at it save one or two tears for the six million young people between the ages of 18 and 24 who are  neither in school nor employed . In a country full of young people who have been burdened with enormous  student loans  and uncertain prospects internships in Manhattan are very tiny in the scheme of things but telling in terms of the business itself.         Unpaid internships which are to the publishing business what the mailroom was to Hollywood studios are under broad attack. Both  Hearst Magazines  and CondÌÄå© Nast have been sued by former interns who assert that they performed a great deal of work for little or no money. Hearst which has vigorously defended itself in court is contemplating dumping internships and WomenåÛåªs Wear Daily  revealed last month  that CondÌÄå© Nast would  no longer provide internships .         These internships are by their very nature discriminatory. Only a certain kind of young person can afford to spend a summer working for no pay. According to sources at the major publishers more than one in five of these plum spots typically go to people who are connected one way or another.         Unpaid internships typically provide people who already have a leg up a way to get the other leg up. (This might be the spot to mention that for three days during Fashion Week my 17-year-old daughter did an unofficial unpaid stint at Cosmopolitan.)         But the cure åÛåÓ doing away with internships åÛåÓ doesnåÛåªt solve the problem for either the interns or the publishers. The people who know someone who know someone will probably still get a low-paying gig. The people working with only their bootstraps will be out of luck.         By suing the interns have won the battle but seem to have lost the war. (The New York Times by the way pays its interns but the slots are limited and the competition is steep.)         This would seem to be a good time to rethink the entire issue. As currently configured publishing internships do very little for the organizations that host them and merely burnish the rÌÄå©sumÌÄå©s of a lucky few. Publishers are keenly concerned that their Starbucks orders are delivered just so but less interested in what interns themselves might have to contribute.         To read most of the big magazines on the newsstand right now is to get a look into the soul of Manhattan such as that is but little insight into the rest of the country or world. Magazines desperate to connect with young readers and advertisers are more than ever a collection of bulletins from a rarefied hothouse.         Paid internships properly conceived and administered could bring a diversity of region class and race to an industry where the elevators are full of people who look alike talk alike and think alike. Pie in the sky? Not at  Atlantic Media . Three years ago the company made the decision to end unpaid internships and go to yearlong fellowships that had meaningful tasks an educational component a living wage attached and get this health insurance.         There are now 45 fellows working across its publications and several have graduated to significant permanent roles at the company.         åÛåÏWe were looking for ambitious creative original journalists and we did not want income to be a barrieråÛå said James Bennet editor in chief of The Atlantic. åÛåÏPublishing that includes the web means we need to reach a national audience and that requires a diverse mix of class region race and yes generations to do our job.åÛå         The odd thing about those good intentions and enlightened talk? ItåÛåªs been good for business. The Atlantic is expanding its audience through the magazine and its website along with  The Wire  its high-tempo news site; and  Atlantic Cities  a site that covers urban issues. The audience seems to be noticing. According to GfK MRIåÛåªs annual survey tracking print and digital readership The Atlantic has  grown 34 percent  in the first half of this year.         The Atlantic experiment conforms to my own experience. In the 1990s I ran  The Washington City Paper  a newspaper mostly staffed by white people in a majority-black city. By funding fellowships and entry-level positions we were able to bring new perspectives aboard by publishing work from  Ta-Nehisi Coates  now a senior editor and National Magazine Award winner for The Atlantic (who also contributes to The Times);  Holly Bass  a Washington-based performance artist and writer;  William Jelani Cobb  a University of Connecticut associate professor author and essayist who went on to publish in The New Yorker The Washington Post and  TheRoot.com ; and  Neil Drumming  an alumnus of Entertainment Weekly who is now a critic at Salon and directed and wrote åÛåÏ Big Words åÛå a feature film that came out this year to great reviews.         Despite the industry canard about a lack of qualified minority candidates finding these writers all of whom are black wasnåÛåªt hard at all. It was easy.         Unfortunately creating meaningful internships and funding them seems like a low priority for an industry that is in a knife fight to survive. But if magazines are going to be anything other than gossamer artifacts of declining interest the people who run them might want to rethink how they employ their interns. Bringing on young people from all kinds of backgrounds is less a moral nicety than a business imperative.         Yes itåÛåªs swell to have someone to pick up your dry cleaning but itåÛåªs a lot more important to come up with a product that other people will pick up.

It could prove devilishly difficult for Mr. de Blasio åÛåÓ long a favorite of the cityåÛåªs unions åÛåÓ to deliver even a small part of what labor leaders are demanding because the city faces an anticipated $2 billion deficit next year. This poses a quandary for Mr. de Blasio fiscal experts say åÛåÓ if he gives billions in retroactive pay to the unions that means he might have to cut spending on schools the police or parks or face a harder time financing his cherished plans for universal prekindergarten.         When Mr. Bloomberg was pushing for low åÛåÓ or no åÛåÓ wage increases in union negotiations several years ago labor leaders walked away from the bargaining convinced that they would get a better deal from whoever was elected the next mayor. But now it appears that the union chiefs may have miscalculated because after years without a contract they are asking Mr. de Blasio for a large amount of retroactive wage increases that he simply may not be able to pay.         åÛåÏThe municipal unions made a decision that they would rather wait for the next mayor than try to resolve their contracts with Mayor BloombergåÛå said Carol Kellermann president of the  Citizens Budget Commission  a business-backed fiscal watchdog. åÛåÏO.K. now they have their new mayor. TheyåÛåªre asking him for a lot of money no matter how you slice it but nobody thinks that amount of money is available.åÛå         Mr. de Blasio faces a huge challenge she said because of the workersåÛåª pent-up frustrations as well as the logistical ordeal of negotiating agreements with the cityåÛåªs 152 bargaining units all of them with expired contracts.         The  United Federation of Teachers which  has been without a contract since 2009 asserts its members are owed the same 4 percent raises that other municipal unions received back in 2008. That would translate into more than $3 billion in retroactive pay while the  PatrolmenåÛåªs Benevolent Association  which represents 23000 police officers is seeking $500 million in back pay.         åÛåÏThere has to be retroactive payåÛå said Harry Nespoli the president of the Uniformed SanitationmenåÛåªs Association and chairman of the Municipal Labor Committee the umbrella group for municipal unions. åÛåÏWeåÛåªve been working too long without a contract. Our members have had to use credit cards to pay their bills.åÛå         A top de Blasio aide declined to comment saying the mayor-elect would not negotiate in the news media. During his campaign Mr. de Blasio expressed an openness to some degree of back pay for workers but said full retroactive raises would not be possible.         åÛåÏThereåÛåªs no way in the world to pay out the full amount åÛåÓ thatåÛåªs estimated as much as $7 to $8 billion and thatåÛåªs impossible to findåÛå Mr. de Blasio said in the campaignåÛåªs final debate on Oct. 30. He added åÛåÏIf they want to talk about retroactive pay thatåÛåªs their right but they have to show us the cost savings to go with it.åÛå         Mr. Bloomberg the Citizens Budget Commission and others see retroactive pay as a luxury an unnecessary bonus the city can ill afford. They maintain that the cityåÛåªs workers already make a good living even without raises in recent years. And they point out that some city workers most notably teachers have continued to get annual step raises to recognize their increased seniority so their actual take-home pay has increased. A deputy mayor Caswell F. Holloway IV also argued that municipal workers should be grateful that Mr. Bloomberg unlike many other mayors avoided sizable layoffs even during the worst recession since the Great Depression.         But municipal workers complain that they have gone two three four years without raises causing their salaries to fall behind inflation and they argue that the city has a moral obligation to compensate them for the years without a raise.         It is no secret that the unions look forward to dealing with Mr. de Blasio instead of Mr. Bloomberg. åÛåÏThe city just finished another banner year with a major surplus and when it comes to what the mayor says about the teachersåÛåª union and how he treats the workers of New York City I find him to be disgustingåÛå said  Michael Mulgrew  president of the teachersåÛåª union.         But  Joshua B. Freeman  a labor historian at City University of New York said Mr. de Blasio was less beholden to municipal unions than many might think. In the Democratic primary for mayor the only municipal union that endorsed him was the one representing City University professors. The largest municipal union District Council 37  endorsed the mayoral candidacy of the city comptroller John C. Liu  while  the teachers backed the candidacy of a former comptroller William C. Thompson Jr.  Mr. de Blasio had  the coveted endorsement of 1199/SEIU  the giant health care union but that union does not represent city workers.         åÛåÏOne thing the new mayor has going for him is almost no municipal unions back him until after the primaryåÛå Mr. Freeman said. åÛåÏThat might give him a little latitude.åÛå

They did a great Thanksgiving; crazy newspaper stories; relatives weåÛåªd known so long they felt like ours; little tables with antique linens and dishes of chocolates and nuts chocolates before you even started the meal.         åÛåÏHow could I enjoy anything with you here like this?åÛå Herb says.           Like this : Staples in my belly. A morphine drip. My surgeon from when I had breast cancer the easy cancer coming in to visit saying åÛåÏThey tell me it isnåÛåªt as dire as it looks.åÛå         Herb isnåÛåªt my husband. At the time this is happening he has been my best friend for 20 years a feature writer like me. The first night after surgery he sleeps in a chair next to my bed. He stays in the room when the nurses change the dressings. He sees the sanitary pads with the blood the kind you get when they take out your ovaries and your fallopian tubes but cannot remove the uterus because it is stuck to the colon with what the doctors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering euphemistically call åÛåÏdisease.åÛå         Love does not come as expected in a cancer hospital. I had seen this a few years earlier sharing a room with a woman who was dying. She looked like what I had once thought cancer looked like: emaciated skin and bones. Her husband was with her. In the middle of the night the woman moved her bowels. The sharp stink of it pervaded the room. Her husband stayed by her side and murmured comforting things and emptied the bedpan and I staying overnight for a minor procedure thought that this is what real love was and how different it is from what you think love is when you are 22 and what you see in the magazines: the romantic dates the sexy lingerie the beautiful young woman the rich handsome man helping her out of the expensive car. Love was emptying the bedpan. Love was sleeping in a chair.         Food does not interest me during the bad Thanksgiving which is good because I cannot eat. I suck on ice cubes and sometimes there is a broth and eventually I work up to Jello. Herb is indifferent to holidays though not to food but Thanksgiving that year does not interest him either. Thanksgiving evaporates. I seem to remember sending him to the cafeteria Thanksgiving Day and talking about a very bad hamburger but I am on morphine I am stoned so who knows. And when I am not stoned I think about death. It has a presence as strong as HerbåÛåªs itåÛåªs sitting in its own chair itåÛåªs talking to me.         åÛåÏ You dodged me once kiddo but IåÛåªm back. Refuse to think about me? Yeah right. HowåÛåªs that working out?åÛå   When I come home after Thanksgiving there is food. My friends Sybil and Martin send a cooked chicken and mashed potatoes from the Jefferson Market because they know I do not cook; my college roommate Christie sends a pound of chocolate with a note åÛåÏEat it allåÛå; my friend Carol drops off her spectacular meatloaf through a year of chemotherapy just leaving it at the door because she knows whatåÛåªs going on. When I have chemo every three weeks Herb comes to my house and sleeps on a blow-up bed and when he has to go out of town my friend Cheryl comes down to New York from Boston and fills in.         I try to avoid the stats but there comes a time I have to decide between protocols so I go to SybilåÛåªs to do research because her computer is faster. These are the early days of the web the mid-90s; research is harder. The survival rate we measure everything against is five years though sometimes the reports deal with two. The numbers are bad: 25 percent of patients lived two years on this trial; 20 percent lasted five years on that one.         åÛåÏSo you think you have time for a cup of coffee?åÛå Sybil asks finally. åÛåÏIf I make it instant?åÛå         I am laughing. I am doubled over laughing. Here is my big insight: You can have a Stage 3 cancer but when a friend cracks you up you are as alive as anyone else.         So here we are 18 years later. Not all of us. My friend Heidi Handman lost to cancer; my friend Vic Ziegel lost to cancer; my friend Jack Newfield lost to cancer; my Aunt Shirley Wadler lost to cancer. The older you get the more the losses.         On Thursday Herb and I will get on the train to my nieceåÛåªs and the family in New Jersey. I will carry two remote-control toy cars a jeep and a fire engine so my nephews can smash them into one another. Herb will carry two bottles of red wine. We will tell stories and crack one another up.         ItåÛåªs Thanksgiving. I am thankful.

McKenna in San Diego last year through the high-end matchmaker Kelleher International they were both professing interest in finding a marriage partner she recalls.         The relationship did not last long åÛåÓ but she did become pregnant. And now the skier 36 and Ms. McKenna 27 a former Marine and firefighter who is attending Columbia University with G.I. Bill support are locked in a cross-country custody fight that has become not only tabloid fodder but also a closely watched legal battle over the rights of pregnant women to travel and make life choices.         In December when she was seven months pregnant and already sparring with Mr. Miller about their future relations Ms. McKenna moved to New York to start school. Mr. Miller accused her of fleeing to find a sympathetic court and a New York judge agreed castigating Ms. McKenna for virtually absconding with her fetus. This allowed a California court to subsequently grant custody of the baby a boy to Mr. Miller and also set off alarm bells among advocates for womenåÛåªs rights.         But on Nov. 14 a five-judge appeals court in New York said Ms. McKennaåÛåªs basic rights had been violated adding åÛåÏPutative fathers have neither the right nor the ability to restrict a pregnant woman from her constitutionally protected liberty.åÛå         The appeals court also ruled that jurisdiction belonged in New York.         On Monday a New York City Family Court will start proceedings that could switch custody of the boy now nine months old back to Ms. McKenna.         But a tug of war between courts in two states remains possible because the San Diego judge has not yet ceded jurisdiction.         It is an unusual celebrity custody case not centered on extravagant financial demands or questions about paternity. Both sides say they hope for åÛåÏco-parentingåÛå but relations have been poisoned by what Ms. McKenna says is a steamroller campaign by Mr. Miller to push her to the margins and by what Mr. Miller calls the motheråÛåªs uncooperative behavior based on a quest for revenge.         They cannot even agree on what to call the boy. When he was born in New York on Feb. 23 Ms. McKenna pointedly gave the newborn Mr. MilleråÛåªs given names registering him as Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna. She calls him Sam. Mr. Miller won permission from the California court to add Nathaniel as a middle name in honor of his recently deceased brother and he calls the boy Nate.         WomenåÛåªs rights advocates called the early decisions questioning Ms. McKennaåÛåªs behavior a threat to the autonomy of pregnant women and applauded the appeals court reversal.         åÛåÏEspecially with current political pressures to recognize separate legal rights for fetuses there will be increasing calls on the courts to fault a pregnant woman for moving to restrain women from living their lives because theyåÛåªre pregnantåÛå said Sarah E. Burns the head of the Reproductive Justice Clinic at the New York University law school.         Ms. Burns was an author along with several womenåÛåªs rights groups of a  åÛåÏfriend of the courtåÛå brief  in Ms. McKennaåÛåªs successful New York appeal which was argued on a pro bono basis by the firm Amed Marzano & Sediva.         Mr. Miller is currently training for the Sochi Winter Olympics. In October 2012 he married Morgan Beck a beach volleyball star and model he started dating around the time Ms. McKenna became pregnant. They often travel together to tournaments and promotional events posting pictures of Nate on social media.         The marriage provided new grist for conflict. Ms. McKenna has accused Ms. Miller who announced that she had a miscarriage in January of seeking to replace her as a mother. Ms. Miller in a blog post on Nov. 16 that was soon taken down contrasted their åÛåÏloving and balanced familyåÛå with Ms. McKennaåÛåªs heavy reliance on child care.         Ms. McKenna joined the Marines at 17 and four years later became a firefighter at Camp Pendleton the Marine base near San Diego.

In a narrow vote of 342 to 326 with 19 abstentions lawmakers rejected a  proposal to phase out  deep-sea trawling in which heavy nets are dragged on the ocean floor at depths of more than 600 meters or about 2000 feet.         The Parliament which meets in Strasbourg in eastern France did vote to end trawling in areas with ecosystems most at risk like those rich in slow-growing corals and sponges.         And they inserted a requirement calling for a review of the equipment used in deep-sea fishing åÛåÓ including gill nets which are either anchored to the ocean bottom or allowed to drift in the current entrapping fish by their gills. In theory the review could lead to a ban on all deep-sea fishing with gear found to be especially destructive.         Little is known about life in the deep sea often defined as areas 200 meters or more below the surface as exploration is costly and difficult. But many of the species that dwell there grow slowly reaching reproductive maturity at relatively advanced ages. Some scientists say trawling may cause irreversible damage to fragile ecosystems in oceans already stressed by pollution global warming and  acidification .         Among the primary targets for deep-sea trawling are blue ling black scabbardfish and roundnose grenadier. But such fishing is indiscriminate vacuuming up numerous species that have no commercial value and are discarded overboard dead.         Fishermen have gone ever deeper in search of fish as species in shallower waters have become harder to find. Still deep-sea trawling yields only a fraction of the worldåÛåªs catch. The European Commission the European UnionåÛåªs executive arm estimated that only 1 percent of fish caught in the northeast Atlantic would be affected by a ban.         Environmental organizations reacted with dismay to the vote. A burst of last-minute maneuvering had made it appear on Monday that a ban might be approved despite the objections of ParliamentåÛåªs own fisheries committee but that panelåÛåªs proposal ultimately won the day.         Justine Maillot an adviser to Greenpeace said the vote showed that the Parliament was in the end åÛåÏat best halfhearted.åÛå She added åÛåÏIt failed to ban the devastating and indiscriminate practice of bottom trawling.åÛå         In  a Twitter message  Isabelle Thomas a French Socialist legislator from Brittany a base for much of EuropeåÛåªs deepwater fleet praised the vote. Ms. Thomas who had publicly supported the industry said the outcome was a åÛåÏcompromise on deep-sea fishing that doesnåÛåªt pit the environment against jobs but combines them.åÛå         Maria Damanaki the European fisheries commissioner had supported a ban. But she said in a statement on Tuesday that she was åÛåÏready to facilitate constructive three-party discussionsåÛå to reconcile ParliamentåÛåªs decision with the views of the European Commission and the more staunchly pro-industry fisheries ministers of the 28 European Union member states. åÛåÏWe must work together to protect the vulnerable deep-sea species and their habitatsåÛå she said.         The vote caps a year in which Ms. Damanaki  led an overhaul  of the blocåÛåªs fisheries policy and  headed off industry efforts  to create new subsidies for European fishers. The fishing fleet already has much more capacity than can be sustainably employed in EuropeåÛåªs overexploited waters.         While the measures endorsed by the Parliament fell short of what Ms. Damanaki had hoped for they did bring European regulations more in line with those of the United States and other countries which have moved in recent years to prohibit or sharply restrict deep-sea trawling in their own waters and on the high seas.         The measure drew unusual media attention for a fisheries vote with an online campaign  tied to a comic strip  by a French illustrator PÌÄå©nÌÄå©lope Bagieu attracting nearly 750000 signatures opposing the industry.         Javier Garat president of EuropÌÄå»che an industry lobby called the attempt to prohibit deep-sea trawling åÛåÏa very dangerous precedentåÛå saying opponents want åÛåÏto prohibit bottom trawling everywhere and this is just a first step.åÛå

But on Oct. 9 Mr. Shi was unable to make it to work and checked into a hospital his family says. Soon after he was pronounced dead of pneumonia. Although his identification papers said he was 20 Mr. Shi was in fact just 15.         In China he was too young to legally work on a factory floor.         The Pegatron Corporation the Taiwanese manufacturer that employed him said the workplace environment at the Shanghai plant was not the cause of his illness. But a spokeswoman acknowledged that several other young workers at the factory had also died in the past few months.         Labor rights activists say Pegatron has failed to explain at least five deaths of young workers in recent months. They say workers interviewed by China Labor Watch a nonprofit group that monitors working conditions in China have complained about long working hours and harsh working conditions at Pegatron including some of the same pressures that in previous years led to health and safety problems at Foxconn Technology AppleåÛåªs biggest contract supplier in China.         åÛåÏConsidering the sudden deaths of five people and the similar reason of the deaths we believe there should be some relations between the tragedy and the working conditions in the factoryåÛå said Li Qiang who runs China Labor Watch.         Apple declined to comment on Tuesday on the deaths at Pegatron. But the company has gone to great lengths in the last few years to improve conditions at the manufacturing facilities that produce Apple products in China. It has stepped up audits insisted on new safety measures and supported higher wages and tighter restrictions on working hours.         Apple has even diversified its mix of suppliers with companies like Pegatron which helps assemble AppleåÛåªs iPhones and iPads in China according to people familiar with its operations.         While Pegatron says it strictly forbids its factories from hiring workers under 16 the legal working age in China Mr. Shi was able to work using a falsified identity card. In his only month at Pegatron he worked nearly 280 hours often 12 hours a day six days a week according to work documents his family kept.         AppleåÛåªs supplier responsibility statement bars employees of supplier companies in China from working more than 60 hours a week; so does Chinese law. But Mr. Shi worked 79 hours in his first week 77 in his second and 75 in his third all apparently in violation of the law according to documents provided by his family.         Pegatron said that the work logs the family kept are records of when the young man clocked in and out and may not include breaks. The company said his hours did not exceed the legal limit.         åÛåÏThis is not related to the workplace environmentåÛå Ming Tsai a Pegatron spokeswoman said Tuesday referring to the young manåÛåªs death.         In late July China Labor Watch released a report claiming that Pegatron was violating Chinese laws and AppleåÛåªs own social responsibility code of conduct. Among other things the group said that Pegatron was forcing employees to work unpaid overtime.         Executives at Pegatron which has 100000 workers in Shanghai said they were taking the accusations seriously.         The company spokeswoman said that Pegatron was deeply distraught by the deaths of the workers but that an investigation of the working conditions in the Shanghai factory found nothing unusual no toxic chemicals or other hazards.         The company tried to resolve the case of Shi Zhaokun by paying his family compensation of about 90000 renminbi or about $15000 according to Shi ZhaokunåÛåªs uncle Yang Sen.         But on Tuesday Mr. Yang insisted the matter was still not resolved. He said something must have gone wrong at the Pegatron workplace. On Sept. 4 he said his nephew passed a pre-employment physical and was declared healthy.

Not that thereåÛåªs anything wrong with cheese and crackers. ItåÛåªs just that after the third party or so my enthusiasm for even the ripest artisanal cave-aged wedge starts to wane.         Consider this savory apple tart an antidote. It hits all the requisite cheesy alcohol-sopping notes but itåÛåªs more sophisticated and a lot more substantial.         In order to make this tart particularly hearty I fortified the chewy pizza-like crust with three kinds of flour. ThereåÛåªs all-purpose for lightness whole wheat for heft and nuttiness and cornmeal for sweetness and a slight crunch. The downside is that you need to make the yeasted dough ahead so that it can rise. But thatåÛåªs also the upside if you like to do things in advance and the dough does very well rising overnight in the refrigerator. Just make sure to bring it to room temperature before trying to flatten it out or you wonåÛåªt get very far.         As for the topping itåÛåªs a comforting mellow jumble of sweet roasted apples and shallots thatåÛåªs scented with thyme and zipped up with pungent blue cheese. Blue-cheese haters fear not; you can substitute another variety just as long as itåÛåªs pronouncedly stinky. All those gentle caramelized flavors need something strident to perk them up.         Although this tart is best served warm within an hour or two of baking you can make it in the morning and serve it the same night (reheat it in a 325-degree oven for about 20 minutes). But donåÛåªt leave it longer than that. By the next morning both the apples and the crust will have wilted into a sad and rather tired state. Or freeze the unbaked tart then pop it into the oven while itåÛåªs still frozen (it will need an extra 20 to 30 minutes).         To serve this at a big party cut the tart into bite-size squares for easy consumption. For a smaller group serve it like focaccia alongside grilled sausages or baked ham. Its amenable nature means it will fit in well with practically any holiday meal in an elegant and unexpected way. Which is a lot more than you can say about cheese and crackers.         ÌâåÊ

Akerson  who has run the company since mid-2010 is stepping down in January. Replacing him as chief executive is Mary Barra who despite 33 years of service at the automaker has mostly sidestepped the taint of prebankruptcy failures. G.M. freshly liberated from the government bailout also on Tuesday appointed an independent chairman for good governance measure. Ms. Barra an engineer by training has a reputation for both good design and keeping a firm handle on costs. As head of global product development she has overseen improved vehicles for G.M. as well as held her division‰Ûªs $15 billion budget under control. Much of the restraint derives from a reduction in the number of platforms used to build the company‰Ûªs cars and trucks in something of a nod to the ‰ÛÏOne Ford‰Û strategy imposed several years ago by Ford‰Ûªs boss  Alan R. Mulally . The incoming G.M. chief also has shown a knack for shredding bureaucracy. Just one executive now oversees the development of each vehicle compared with three before. And in a stint as head of human resources after the 2009 bailout Ms. Barra slashed everything like a 10-page dress code and the number of reports required by human resources. It‰Ûªs just the kind of thinking G.M. needs to spread as it chases more profitable rivals. Its pretax margin is about 8 percent in North America and 5 percent globally. That‰Ûªs not bad especially considering problems it and other carmakers face in Europe. Ford however regularly exceeds 10 percent in its home market and 7 percent worldwide.  Ms. Barra‰Ûªs promotion is one of many planned inside G.M.‰Ûªs Renaissance Center headquarters in Detroit. Theodore Solso will take over Mr. Akerson‰Ûªs role as chairman. Though he is an existing board member Mr. Solso is also independent and brings helpful expertise from his time running the engine and fuel systems manufacturer  Cummins . A good crop of newly announced lieutenants will surround the incoming chief executive too meaning the right people should be at the wheel. G.M. also is now fully free to shift into a higher gear after the United States Treasury sold the last of its stake on Monday. It‰Ûªs all down to whether Ms. Barra can steer the course.

Five years earlier in 2007 he had two breakout roles: åÛåÏGone Baby GoneåÛå directed by his older brother Ben and åÛåÏThe Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert FordåÛå in which he played the coward Robert Ford and for which he received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. In the years following though he had starred in only two live-action films (and provided a voice for the cartoon åÛåÏParaNormanåÛå). His most recent and notorious creative project was in 2010 when he poured his heart brain and wallet into åÛåÏIåÛåªm Still HereåÛå a passion project he made with his brother-in-law and close friend Joaquin Phoenix. The hoax-documentary purported to chronicle PhoenixåÛåªs real-life personal implosion as he supposedly made the switch from acting to a rap career. The film not only met with many terrible reviews but actually seemed to enrage the media. Dana Stevens of Slate had a not untypical critical reaction: åÛåÏThe worst thing about åÛå÷IåÛåªm Still HereåÛåª is the fact that it exists.åÛå         So when Affleck started shooting åÛåÏOut of the FurnaceåÛå an ambitious film about two brothers in steel-town Pennsylvania he was looking to regain something. During a scene sitting across from his co-star Christian Bale he realized what that thing was. åÛåÏWhat I saw Christian doing was I felt like some of the best acting that IåÛåªve ever seenåÛå Affleck says. åÛåÏYou know when you sort of forget what you like about movies and then you see a movie again that reminds you of why you fell in love with them in the first place? That was the experience.åÛå After his first day of shooting Affleck called Matt Damon whom he has known since he was 5 and who happened also to be nearby in Pittsburgh making a different film åÛåÏPromised Land.åÛå         åÛåÏHe came over for dinner and he was bummed outåÛå Damon told me. åÛåÏCasey has always been very hard on himself. But he was 35 heåÛåªs not a kid anymore and he was genuinely disturbed about what had happened. He had just done a scene with Bale and he had been so blown away by what Christian had done åÛåÓ and it wasnåÛåªt anything remarkable; it was a difficult scene but what Christian had to do was relatively simple he wasnåÛåªt pulling any tricks. He was genuine and honest and real.åÛå According to Damon Casey told him that by comparison åÛåÏI was just pulling faces.åÛå          åÛåÏCaseyåÛåªs easily one  of the best actors of his generationåÛå Scott Cooper his director on åÛåÏOut of the FurnaceåÛå said to me. åÛåÏIn many cases you hear someone say Well this guyåÛåªs underrated. That might be true among the general populace but with Casey among his peers he is certainly not underrated.åÛå Cooper who directed Jeff BridgesåÛåªs Oscar-winning performance in åÛåÏCrazy HeartåÛå had thought of Affleck specifically for the role of Rodney Baze Jr. åÛåÓ a P.T.S.D.-addled vet who turns to drinking and bare-knuckle boxing as a way of paying off gambling debts and grappling with his inner violence.         Despite this affection within Hollywood circles and despite the fact that his brother (Ben) and his childhood friend (Matt Damon) have become two of the most famous men in the world Affleck finds himself perpetually poised on the verge of being discovered by a larger audience. Yet heåÛåªs also shown an apparent inability to make that leap åÛåÓ to escape the trap of being known simply as the other Affleck. This isnåÛåªt just a symptom of an easily distracted public eye. To a large extent itåÛåªs self-imposed åÛåÓ you might even say self-inflicted.         He tells me he decided åÛåÏpretty early onåÛå that he was chronically uncomfortable with the demands of celebrity åÛåÏbut itåÛåªs mostly because I knew that I wasnåÛåªt good at it. . . . It didnåÛåªt feel good to me and I wasnåÛåªt pulling it off.åÛå AffleckåÛåªs discomfort with the topic is palpable åÛåÓ and also notable given that Ben and Damon have both proved to be excellent at being famous. Ben Affleck despite some early struggles with fame has since enjoyed a redemptive comeback that culminated in an Oscar win. Damon is rare among superstar actors: heåÛåªs managed to keep his private life more or less private his artistic choices are consistently interesting and he still finds time to star in viral videos cursing out Jimmy Kimmel.

Oregon held a music contest and California stresses the åÛåÏpeace of mindåÛå that will come with insurance.         The state and federal health insurance exchanges are using all manner of humor and happy talk to sell the  Affordable Care ActåÛåªs  products. But the one part of the new system that they are not quick to trumpet is the financial penalty that Americans will face if they fail to buy insurance.         On state exchange websites mention of the penalty is typically tucked away under åÛåÏfrequently asked questionsåÛå if it appears at all. Television and print ads usually skip the issue and operators of exchange telephone banks are instructed to discuss it only if asked. The federal website now infamous for its glitches  mentions the penalty  but also calls it a fee or an Individual Shared Responsibility Payment.         The euphemisms and avoidance of any discussion of the penalty are no accident both supporters and critics of the law say. While the mandate for all Americans to buy health insurance åÛåÓ with a penalty if they do not åÛåÓ was the linchpin of the  Supreme Court decision  upholding the law and is considered the key to its success poll after poll has found that it is also the least popular part of the program.         State exchange operators say that they are not trying to hide the penalty but that their market research has taught them that at least in the initial phase consumers will be more receptive to soothing messages and appeals to their sense of collective responsibility than to threats of punishment.         åÛåÏWe feel that the carrot is better than the stickåÛå said Larry Hicks a spokesman for  Covered California . åÛåÏThis is a new endeavor. We want people to come in and test our wares.åÛå         But there is also the dirty little secret of the penalty: It is a bit of a chimera because the federal government cannot use its usual tools like fines liens or criminal prosecutions to punish people who do not pay it. The penalty is supposed to be reported and paid with the income tax returns of those who do not buy insurance but the government has not said how it will collect from those who owe it but do not pay it though the law allows it to deduct from any income tax refunds.         åÛåÏIt might be that they want to be positiveåÛå said  Michael Cannon  director of health policy studies at the conservative Cato Institute. åÛåÏBut itåÛåªs also the case that an informed customer is not their best customer.åÛå         And for many healthy middle-class people a side-by-side comparison might suggest that it would be more cost-effective to pay the penalty than to buy insurance.         In 2014 a family with two adults and two or more children for example would pay $285 or 1 percent of the familyåÛåªs income over the $20300 filing threshold whichever is greater; those jump to $2085 or 2.5 percent by 2016 and rise with inflation after that.         For instance a family of four making $59000 a year could face a choice between a $387 penalty the first year or in a typical åÛåÏsilveråÛå or midpriced policy offered on the California exchange a premium of nearly $4800 after the federal subsidy with a $4000 deductible according to the Kaiser Family Foundation  subsidy calculator . There is variation from plan to plan but the deductible typically would not apply to doctor visits preventive care lab tests or generic drugs although some regular co-payments would apply.         åÛåÏAre they going to buy it?åÛå said Robert Laszewski president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates a health care industry consultant in Alexandria Va. åÛåÏI donåÛåªt mean this as an attack on Obamacare. I think itåÛåªs a difficult political problem.åÛå         The federal website which serves residents of 36 states appears to acknowledge this problem in a  not-quite-threatening way : åÛåÏIf someone who can afford health insurance doesnåÛåªt have coverage in 2014 they may have to pay a fee. They also have to pay for all of their health care.åÛå         The penalty despite its unpopularity is the glue that holds the Affordable Care Act together. Unless people are forced to buy insurance health policy experts say young and healthy people may stay away leaving only the more expensive patients in the plans which will quickly drive up premiums. And it was the penalty that the United States Supreme Court relied on to uphold the individual mandate reasoning that it was a legal use of CongressåÛåªs taxing authority.         The sotto-voce treatment of the penalty resembles the strategy Massachusetts used when it set up its universal health insurance program several years ago. It took a sales approach at first using the Red Sox in its campaign to appeal to men who tend to be a little more resentful of being pushed into something said Jon Kingsdale the executive director for the first four years.         In November 2007 with barely two months left to sign up his state began emphasizing the penalty and volume soared he said. åÛåÏThat was very effective as a call to actionåÛå Mr. Kingsdale said.         Directors of state exchanges said that as happened in Massachusetts a new phase of advertising that incorporates the penalty may kick in as the sign-up deadline approaches. Last month the Obama administration said people who signed up for coverage by March 31 would avoid the penalty; previously the date was Feb. 15.

But often such payment plans can have surprising costs for patients and can end up putting them in debt said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. On Tuesday the agency announced that it was ordering GE Capital Retail Bank and its CareCredit medical credit card unit to refund up to $34.1 million to pay customers who it said were victims of deceptive credit-card enrollment tactics over the last several years. More than one million patients who may have wrongly accrued charges on their card could be eligible for reimbursement.         Richard Cordray the bureauåÛåªs director said the agency had received hundreds of complaints about the card and found that many patients who were offered it thought they were signing up for an interest-free payment plan. But in fact they were applying for a deferred-interest credit card that had a no-interest promotional period of up to two years. Interest accrued during the promotion at an annual rate of 26.99 percent åÛåÒ much higher than a typical bank credit card he said. If the balance wasnåÛåªt paid by the end of the promotional period the patient became liable for the interest resulting in åÛåÏa very expensive loanåÛå he said.         Other similar credit cards are available but CareCredit is one of the largest in the industry the bureau said. It is offered by about 175000 doctors dentists vision care and veterinary offices across the country. There are about four million active CareCredit cardholders.         Providers like the cards because they get paid up front but the cards can get unwitting patients into debt at a time when they may not be fully focused on financial details. åÛåÏTheyåÛåªre not on guard financiallyåÛå he said. åÛåÏTheir focus is on getting better.åÛå         Many patients did not receive copies of the credit agreement he said but relied on oral explanations from office staff members who often received little training.         Mr. Cordray said the bureauåÛåªs order found that CareCredit had engaged in åÛåÏharmful consumer practicesåÛå since January 2009. Under the order GE Capital Retail bank will provide clear disclosures about CareCredit so customers fully understand the product and bank representatives will contact most patients within 72 hours to explain the product over the phone. For some transactions over $1000 patients must enroll directly through a CareCredit representative rather than through a staff member of the doctor or dentiståÛåªs office. The company must also notify customers when the promotional period is ending.         åÛåÏ Deferred-interest products  can be risky for consumers in the best of circumstances and todayåÛåªs action ensures that CareCredit will no longer profit from consumer confusionåÛå Mr. Cordray said.         Dori Abel a spokeswoman for GE Capital said the company worked cooperatively with the bureau and had committed to providing more education about the card for medical providers and consumers. She said the company had åÛåÏconsistentlyåÛå seen high customer satisfaction with the CareCredit card along with repeat use among clients.         The bureau said in part because GE Capital Retail Bank cooperated with the bureau there was no additional fine or penalty imposed.         Here are some additional questions about medical payment cards:         åĞåÊ  How will consumers receive reimbursement?   GE Capital Retail Bank is responsible for notifying consumers that they may be eligible for payment and what the claims process is the bureau said. Claims will be reviewed by an åÛåÏindependent adjudicator.åÛå The consent order is available on the  bureauåÛåªs website .          åĞåÊ   Are all payment options offered in medical offices some sort of deferred credit product?   No. Some doctors and hospitals do offer no-interest payment plans administered by outside contractors to patients who cannot pay their bills all at once.  If patients donåÛåªt pay as agreed  the account goes back to the hospital for possible collection.         åĞåÊ  What should I do if I am offered a payment plan at a dental or medical office?   Make sure you understand the terms of the payment plan the bureau advises and insist on a copy in writing so you can review it later.

The drafters were members of something called  the Uniform Law Commission  whose job it is to propose model legislation that the states can then adopt if they so choose. Today 41 states have the law or some variant of it on their books.         The law essentially criminalizes most contact between sports agents and college athletes åÛåÓ something that heretofore had merely been a violation of N.C.A.A. rules. Agents who give athletes money are now violating the law. åÛåÏRunnersåÛå who act as go-betweens for agents are violating the law. Agents who donåÛåªt announce to the university that they want to talk to an enrolled athlete are violating the law. It is a measure of how good a job the N.C.A.A. has done in brainwashing the country that the simple act of handing money to åÛåÓ or giving advice to åÛåÓ a college student is now against the law in most of the country when the recipient happens to play a sport.         (And you wonder why so many college football and menåÛåªs basketball players come out of school so ill-equipped for life?  According to Sports Illustrated  some 78 percent of professional football players are either bankrupt or in serious financial trouble within two years of their retirement. Maybe if the N.C.A.A. encouraged players to get agents while they were still in school instead of criminalizing such contact athletes would be a little better prepared for what comes afterward. Instead the N.C.A.A. views this activity as the work of åÛåÏunscrupulous agentsåÛå who are åÛåÏvictimizingåÛå athletes. But I digress.)         Still on anyoneåÛåªs list of criminal activities slipping a few bucks to the middle linebacker has to rank pretty low. Which perhaps explains why so far as I can tell no one had ever been indicted before for violating the law.         Until last month that is. ThatåÛåªs when Jim Woodall the top prosecutor in Orange County N.C. egged on by the North Carolina Secretary of StateåÛåªs Office which had conducted a lengthy investigation  indicted five people  for funneling åÛåÏillegalåÛå benefits to three former University of North Carolina football players.         At the center of this åÛåÏconspiracyåÛå is  a small-time agent named Terry Watson  who in 2010 is alleged to have given the three athletes in question a total of around $24000. What he hoped for was that the players would use him as their agent when they went pro. (They didnåÛåªt.) The charge is åÛåÏathlete agent inducement.åÛå         The other four were indicted on charges of being the supposed go-betweens. It is one of those alleged go-betweens I want to briefly focus on. It used to be that the N.C.A.A. could only wreck the lives of athletes. Now it appears thanks to the Uniform Athlete Agents Act nonathletes can also have their lives wrecked by the N.C.A.A.         Between 2007 and 2009 Jennifer Wiley Thompson was an academic adviser for North Carolina athletes. Her original crime in the eyes of the N.C.A.A. was giving athletes a little too much help. She wasnåÛåªt writing papers for them but she was helping them make them better. When the football team became mired in a scandal in 2010 the help she had given became public knowledge. She in turn became a focal point in the news media. She not only lost her position as an academic adviser but she lost her day job teaching grade school kids.         She has since lost a second job åÛåÓ and now faces the prospect of jail time for  allegedly passing money to a player for plane tickets . åÛåÏThey are doing this because she helped people with their homework?åÛå said Joseph Cheshire her lawyer. åÛåÏIt is ridiculous. We donåÛåªt see where she broke the law. WeåÛåªre going to war on this.åÛå         It is a war well worth waging. There is virtually no precedent to look to so this case is likely to determine whether this law has any teeth. If the Orange County district attorney succeeds in his effort to prosecute the North Carolina five it will mean that other prosecutors in other jurisdictions will follow suit. Going after someone who has tainted dear old State U. will be irresistible.         If on the other hand the cases go to trial and they are found not guilty the law will be rendered meaningless even if it remains on the books.         Meanwhile in late October a committee of the Uniform Law Commission met in Chicago to discuss revisions to åÛåÓ what else? åÛåÓ the Uniform Athlete Agents Act. According to Richard T. Cassidy who writes the blog åÛåÏ On Lawyering åÛå the plan is to åÛåÏexpand the scope of the law and improve its effectiveness.åÛå One proposal is to have the law cover high school and even elementary school athletes.         Thus does the long arm of the N.C.A.A. get that much longer.

But on a recent evening the Dutch novelist  Arnon Grunberg  was sitting at a cluttered desk in his shoe-box apartment in Midtown Manhattan with more reason to kvetch than most.         First there was the novella he was trying to get off the ground the latest in a string of more than a dozen books that have made him at 42 perhaps his countryåÛåªs most celebrated novelist and a literary star in Europe.         But more pressing åÛåÓÌâåÊquite literally åÛåÓ was his headgear a sort of bathing cap affixed with 28 electrodes that made him look like an extra in a mermaid mash-up of åÛåÏA Clockwork Orange.åÛå         åÛåÏAfter about a half-hour your head starts to hurtåÛå Mr. Grunberg said as a technician from a Dutch software company carefully poured water over some of the electrodes to improve their conductivity. åÛåÏAlso it can get a bit drippy.åÛå         The cap the novella and the technician were all part of Mr. GrunbergåÛåªs  latest project  a literary stunt turned lab experiment that combines the rigor of academic neuroscience with the self-obsessive spirit of the  åÛåÏquantified selfåÛå  movement which has inspired people to track (and broadcast) the minutiae of their lives down to the last step taken penny spent and milligram of caffeine ingested.         Over the past two weeks Mr. Grunberg has spent several hours a day writing his novella while a battery of sensors and cameras tracked his brain waves heart rate galvanic skin response (an electrical measure of emotional arousal) and facial expressions. Next fall when the book is published some 50 ordinary people in the Netherlands will read it under similarly controlled circumstances sensors and all.         Researchers will then crunch the data in the hope of finding patterns that may help illuminate links between the way art is created and enjoyed and possibly the nature of creativity itself.         åÛåÏWill readers of ArnonåÛåªs text feel they understand or embody the same emotions he had while he was writing it or is reading a completely different process?åÛå said Ysbrand van der Werf a researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience and the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam who designed the experiment with Jan van Erp of the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research. åÛåÏThese are some of the questions we want to answer.åÛå         This experiment is connected with the burgeoning field of neuroaesthetics which over the last decade or so has attempted to uncover the neural underpinnings of our experience of music and visual art using brain imaging technology. Slowly a small but growing number of researchers have also begun using similar tools to scrutinize the perhaps more elusive and perhaps endangered experience of literary reading.         Last year researchers at Stanford University drew headlines with the results of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (or fMRI) experiment showing that different regions of the brain were activated when subjects switched from  reading Jane AustenåÛåªs åÛåÏMansfield ParkåÛå   for pleasure to reading it analytically. And this fall a  study  out of the New School for Social Research showed that readers of literary fiction scored higher on tests of empathy than readers of commercial fiction a finding greeted with satisfied told-you-sos from many readers and writers alike.         Mr. Grunberg however seems to be the first novelist to submit not just his work but also his own creative processes to direct scientific scrutiny. And he claims no investment in the idea that his darkly satirical and piety-poking books åÛåÓ including the recently translated  åÛåÏTirzaåÛå  praised in The New York Times Book Review as åÛåÏnever less than enthrallingåÛå if åÛåÏnot always enjoyableåÛå åÛåÓ will be shown to be socially or morally edifying.         åÛåÏI donåÛåªt think this experiment needs to prove that literature can be good for youåÛå he said. åÛåÏSometimes literature can actually be dangerous if you take it seriously.åÛå         Mr. Grunberg the son of German-born Holocaust survivors has become a celebrity in the Netherlands precisely by treating the business of being a writer as a bit of a lark his admirers say.         His first novel åÛåÏBlue MondaysåÛå åÛåÓ written after he had dropped out of high school failed as an actor and then gone bankrupt as a publisher åÛåÓ became a best seller and won a prestigious Dutch prize for the best first novel of 1994. Six years later a minor scandal ensued after he won the prize again with  åÛåÏThe Story of My BaldnessåÛå  written as Marek van der Jagt a fictional author who had taken some public whacks at Arnon Grunberg for good measure.         Although Mr. Grunberg has lived mostly in New York since 1995 he can seem omnipresent in the Netherlands: writing a daily 150-word column for the front page of The Volkskrant a leading newspaper; conducting regular public interviews with prominent politicians scientists and artists; even lending his name to a wine company (its first blend: Freud). He can also seem to be everywhere else thanks to his newspaper articles based on his experiences embedded with troops in Afghanistan with dining car waiters on a Swiss train with masseurs at a Romanian resort with patients in a Belgian psychiatric ward (where he received most of the treatments he said) and even with an ordinary Dutch family on vacation.         åÛåÏSometimes it seems like heåÛåªs living five different lives next to each otheråÛå said Garrelt Verhoeven the chief curator of special collections at the Amsterdam University Library which will be organizing an  exhibition   about Mr. GrunbergåÛåªs career next October. åÛåÏHeåÛåªs very serious but itåÛåªs also part of a game for him.åÛå         The current experiment Mr. Grunberg said emerged out of a desire to play with the darker possibilities of e-reader technology. If Amazon can track where Kindle users stop reading he wondered how else might an author be able to spy on his audience?         His Dutch publisher Nijgh & Van Ditmar persuaded him to make himself part of the experiment. And once he connected with the neuroscientists the transformation from provocateur to guinea pig was complete.         åÛåÏI was just the objectåÛå he said. åÛåÏItåÛåªs like having someone else embedded in my own brain.åÛå         But the real quantitative science will come later Mr. van der Werf said when the researchers measure the novellaåÛåªs effect on the 50 readers. They have asked Mr. Grunberg to try to keep each chunk of text limited to one dominant emotion and have tracked where his cursor was at various points in each writing session to match his words with the physiological data. The 50 readers will read the novella on an e-reader to allow similar tracking.         Mr. Grunberg who estimated that he would take another five months to finish the book said the sensors have interfered less with his creative process than he feared but he did allow that the experiment itself might end up figuring in the book which he said will address issues of privacy and cybersecurity.         And he admitted to sometimes staring up at the cameras after the technician had left wondering if they were really off.         åÛåÏI find myself having all these fantasiesåÛå he said åÛåÏlike that I was part of an experiment supposedly looking at my brain while I was writing but the real point was something else entirely.åÛå

Five years ago she moved to New York from her native Maryland rooming with a friend near Gramercy Park a few blocks from her office.         Two years later she moved to the Upper East Side with her boyfriend Eric Zinger whom she subsequently married. They shared a 700-square-foot one-bedroom in a postwar high-rise.         Their apartment had a beautiful view and new appliances though it was bland inside. åÛåÏIf youåÛåªve seen one youåÛåªve seen a thousandåÛå Mr. Zinger said. The rent started around $2400 a month rose to $2600 and was scheduled to hit $2900.         The place was not without problems. Whenever the oven was on the smoke alarm blared. Once when she went to pick up her wash from the building laundry room Mrs. Zinger found her clean clothes in a wet heap. Someone had removed her load from the dryer. åÛåÏThey stole $3 worth of minutesåÛå she said. åÛåÏWho does that?åÛå         The buildingåÛåªs elevators were perpetually sluggish. During the morning rush they were sometimes so full that to get a spot Mrs. Zinger had to go up before going down.         As for her No. 6 train commute to Midtown åÛåÏI could not handle it at allåÛå she said. åÛåÏI was not ready for the pushing and the intensity.åÛå She often arrived late and upset to her office where she works as an auditor.         Mr. Zinger who works in financial services left home early enough every morning to beat the rush hour. åÛåÏI would have 100 percent traded my commute for hersåÛå he said. åÛåÏI am a loud outgoing New Yorker.åÛå         It was about a year ago that the Zingers both 29 åÛåÓ who met as students at the University of Maryland åÛåÓ decided to hunt for a two-story house to buy in Westchester County.         They wanted three bedrooms and two bathrooms not far from a train station. Their budget was $350000 to $450000.         Online the Zingers found Ann Bernstein an agent at Houlihan LawrenceåÛåªs White Plains office. Ms. Bernstein would pick them up at the station and shepherd them around on what she called a åÛåÏtown touråÛå which they found helpful.         åÛåÏSeeing something is totally different from looking on Google Street ViewåÛå Mr. Zinger said. åÛåÏAnn didnåÛåªt rush us from house to house. She would take the long way so we could get the feel of a neighborhood.åÛå         Initially the Zingers were impressed by the size of houses. åÛåÏEverything seemed great because it wasnåÛåªt a 700-square-foot apartmentåÛå Mr. Zinger said. åÛåÏThree bedrooms? Great.åÛå         But they found less appealing features too. One house had a steep driveway. Another was adjacent to the interstate. One was next to a fenced-in yard with a dog.         The Zingers could tell right away whether a place would work for them. åÛåÏThere was nothing we thought about or debatedåÛå Mr. Zinger said.         So they quickly knew they were interested in a center-hall colonial on Longview Avenue in White Plains. The house an estate sale was at the upper end of their budget. They offered the asking price $450000.         Mrs. Zinger even wrote a letter to the sellers about what good owners they would be. But the sellers were more interested in another bidderåÛåªs best and final offer. åÛåÏWe were young and naÌÄåøve and it didnåÛåªt workåÛå Mr. Zinger said. The house sold for $455000.         A house on Waldo Avenue in White Plains had a pretty porch and a basement that could be finished. The asking price was $475000. The couple offered $440000 then $452500.         But someone else came along and bought the house for $475000. åÛåÏWe were a little hurt by thatåÛå Mrs. Zinger said.         Finally last spring they saw a three-bedroom two-bath Cape-style house in Hartsdale. The price had dropped to $394000 from $449000. Taxes were around $13000 a year.         The previous owner had paid $521000 in 2006 åÛåÏso you donåÛåªt have to be a real estate analyst to figure out what happened thereåÛå Mr. Zinger said.         The transaction for $387500 was a short sale involving åÛåÏmany complications requiring several levels of bank approvalåÛå Ms. Bernstein said. It took six months to close.         The Zingers arrived in the early fall. åÛåÏWe spent a lot of money on closing costs and moving costsåÛå Mr. Zinger said. åÛåÏEverything is more expensive than you think and thereåÛåªs 10 different things you didnåÛåªt think of.åÛå         They painted the entire interior eradicating the many pastels and replaced the carpeting upstairs. Now they are working to fill their space. åÛåÏItåÛåªs a lot of funåÛå Mrs. Zinger said.         Maintenance issues are new to them. During one rainstorm noisy squirrels sought shelter in the walls. They had to hire an exterminator and add insulation. The washing machine has already broken.         But the suburban spaciousness provides much-appreciated relief. The supermarkets have more selection and bigger packages. åÛåÏYou can get a huge box for twice the price of a tiny little thingåÛå Mrs. Zinger said. åÛåÏYou have the room to take advantage of sales.åÛå         The Metro-North commute almost always with a seat takes 49 minutes but seems shorter. On Fridays the Zingers travel home together drinking a train beer on the way.         He is contented with the commute; she is ecstatic. åÛåÏI would take 40 minutes on Metro North over 20 minutes on the 6 train any dayåÛå she said. åÛåÏI was never really made for the city.åÛå

In one  cheeky campaign   AARP  is urging mothers to send e-cards to their children reminding them to sign up. One e-card reads åÛåÏAs a reward for signing up for health insurance IåÛåªll defriend you on Facebook.åÛå Another group Organizing for Action is seeking to steer holiday conversations toward health care by  encouraging parents to have åÛåÏthe talkåÛå  with their adult children. And a Colorado group is  promoting an ad  featuring a hapless young man who calls his mother from the golf course: åÛåÏYo Mom do I got insurance?åÛå         Recruiting enough young people is a major goal of the Obama administration because insurers need healthy customers to offset the cost of caring for those with expensive medical needs.         The goal carries even more urgency now that insurers are considering a proposal by President Obama to let people many of them healthy stay on their existing policies for another year. If fewer of those people buy insurance in the new marketplaces signing up young people without insurance will be even more crucial. Young people also account for a major chunk of the uninsured. About 40 percent of the estimated 41 million uninsured people nationwide who are eligible for coverage are between the ages of 18 and 35  according to the administration .         Even as supporters are enlisting mothers in the effort to sign up their adult children critics have mounted an equally aggressive and well-funded campaign urging young people to åÛåÏopt outåÛå of coverage. Opponents use many of the same marketing tools as the lawåÛåªs supporters reaching out to young people on social media and through web videos.         Advocacy groups and insurers are expected to make a major marketing push beginning in early December when the Obama administration has said it expects the malfunctioning federal health care website to be working better. They have their targets set on two major deadlines: Dec. 23 when insurance must be purchased for coverage beginning on Jan. 1 and March 31 when the open enrollment period will end.         Beneath the marketing campaignsåÛåª playful language is a deeper truth: When it comes to making major life decisions many people åÛåÓ especially young adults åÛåÓ still turn to their mothers for help. More broadly women make about 80 percent of the health care decisions for their families  according to the federal Labor Department .         åÛåÏItåÛåªs the cutest phenomenon everåÛå said Lynn Quincy a senior health policy analyst at Consumers Union who stumbled on the significance of mothers while conducting a focus group of men and women last year about how well people understood the language in their insurance policies. When asked who they turned to for advice about health care the overwhelming answer was their mothers. åÛåÏThese people could have husbands they could have fathers they may have a nurse who lives next door but theyåÛåªre all going to their momsåÛå she said.         Of course the administration and advocacy groups are also reaching out directly to young people themselves collaborating with outlets like the comedy website  Funny or Die  initiating social media campaigns handing out fliers at concerts and  sponsoring a video contest  aimed at getting young people to sign up.         åÛåÏPeople need to have heard about it a couple of times and frankly from a couple of different sourcesåÛå said Jon Carson the executive director of Organizing for Action the nonprofit group that grew out of President ObamaåÛåªs 2012 campaign organization. He said mothers represented just one avenue that they hoped would help persuade a young person to enroll. The recently posted video is part of a campaign called Healthcare for the Holidays that seeks to arm parents with talking points when they see their children at family get-togethers.         This approach may resonate especially well with the so-called millennial generation which came of age in a recession and may still financially depend on their parents say some experts.         åÛåÏMillennials love their parents and they count on them for adviceåÛå said Morley Winograd the  co-author of three books  on the millennial generation. He noted that this might sound surprising to baby boomers who famously rebelled against their parentsåÛåª generation. But millennials åÛåÏassume that their parents have more worldly experience and know about things like money and health insuranceåÛå he said.         Mary Babich the mother of two children in their 20s without insurance said she had been pestering both of them to sign up. åÛåÏThey look at it as just government bureaucracy åÛåÓ as almost akin to filling out their taxesåÛå said Ms. Babich who lives in Wisconsin. She paused and added åÛåÏThe sad thing is IåÛåªve always done both of their taxes.åÛå         The mother-knows-best strategy isnåÛåªt entirely new. In 2007 when Massachusetts introduced its  health care law  officials mailed greeting cards timed for MotheråÛåªs Day to the parents of young men between the ages of 18 and 26. Market research had shown this group was among the most resistant to buying insurance. åÛåÏThe idea was to trigger a phone call from the parent to the child to say åÛå÷Hey by the way do you have insurance?åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå said Kevin J. Counihan who served as chief marketing officer for MassachusettsåÛåªs health insurance marketplace at the time. åÛåÏWe made the hypothesis that we could best reach the young men through their mothers.åÛå         The effort Mr. Counihan said was a moderate success: Many parents decided to pick up the bill for their sonsåÛåª health insurance. And more often than not åÛåÏwe found they bought the most expensive plan because apparently nothing was too good for Johnny.åÛå Mr. Counihan is now chief executive of ConnecticutåÛåªs state marketplace and said he was still targeting the mothers of young men by focusing on churches and community groups where they are likely to be members.         Insurers are also taking note of this influence. Shaun Greene the chief operating officer at  Arches Health Plan  a health care co-op in Utah said he was surprised during a recent televised call-in when he fielded several calls from parents who quickly handed the phone to their children. åÛåÏAt least three of them had their kid by the earåÛå he said explaining: åÛåÏMy son or daughter needs insurance. Talk to them.åÛå         A certain level of concern is just part of being a parent said Nicole Duritz who helped develop the AARP campaign. åÛåÏIåÛåªm a mom and IåÛåªm constantly worried about my kids and making sure theyåÛåªre making good decisionsåÛå she said. åÛåÏAnd health insurance falls into that category.åÛå         ThatåÛåªs certainly true for Lynne Jackier of Ithaca N.Y. who has been helping her 24-year-old daughter look into buying health insurance on the state marketplace. She also has a 26-year-old son who recently moved to California and is also uninsured.         åÛåÏI feel like as parents itåÛåªs our responsibility to get them to look at this nowåÛå Ms. Jackier said.         Her daughter Rosie Simon works as a nanny in Westchester County and said she had been uninsured since graduating from college a few years ago. Although Ms. Simon said that she had heard about the changes coming under the health care law she added that her mother had been persistent in making sure she signed up. Last weekend during a visit home the two sat down at the computer and took the initial steps of completing an application on New YorkåÛåªs marketplace.         Without insurance Ms. Simon said she often delayed going to the doctor when sick or leaned on her parents for help. Ms. Jackier who is on  Medicaid  and so canåÛåªt cover her daughter through private insurance said she had become accustomed to the frustrating conversations. åÛåÏSheåÛåªll get sick and IåÛåªll say åÛå÷You have go to the doctoråÛåªÌâåÊåÛå Ms. Jackier said. åÛåÏAnd sheåÛåªll say åÛå÷Well I donåÛåªt have insurance.åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå         The family had a scare when Ms. Simon recently developed a serious kidney infection. Her parents paid the bill which cost a few hundred dollars. It wasnåÛåªt ideal Ms. Simon said but åÛåÏIåÛåªm still their baby.åÛå

The 27-year-old Trumbo who has blasted 95 home runs during his first three full seasons in the majors will join the Diamondbacks along with two players to be named later one from the Angels and the other from the White Sox.         Trumbo an All-Star in 2012 hit .234 with 34 home runs and 100 RBIs for the Angels this year.         To complete the three-way deal Arizona will shift outfielder Adam Eaton to Chicago and left-handed pitcher Tyler Skaggs to Los Angeles.         Also on Tuesday three-time All-Star outfielder Curtis Granderson officially became a member of the New York Mets after signing a four-year contract worth $60 million.         ""A lot of the people I've met in New York have always said that 'True New Yorkers are Mets fans'"" Granderson told a news conference in Orlando Florida after donning his No. 3 jersey. ""So I'm excited to get a chance to see them all out there.""         Granderson 32 is a career .261 hitter with six seasons of at least 20 home runs and ranks fifth in the majors since 2011 with a homer every 15.3 at-bats.         Winner of the Silver Slugger award in 2011 he became a free agent when his contract with the New York Yankees expired after the 2013 season.         ""He brings a personality. He brings credibility. He brings experience and he brings talent"" Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said of Granderson.         (Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Gene Cherry)        "

Of the 13 states that have so far said they will allow consumers to renew canceled plans all but four are led by Republican governors and have generally been opposed to the new health care law. Of the eight that have said they will not carry out the policy six are in Democratic-led states many of which have actively worked to put the law into effect and have argued that allowing such an extension could undermine its success. They include New York which announced its decision on Tuesday and Massachusetts. Many other states including California and New Jersey are still weighing their options.         The new plans being offered under the Affordable Care Act require that insurers cover a wider range of benefits than many of the old plans. In addition the insurers are prohibited from turning away people with existing medical problems or charging them more.         Mr. ObamaåÛåªs announcement last week came after the political uproar prompted by millions of consumersåÛåª receiving notices that their health plans were being discontinued because they no longer complied with the law.         Many states with low numbers of such cancellations were those that had let insurers temporarily avoid the lawåÛåªs requirements by offering early renewal of existing plans. Those renewals allowed people to keep their existing plans through next year. The goal was to smooth the transition for consumers commissioners in those states said.         åÛåÏIt turned out to be a good decisionåÛå said Mike Chaney the insurance commissioner in Republican-led Mississippi who said fewer than 500 people in his state received notice of discontinued policies because he encouraged the major insurers to offer the option of renewing for an additional year.         Mr. Chaney said insurers could have chosen to cancel policies in his state anyway but åÛåÏI would have hammered them if they did.åÛå         Several other Republican-led states including Oklahoma Utah and New Mexico also reported few cancellations and cited their policies on early renewals as one of the reasons.         However the final decision was up to insurers. For that reason in some states that permitted early renewals there were still hundreds of thousands of canceled policies.         In Florida Kevin McCarty the insurance commissioner said the state allowed insurers to offer customers the option of early renewal.         åÛåÏIf they liked their plan they got to keep their planåÛå he said paraphrasing a comment by Mr. Obama that has been often repeated by critics who say he broke his promise.         But Florida Blue the stateåÛåªs largest insurer decided to discontinue the plans of about 300000 people including 40000 whose coverage will end by Jan. 1. Now it is working to offer those customers the option of extending their plans for an additional year under Mr. ObamaåÛåªs proposal Mr. McCarty said.         Whether the move will ultimately be good for consumers is unclear. Proponents of the health care law including several states that have most enthusiastically embraced it have argued that renewing old plans will undermine the success of the fledging insurance marketplaces. They have also asserted that some of those plans have fewer benefits than new ones devised to comply with the new law.         There is also little indication of how many people who got cancellation notices will decide to renew. They may find better deals on the new insurance marketplace especially if they qualify for tax-credit subsidies.         åÛåÏI do not believe his proposal is a good deal for the State of WashingtonåÛå Mike Kreidler WashingtonåÛåªs state insurance commissioner said in a statement after the presidentåÛåªs announcement last week. Other states that have said they will not put Mr. ObamaåÛåªs proposal into effect are Maryland Massachusetts Minnesota Rhode Island Vermont and Indiana.         Although New York said it did not plan to allow the estimated 100000 canceled policies to be renewed Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo did not completely close the door to the idea.         åÛåÏIf it is causing a problem for someone we will certainly look at itåÛå he said Monday. åÛåÏOur program has actually been working well.åÛå

He seldom referred to the navigational instrument which issued instructions in a feminine monotone as åÛåÏit.åÛå He said åÛåÏsheåÛå and åÛåÏher.åÛå He got a kick out of predicting exactly when sheåÛåªd pipe up and what her advice would be and he alternately complimented himself on his obedience and crowed over his defiance.         åÛåÏSheåÛåªs not going to like thisåÛå heåÛåªd trumpet as he played the rebel going straight instead of left.         åÛåÏRecalculatingåÛå sheåÛåªd sigh and heåÛåªd laugh mischievously.         I thought of them when I saw åÛåÏHeråÛå a new movie that opens in major cities next week.         Joaquin Phoenix stars as a man in love with the operating system for his smartphone-esque device a sexy Siri that åÛåÓ or should I say  who ? åÛåÓ tells him not only when he has mail but what a terrific male he is and does this in Scarlett JohanssonåÛåªs come-hither coo. There was much fuss recently over the decision that Johansson was  ineligible for the Golden Globes : Should a disembodied voiceåÛåªs contribution be regarded as any less real than a visible palpable personåÛåªs? The debate echoed questions in the movie itself which was written and directed by Spike Jonze and was just named the best picture of 2013 by both the National Board of Review and (in a tie with åÛåÏGravityåÛå) the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.          åÛåÏHeråÛå  is sure to be a talker. Set perhaps a few decades from now when Los Angeles has sprouted so many skyscrapers that it resembles Shanghai the story is in one sense absurdist. Man and operating system spend a warm day at the beach. Man and operating system spend a hot night in bed.         But it simultaneously feels like the logical extrapolation of the way we log in now and itåÛåªs an all-you-can-eat allegory buffet. Choose your metaphor or cautionary tale åÛåÓ about the seductions of cyberspace; about how physically disconnected we are; about the shifting terms of intimacy åÛåÓ and itåÛåªs here in abundance first and second and third helpings of it.         I savored a few themes in particular. One is the InternetåÛåªs extreme indulgence of the seemingly innate human impulse to contrive a habitat thatåÛåªs entirely unthreatening an ego-stroking ecosystem a sensibility-controlled comfort zone.         You want an endless stream of irony? You can have an endless stream of irony. You want unfettered invective about the politicians youåÛåªve decided to hate? Set your bookmarks and social-media feeds accordingly. You can frolic endlessly in foregone conclusions. You can revel in the anecdotes that affirm your cynicism or articulate your fantasies gullibly believing whatåÛåªs actually performance art like a young television produceråÛåªs tweet-by-tweet account of his smackdown of an annoying fellow passenger on a Thanksgiving flight. He was briefly a hero his valor gone viral until he revealed that  heåÛåªd made the whole thing up .         In åÛåÏHeråÛå the very nature of JohanssonåÛåªs operating system is to adapt to and evolve from her interactions with Phoenix. SheåÛåªs a projection of his needs. She blooms in accordance with his wants (and has an aurally explosive orgasm on cue). He neednåÛåªt doubt himself compromise or color outside the lines. åÛåÏHeråÛå takes whatåÛåªs happening in American politics and so much of American culture and transfers it to the realm of romance.         ItåÛåªs a parable of narcissism in the digital world which lets you sprint to the foreground of everything giving you an audience or the illusion of one. To monitor Facebook or Twitter right after Nelson MandelaåÛåªs death last week was to be struck by how many people werenåÛåªt so much passing along the news as laying claim to it: HereåÛåªs what I thought of him. HereåÛåªs when I intersected with him. HereåÛåªs the personal reverberation.         But åÛåÏHeråÛå also traces the flip side of the coin åÛåÓ that with our amassed knowledge and scientific accomplishments we may be succeeding in rendering ourselves obsolete. Around the same time that I saw the movie Jeff Bezos sketched out his plans for  delivery by drone . The Times published a front-page account of GoogleåÛåªs  grand designs for robots  in manufacturing and shipping. And a video producer I know returned from a shoot at a food production plant shocked that she hadnåÛåªt laid eyes on many people. Just a small posse of engineers and a slew of machines.         Economists have sounded the alarm about what this could mean for employment and the distribution of wealth. It falls to artists to contemplate what this could mean for psyches and souls and åÛåÏHeråÛå imagines a society in which human beings are so thoroughly marginalized that theyåÛåªre being edited out of courtship and companionship because theyåÛåªre superfluous messy. ItåÛåªs a love story as horror story. If we no longer need anyone in the passenger seat do we need anyone at all?

Granderson was the biggest free-agent signing of AldersonåÛåªs tenure as the general manager. He was the newest face of the franchise the cleanup hitter to team with David Wright.         The news conference started and Granderson said hi to his mother. He said he stayed in New York to continue his charity work. He poked fun at the Yankees. He was confident clean-cut charming and funny. He seemed likable and competent the embodiment of what it seems the Mets are aspiring to be.         Then later as Wilpon the teamåÛåªs chief operating officer met with reporters he was asked whether the team was ready to win next season. His face went blank and his eyes stared off as he considered the question for more than a moment.         åÛåÏI think weåÛåªre still buildingåÛå he said. åÛåÏI mean weåÛåªd like to win next season of course. But I canåÛåªt tell you what other moves Sandy is going to be able to make between now and opening day. WeåÛåªve got a long way to go. This is the second day of the winter meetings.åÛå         It is true that moves can still be made but with the Mets missing the young ace Matt Harvey it may not be realistic to think they will contend before 2015. And even if Harvey were not absent for next season after Tommy John elbow surgery it seemed that the Mets would not spend much more money than they already have. Alderson said this week that the team might have to live with certain weaknesses having reiterated the importance of smart balanced spending.         Alderson could probably use an upgrade at shortstop one or two more starting pitchers and a reliever or two. But his best return might come in a trade for Ike Davis or Daniel Murphy or both. Alderson indicated that he would not spend another $60 million on a free agent this off-season as he did on Granderson.         Instead of perhaps chasing Stephen Drew who could command a contract worth more than $10 million a year Alderson was open to having Ruben Tejada as his everyday shortstop. Alderson and Manager Terry Collins seemed pleased with TejadaåÛåªs progress in a recent four-week fitness and nutrition program that the team set up in Michigan.         Collins seemed fine with having Tejada at shortstop despite his spotty reputation. Collins said he spoke with Tejada after the season looked him in the eye and could tell he was upset with himself and would work harder. After batting .289 in 114 games as the MetsåÛåª primary shortstop in 2012 Tejada played more games in the minors than the majors last season.         åÛåÏI think heåÛåªs bound and determined to show everybody that he is the guyåÛå Collins said.         Wilmer Flores and Lucas Duda were also among the players in the program and were producing good results according to Collins. If Murphy and Davis are traded Flores and Duda might start on the right side of the infield.         Flores (22) Tejada (24) and Duda (27) are all still relatively young and to some extent unproven.         Duda and Tejada intend to return to the fitness program in January. If the Mets do end up counting on them and Flores maybe each will take another step or as Alderson said the Mets may have to live with certain weaknesses.

After aÌâåÊ year of watching I came in one day and he said åÛå÷Sit down and start working.åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå         So what appealed to him about watchmaking?         åÛåÏNothingåÛå Mr. Bracco said. åÛåÏI was making a living.åÛå         At the George Westinghouse Career and Technical High School he took a watchmaking class under a teacher who encouraged the students to excel at whatever trade they took up åÛåÓ åÛåÏfixing watches shining shoes cleaning dishes whatever you were doingåÛå Mr. Bracco said.ÌâåÊ         Out in the world he took over a booth in a jewelry store at 18 Eldridge Street.

Abdul Quader Mollah who was found guilty in February of war crimes committed during the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan was due to be hanged at one minute past midnight (1801 GMT) at Dhaka Central Jail.         But Mollah's lawyers rushed to petition a judge who agreed to delay the execution pending a hearing at 10.30 a.m.         Ending widespread confusion and conflicting reports Additional Attorney General M. K. Rahman finally confirmed the two sides in the case would meet at the Supreme Court.         He said there was no legal provision for the execution to be reviewed because the trial had been held by a special war crimes tribunal and thus under separate law.         Mollah is assistant secretary general of the Jamaat-e-Islami party which is barred from contesting elections but plays a key role in the opposition movement alongside the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).         Critics say Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina whose bitter rivalry with BNP leader Begum Khaleda Zia has dominated politics for more than two decades has used the tribunal to target Jamaat and weaken the opposition.         Human rights groups say the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) procedures fall short of international standards.         Previous rulings by the ICT set up in 2010 to investigate atrocities during the 1971 conflict sparked deadly clashes across the impoverished nation of 160 million people.         Sporadic violence broke out on Tuesday including in the southern district of Feni where one person was killed in clashes between police and Islami Chhatra Shibir the student wing of Jamaat police said.         Jamaat activists also torched vehicles and exploded crude bombs in Dhaka and the port city of Chittagong.         In Dhaka hundreds of people who supported the tribunal angrily chanted for Mollah's execution to be carried out.         ELECTION ROW         The latest bone of contention between Khaleda and Hasina is the election which has been set for January 5.         The BNP wants to postpone the vote until after the formation of a caretaker cabinet that would remove Hasina from power a demand the prime minister has so far resisted.         The announcement of plans for Mollah's execution initially dashed hopes that the two sides could be edging towards a compromise.         Oscar Fernandez-Taranco United Nations assistant secretary general for political affairs has been in Bangladesh for the last four days seeking to break the deadlock.         Bangladesh has been racked by violent protests sparked by the tribunal's rulings disagreements over the election and anger among garment workers over low pay and poor conditions.         Nearly 200 people have been killed and thousands wounded in running street battles between protesters and police across Bangladesh and many roads and railways remain blocked.         The unrest threatens the $22 billion garment export industry the country's economic mainstay which employs some four million people most of them women.         The industry which supplies many Western brands came under scrutiny when a building housing factories collapsed in April killing more than 1130 people.         Bangladesh was part of Pakistan when the Indian subcontinent was partitioned at the end of British rule in 1947; but it broke away from Pakistan in 1971 after a nine-month war.         Some factions in Bangladesh including Jamaat opposed the break with Pakistan but the party denies accusations that its leaders committed murder rape and torture.         About three million people were killed according to official figures and thousands of women were raped.         (Writing by Mike Collett-White; editing by Ralph Boulton)

Or they can cross the street for a $740 bottle of chardonnay at an industrial wine shop accented with modern art.         It is a sign outside that locale Gnarly Vines that catches DasaniåÛåªs notice one spring afternoon: åÛåÏWine Tasting Tonight 5-8.åÛå         Dasani is hardly conversant in the subject of libations but this much she knows: A little drink will take off her motheråÛåªs edge. Without further ado Chanel heads into the wine shop on Myrtle Avenue trailed by four of her eight children. They are lugging two greasy boxes of pizza and a jumbo pack of diapers from Target.         The cashier pauses. The sommelier smiles.         åÛåÏWanna try a little rosÌÄå©?åÛå she asks brightly pouring from a 2012 bottle of Mas de Gourgonnier. åÛåÏI would describe it as definitely fruit forward at the beginning.åÛå         Chanel polishes it.         åÛåÏBut really crisp dry refreshing åÛåÓåÛåÓåÛå         åÛåÏNot refreshingåÛå Chanel says. åÛåÏI just think ... dry.åÛå         åÛåÏNo itåÛåªs very dryåÛå says the sommelier a peppy blonde in wire-rim glasses. åÛåÏItåÛåªs high acid a little citrusy.åÛå         Chanel sticks out her tongue. She finds the womanåÛåªs choice of words unappetizing. To the side of the wine display is a large silver vase that recalls the family urn prompting ChanelåÛåªs son Khaliq to ask if it contains the ashes of a dead person.         åÛåÏOh my gosh for  cremation ?åÛå the sommelier asks shaking her head. åÛåÏWe just use it for spitting in.åÛå         åÛåÏFor  spitting ?åÛå Chanel says with horror.         åÛåÏYeah itåÛåªs got rejected wine in itåÛå the sommelier says.         Chanel scoffs. She might not like the wine but she sees no reason to spit it out. She moves on to a Tuscan sangiovese.         Ignoring the spectacle Dasani scans the room frowning at a sign on the wall: Liqueur. åÛåÏThey got liquor spelled wrongåÛå she yelps victoriously.         Actually the sommelier interjects that is the French word for the delicate liquid spirits derived from fruits such as pomegranates and raspberries. åÛåÏBut youåÛåªre very rightåÛå she offers sweetly. åÛåÏThat is not how you spell liquor.åÛå         åÛåÏNot the hood liquoråÛå Chanel says.         DASANIåÛåªS neighborhood is one of the most unequal pockets of New York City the most unequal metropolis in America.         Fort Greene occupies less than one square mile. On the map its boundaries form the shape of a pitcher tilting at the northwestern edge of Brooklyn.         Just north of Fort Greene Park are the projects and among them the homeless shelter where Dasani lives.         Just south of the park are some of BrooklynåÛåªs finest townhouses and cultural gems including the Brooklyn Academy of Music where theatergoers were lining up to see åÛåÏJulius CaesaråÛå on the day that Dasani led her mother to the wine shop.         If one thing distinguishes DasaniåÛåªs New York from that of her antecedents it is a striking proximity to the wealth that eludes her.         She routinely walks past a boho-chic boutique on Lafayette Avenue where calfskin boots command $845. Heading north she passes French bulldogs on leashes and infants riding like elevated genies in Uppababy strollers with shock-absorbing wheels. Three blocks away is an ice cream parlor where $6 buys two salted-caramel scoops.         Like most children Dasani is oblivious to the precise cost of such extravagances. She only knows that they are beyond her reach.         Nor can this 11-year-old girl be expected to grasp the subtle gradations of Fort GreeneåÛåªs elite whose creative class feels pushed out of a neighborhood it once considered more gritty than tony.         Dasani sees the chasms of Fort Greene more plainly reasoning that wealth belongs to åÛåÏthe whitesåÛå because åÛåÏthey save their money and donåÛåªt spend it on drinking and smoking.åÛå         Such perceptions are fed by the contrasts of this neighborhood where the top 5 percent of residents earn 76 times as much as the bottom quintile. Dasani spots addicts gathering outside a food pantry a block from $2 million brownstones. She notes that few people in the projects use the Citi Bikes stationed nearby. The celebrated bike sharing program unveiled this year requires a credit or debit card for a $101 security deposit.

At cocktail parties one hears familiar litanies about higher taxes on the wealthy to fund prekindergarten education and potentially falling real estate prices. A hedge fund friend tells me that the mayor-electåÛåªs determination to denude Mayor Michael R. BloombergåÛåªs stop-and-frisk strategy makes him shudder. A columnist for The Daily Beast  asks  if Mr. de Blasio is åÛåÏthe new DinkinsåÛå while the usually reasonable Economist  warns  that åÛåÏby choosing Bill de Blasio New Yorkers have taken a risk with their cityåÛåªs prosperity.åÛå         As someone who has spent his adult life raising a family and running a financial business in New York I have some words of wisdom for my anxious friends: Calm down.         Bill de Blasio is no Daniel Ortega (though heåÛåªs gotten grief for having  gone to Nicaragua  in 1988 to give out food during the civil war there). Amending the Police DepartmentåÛåªs stop-and-frisk policy to be less race-based makes sense and will not create anarchy on the streets. In fact the city has already quietly reduced the number of stops by over half and the sky has not fallen. And a modest tax increase in order to pay for pre-K education probably not doable in any case because it requires state approval is not the first step in turning New York City into an urban kibbutz.         Over the past quarter-century like other New Yorkers IåÛåªve enjoyed the pleasures of a safer cleaner and more prosperous city. IåÛåªve been able to hire lots of smart people and build a successful business; my two children were raised free from worry about their personal safety. IåÛåªve also witnessed waves of immigrants breathe new life into derelict neighborhoods and seen the South Bronx literally rise from the ashes. It is a daily thrill to live in New York City. And I too remember what the city was like in the 1970s and 1980s. The graffiti. The crime. The crack vials in the park. The lawlessness. I harbor no nostalgia for that period.         But while I understand that making the city a millionairesåÛåª playground has its benefits åÛåÓ and not just for millionaires åÛåÓ I also find this affluent angst more than a bit overwrought.         There is no denying that living in Mr. BloombergåÛåªs New York has given the comfortable a deep sense of security over the past 12 years. City Hall has been led by åÛåÏone of usåÛå someone who knows what itåÛåªs like to run a business has a vacation home and pays for private schools; someone who lived in the same privileged bubble we did. ItåÛåªs true everyone benefits from a safer New York but the city is particularly wonderful for those who can actually afford its housing attend concerts in Lincoln Center eat in its fancy restaurants and pay for parking to boot. To this fortunate group government exists in large measure to keep the merry-go-round going to maintain public order.         Concern about Mr. de BlasioåÛåªs intention or ability to spoil the party is misplaced for several reasons. It exaggerates his radicalism åÛåÓ thanks in part to his own rhetoric åÛåÓ and underestimates the strength of the cityåÛåªs economic foundation. And it fails to take into account the consensus that has emerged over the past quarter-century about how New York City should be governed.         The conventional wisdom about New York CityåÛåªs recovery goes something like this: Edward I. Koch (1978-1989) restored the cityåÛåªs fiscal footing and boosted its morale but did little to stem the chaos of his era. David N. Dinkins (1990-1993) according to this narrative was a weak leader who stood helpless while gangs roamed the streets freely and sent the city to the precipice at which point Rudolph W. Giuliani (1994-2001) saved the day with a combination of tough talk and innovative policing policies while Mr. Bloomberg (2002-2013) and his brilliant police commissioner Raymond W. Kelly built and improved on that record.         There is a grain of truth to this narrative but it ignores the degree to which Mr. Koch planted the seeds of the cityåÛåªs recovery dismisses meaningful contributions by Mr. Dinkins and overstates Mr. GiulianiåÛåªs impact. In fact Mr. Bloomberg and his three predecessors have been remarkably consistent about how they dealt with the cityåÛåªs two bedrock issues economic development and crime-fighting and there is every indication that Mr. de Blasio fits neatly into the consensus.

Deepika Singh 26 had gashed her knee at a backyard barbecue. Orla Roche a rambunctious toddler on vacation with her family had tumbled from a couch splitting open her forehead on a table.         On a quiet Saturday in May nurses in blue scrubs quickly ushered the two patients into treatment rooms. The wounds were cleaned numbed and mended in under an hour. åÛåÏIt was great åÛåÓ they had good DVDs the staff couldnåÛåªt have been niceråÛå said Emer Duffy OrlaåÛåªs mother.         Then the bills arrived. Ms. SinghåÛåªs three stitches cost $2229.11. OrlaåÛåªs forehead was sealed with a dab of skin glue for $1696. åÛåÏWhen I first saw the charge I said åÛå÷What could possibly have cost that much?åÛåªÌâåÊåÛå recalled Ms. Singh. åÛåÏThey billed for everything every pill.åÛå         In a medical system notorious for opaque finances and inflated bills nothing is more convoluted than hospital pricing economists say. Hospital charges represent about a third of the $2.7 trillion annual United States health care bill the biggest single segment  according to government statistics  and are the largest driver of medical inflation a new study in  The Journal of the American Medical Association  found.         A day spent as an inpatient at an American hospital costs on average more than $4000 five times the charge in many other developed countries according to the  International Federation of Health Plans  a global network of  health insurance  industries. The most expensive hospitals charge more than $12500 a day. And at many of them including California Pacific Medical Center emergency rooms are profit centers. That is why one of the simplest and oldest medical procedures åÛåÓ closing a wound with a needle and thread åÛåÓ typically leads to bills of at least $1500 and often much more.         At Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City Daniel Diaz 29 a public relations executive was billed $3355.96 for five stitches on his finger after cutting himself while peeling an avocado. At a hospital in Jacksonville Fla. Arch Roberts Jr. 56 a former government employee was charged more than $2000 for three stitches after being bitten by a dog. At Mercy Hospital in Port Huron Mich. Chelsea Manning 22 a student received bills for close to $3000 for six stitches after she tripped running up a path. Insurers and patients negotiated lower prices but those charges were a starting point.         The main reason for high hospital costs in the United States economists say is fiscal not medical: Hospitals are the most powerful players in a health care system that has little or no price regulation in the private market.         Rising costs of drugs medical equipment and other services and fees from layers of middlemen play a significant role in escalating hospital bills of course. But just as important is that mergers and consolidation have resulted in a couple of hospital chains åÛåÓ like Partners in Boston or Banner in Phoenix åÛåÓ dominating many parts of the country allowing them to command high prices from insurers and employers.         Sutter Health California Pacific Medical CenteråÛåªs parent company operates more than two dozen community hospitals in Northern California almost all in middle-class or high-income neighborhoods. Its clout has helped California Pacific Medical Center the stateåÛåªs largest private nonprofit hospital also earn the highest net income in California. Prices for many of the procedures at the San Francisco hospital are among the top 20 percent in the country according to a New York Times analysis of data released by the federal government.         åÛåÏSutter is a leader åÛåÓ a pioneer åÛåÓ in figuring out how to amass market power to raise prices and decrease competitionåÛå said Glenn Melnick a professor of health economics at the University of Southern California. åÛåÏHow do hospitals set prices? They set prices to maximize revenue and they raise prices as much as they can åÛåÓ all the research supports that.åÛå         In other countries the price of a day in the hospital often includes many basic services. Not here. The åÛåÏchargemasteråÛå the price list created by each hospital typically has more than ten thousand entries and almost nothing åÛåÓ even an aspirin a bag of IV fluid or a visit from a physical therapist to help a patient get out of bed åÛåÓ is free. Those lists are usually secret but California requires them to be  filed with health regulators and disclosed .         California Pacific Medical CenteråÛåªs 400-page chargemaster for this year contains some eye-popping figures: from $32901 for an  X-ray  study of the heartåÛåªs arteries to $25646.88 for gall bladder removal (doctoråÛåªs fees not included) to $5510 for a simple vaginal delivery (not including $731 for each hour of labor or $137 for each bag of IV fluid). Even basic supplies or services carry huge markups: $20 for a codeine pill (50 cents at Rite-Aid or Walgreens) $543 for a breast-pump kit ($25 online) $4495 for a  CT scan  of the abdomen (about $400 at an outpatient facility nearby). Plenty of other hospitals set similar prices.         Dr. Warren Browner the chief executive officer of California Pacific Medical Center said that there were good reasons that hospitals charged what they did: They must have highly trained professionals available 24 hours a day seven days a week. They must constantly upgrade to the latest equipment and building standards to meet patientsåÛåª expectations and state mandates. They charge paying or well-insured patients more to compensate for others they treat at a loss.         åÛåÏHospital care is extremely expensive to produce and to have available for everyone in the communityåÛå he said noting that hospitals needed to have a neurosurgeon on call in case a patient turned up with a blood clot on the brain. åÛåÏWe take every penny of the revenue we earn and use it to build new and better facilities for everyone in the city.åÛå         Some health economists say that even though most hospitals are nonprofit they nonetheless are often flush with revenue and guilty of unnecessary spending.         åÛåÏHospitals are self-fueling ever-expanding machinesåÛå said James Robinson an economist and professor of health policy at the University of California Berkeley. åÛåÏThere is an infinite amount of stuff to buy åÛåÓ amenities machines new wings higher salaries more nurses.åÛå         åÛåÏButåÛå he asked åÛåÏto deliver good health care what do you need?åÛå          Few Constraints   There is little science to how hospitals determine the prices they print on hospital bills.         åÛåÏChargemaster prices are basically arbitrary not connected to underlying costs or market pricesåÛå said Professor Melnick the economist. Hospitals åÛåÏcan set them at any level they want. There are no market constraints.åÛå         Prices for any item or service are set by each hospital and move up and down yearly and show extraordinary variability health economists say. The codeine that costs $20 and the bag of IV fluid that costs $137 at California Pacific are charged at $1 and $16 at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center across town. But U.C.S.F. Medical Center charges $1600 for an amniocentesis which costs $687 at California Pacific.         After each hospital stay or visit computer programs and human coders and billers use the chargemaster price list to translate the services rendered into a price. Sutter employs more than 1300 people at a special center in Roseville Calif. to perform this and other administrative tasks for its hospitals. Emergency room visits typically include separate charges for doctoråÛåªs services and for supplies as well as a åÛåÏfacility feeåÛå åÛåÓ the charge for walking in the door.         Orla RocheåÛåªs bill for example included $529 for åÛåÏsupplies and devicesåÛå though her mother is perplexed about what those are: Orla left the emergency room with gauze wrapped round her head (under $1 at Internet supply stores) festooned with a pink cartoon sticker. According to the chargemaster price list for California Pacific a vial of skin glue is billed at $181 a tube of  antibiotic  cream at $125.84 and a vial of local anesthetic at $79.73. These items can be purchased for $15.99 $36.99 and $5 on the Internet though hospitals åÛåÓ which buy wholesale and in bulk åÛåÓ pay far less.         The bill also included $1167 for the facility fee which was classified at Level 3 åÛåÓ the middle of the scale though OrlaåÛåªs treatment was one of the most simple emergency room interventions. At Lenox Hill in New York Daniel DiazåÛåªs unusually detailed bill for his stitches included $1828 for emergency room services $628 for repairing the wound $571.83 for åÛåÏapplication of a finger splintåÛå $97.10 for a  tetanus  shot and $311 for someone to give the injection. At Sparrow Hospital in Lansing Mich. 2-year-old Ben BellaråÛåªs bill for six stitches more than $2000 included $145.20 for åÛåÏpharmacyåÛå åÛåÓ a spoonful of ibuprofen and local anesthetic his mother said.         Economists note that hospitals can bill for emergency room care with relative impunity since injured patients generally rush to the nearest treatment facility. But worried about high prices even the sick sometimes shop around. When Jamie Burke 33 a graduate student in North Carolina came to after she was knocked out during a soccer game in April she started searching on her smartphone for an in-network hospital as a friend drove.         åÛåÏIt was crazyåÛå she said åÛåÏbut luckily I wasnåÛåªt unconscious so I could figure it out.åÛå         She is glad she did: Though the hospital billed $5039 her insureråÛåªs in-network contracted rate was about $2700. With copays and coinsurance she owed $600 for the visit.         The uninsured are particularly vulnerable to high prices since they have no one to argue on their behalf. When Arch Roberts Jr. got his bill of more than $2000 for stitches he explained that he was uninsured and his business had failed during the housing crisis so he could not afford the fee. The hospital offered him a åÛåÏcharity care discountåÛå åÛåÓ a price that was still out of range. åÛåÏI donåÛåªt have $800 to pay them any more than I have $2000åÛå for three stitches he said noting that the hospital has been åÛåÏrelentlessåÛå in its collection efforts.          Paths to Profit   Once perennial money pits emergency rooms have become big moneymakers for most hospitals in the last decade experts say as they raised their fees and åÛåÏmanagedåÛå their patient mix. California Pacific Medical Center has nearly doubled its emergency room fees since 2005 its chargemaster price lists show.         California PacificåÛåªs emergency room is not a trauma center; poor or uninsured trauma patients who require lengthy inpatient stays can strain a hospital budget. And insurers allow emergency rooms to bill more than urgent-care centers for simple procedures like stitches or X-raying a sprained ankle making such procedures profitable. Indeed the financial prospects are so appealing that doctorsåÛåª groups in Texas are opening free-standing åÛåÏemergency roomsåÛå that are not connected to hospitals.         åÛåÏHospitals see where theyåÛåªre making money and try to do more of thatåÛå said Dr. David Gifford a former health commissioner of Rhode Island who has studied how labs price their tests. He said that laboratory tests and X-rays are priced high and are profitable though there is no difference in quality from national commercial labs that charge far less. A blood count and blood electrolyte test åÛåÓ ordered every day for most inpatients and often in the emergency room åÛåÓ are priced at $259.06 and $293.25 on California Pacific Medical CenteråÛåªs chargemaster price list. Insurers often pay outside labs less than $10 for the services.         And like any business many hospitals try to do fewer services that are not well paid. In 2012 over loud patient protests California Pacific Medical Center outsourced its kidney  dialysis  unit to  DaVita Health Care Partners  a commercial company citing decreasing reimbursement. More than five years ago after Sutter acquired St. LukeåÛåªs a decrepit hospital in a poor neighborhood it tried to shut the facility and convert it to an outpatient clinic which often generate scans and other expensive tests. (The City of San Francisco rejected the plan.) It did close the hospitalåÛåªs acute psychiatric unit a division that almost always loses money.         åÛåÏYou need a Ph.D. in health economicsåÛå to understand medical pricing said Dr. Browner who has acknowledged that California PacificåÛåªs chargemaster prices might appear high. But he added åÛåÏWe have to recoup what it costs to keep open what it costs to take care of the un- and underinsured and to rebuild.åÛå         He said that MediCal CaliforniaåÛåªs  Medicaid  program pays California Pacific Medical Center only 10 to 20 percent of its actual costs for care.  Medicare  pays about 70 percent he said generally with a predetermined flat fee for each admission based on the patientåÛåªs diagnosis. In contrast many private insurers still pay separately for services rendered based on discounts from the chargemaster prices.         Dr. Browner also pointed to what health care executives call the åÛåÏSaudi sheikh problemåÛå at some hospitals.         åÛåÏYou donåÛåªt really want to change your charges if you have a Saudi sheikh come in with a suitcase full of cash whoåÛåªs going to pay full chargesåÛå he said.         But how much actual charity care does a hospital like California Pacific Medical Center perform? And are insurers and patients paying hospitals for better quality? Or also for amenities like valet parking useless medical gadgetry and inflated salaries?         Though hospitalsåÛåª nonprofit status allows them to reap tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in tax benefits California Pacific Medical CenteråÛåªs main campuses spent 1.27 percent of their more than $1.1 billion in net patient revenues in 2011 on free care for indigent or uninsured patients lower than the state average of 2.07 percent according to  statistics  compiled by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The far smaller St. LukeåÛåªs branch spent 5.32 percent that year.         Sutter based in Sacramento  employs 28 officials who make more than $1 million a year  and four of them are among the top-paid hospital executives in the state. SutteråÛåªs chief executive officer makes more than $5 million. In 2011 Dr. Browner 62 a distinguished physician who spent much of his career in academics made more than $1.2 million according to tax documents.         California Pacific SutteråÛåªs main campus is in upscale Pacific Heights. It has just broken ground on a $2.7 billion renovation which includes a new flagship hospital. Though the project was initiated to meet new state earthquake standards the facility is designed as a sleek glass and marble structure with all private rooms underground parking and roof gardens with flowers and bees åÛåÏto enhance the quality of the healing environmentåÛå according to California Pacific Medical CenteråÛåªs website. Its Facebook page has called it åÛåÏthe coolest hospital in San Francisco possibly the country and even the world.åÛå         Consumers may appreciate åÛåÓ or demand åÛåÓ features that contribute to bigger hospital bills. But studies have found no correlation between prices and patient outcomes. A California state rating of hospital services by  the California Health Care Foundation  gave California Pacific Medical Center average scores in most categories though its surgical-care measures were rated åÛåÏsuperior.åÛå         Its crosstown neighbor University of California San Francisco a nationally ranked academic institution charges far less per day than California Pacific when the greater severity of illnesses of its patients is factored in Professor Melnick said. In factÌâåÊa recent study in the publication Annals of Surgery a monthly review of surgical science found that hospitals with the highest complication rates tended to have higher prices.         From such variations economists conclude that åÛåÏcostsåÛå are highly discretionary noting that hospitals in other developed countries often provide high-quality care with better outcomes in comparatively no-frills environments. Said Dr. Robinson the Berkeley health economist: åÛåÏIf you pay hospitals more they spend it. If you pay them less they adjust. The only way to pay less for health care åÛåÓ is to pay less for health care.åÛå         Hospital officials like to say that their list prices do not reflect what most patients actually pay because private and government insurers negotiate discounts. Simone Singh a professor of health management and policy at the University of Michigan estimated that insurers generally paid 40 to 50 percent of charges. But with powerful chains like Sutter prices are high and the discounts often are not so generous. Patients are left paying more.          A Price åÛå÷SequoiaåÛåª   For her three stitches at California Pacific Medical Center Deepika Singh ended up paying $768.56 åÛåÓ a lot of money for a 26-year-old retail supply chain manager åÛåÓ of the $1813 rate her insurer negotiated for the approximately $2200 bill. Ms. Duffy owed $1366 after her insureråÛåªs discount on 2-year-old OrlaåÛåªs $1700 bill since the family had not met its annual deductible. åÛåÏHow much is that per minute?åÛå she asked.         Across California Sutter hospitals have proved expert at the business of medicine. åÛåÏOur members are very exercised about Sutter åÛåÓ it has increased prices disproportionatelyåÛå said David Lansky chief executive officer of the Pacific Business Group on Health which represents 60 of CaliforniaåÛåªs biggest private employers in its health care negotiations. åÛåÏSutter has been successful at leveraging their huge size in dictating not just price but contract terms.åÛå         Its major competitor is Kaiser a health maintenance organization that runs a closed network of hospitals and doctors. California Pacific Medical Center delivers more than half the babies in San Francisco and is the cityåÛåªs largest employer after Wells Fargo. Sutter contracts also include åÛåÏgag clausesåÛå that prevent employers from knowing what rates have been negotiated by their insurers on their behalf Mr. Lansky said.         Chuck Idelson a spokesman for the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy the research arm of the California Nurses Association said Sutter prices were 40 to 70 percent above its rivalsåÛåª for similar services. When Sutter bought Summit Hospital in Oakland in 1999 rates there went up  29 percent to 72 percent  researchers found. Because of pricing issues proposed insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act did not initially include Sutter hospitals.         Terry Miller 62 a businessman in the Bay Area got a bill for $117000 for a two-night stay at California Pacific Medical Center to place a  stent  to open one of his heartåÛåªs clogged arteries åÛåÓ a charge that did not include fees for the cardiologist and radiologist. According to the Medicare database California Pacific Medical Center charged $43679 for hospitalization to treat a simple  pneumonia  and $96642 to treat a stroke; the Medicare payments for those illnesses were $8046 and $9583.         The high prices have had a ripple effect across Northern California allowing smaller hospitals to charge more as well. åÛåÏSutter is the tallest Sequoia and everyone goes up just underneath them a bitåÛå said Professor Melnick. He noted that hospital prices in California had more than doubled in the past decade after adjustment for inflation.         And payouts in the Pacific region for simple emergency room treatments åÛåÓ stitches a sprained ankle and an  upper respiratory infection  åÛåÓ were by far the highest in the country about 50 percent higher than in the Northeast according to an analysis performed for The Times. by the health care consulting firm Truven Health Analytics.          The Merger Factor   In theory health care consolidation can lead to economies of scale but not if it produces complex supersize systems. Excess administrative costs accounted for about $190 billion of the $2.5 trillion medical bill of the United States in 2009 the Institute of Medicine estimated this year åÛåÓ money that could be used for other purposes.         åÛåÏThere is a big flurry of consolidation and the effects depend on what the objective of the health care system isåÛå said Orry Jacobs of the health care consulting firm BDC Advisors. åÛåÏIf the intent is to improve care and bend cost curves then networks can do so. If the objective is to corner the market and demand higher rates then that will happen.åÛå Indeed research shows that todayåÛåªs hospital mergers tend to drive up prices.         And employers have limited ability to fight back. Sutter operates the only hospital in some California cities. Beginning on Jan. 1 the University of California Berkeley will exclude SutteråÛåªs two nearby hospitals from its plan because it could not reach a price agreement. The universityåÛåªs employees will have to cross the bay or drive inland for in-network hospital treatment or pay more.         As is often the case in American medicine patients will decide if they are willing to pay the high price of care. Back home in New York City Orla DuffyåÛåªs head wound has healed nicely without further treatment. Deepika Singh had her stitches taken out at an urgent care clinic costing $25 with her copay during a business trip to Washington.         Daniel Diaz who had been treated at Lenox Hill Mr. Roberts and Amy Bernstein had no choice but to visit an emergency room this year for stitches. But they all refused to see a doctor for the follow-up.         åÛåÏThe amount was outrageous for the time it took to put them inåÛå said Ms. Bernstein 54 a real estate lawyer from Long Island who cut herself cleaning knives while fixing a kitchen damaged by  Hurricane Sandy . åÛåÏI was so disgusted I took them out myself.åÛå

The project to be called the Kingsbridge National Ice Center caps years of efforts by city officials and community leaders to redevelop a cavernous building that was completed in 1917 and has become an enduring symbol of the BronxåÛåªs struggles. The vote came after city officials brokered a last-minute deal that won over Councilman Fernando Cabrera who represents the area by calling for the developer KNIC Partners to provide an additional $470000 to address traffic and parking issues and to support businesses and local students.         The ice center is scheduled to open in 2017 and will eventually include in its 763000 square feet nine ice rinks a 5000-seat arena dedicated space for community activities and a free after-school program with tutoring and skating lessons. It is expected to create at least 260 permanent jobs and 890 construction jobs in a county with the highest unemployment rate in the state.         åÛåÏThis project is a victory for everyone involved and represents the type of development we can see when everyone works together for the greater goodåÛå said Ruben Diaz Jr. the Bronx borough president.         The ice center also represents a victory for Mayor  Michael R. Bloomberg  as he leaves office. His administration had backed a 2009 plan to transform the armory into a shopping mall which was rejected by the Council amid protests by Bronx officials and residents that it would promote low-paying jobs and compete with local merchants.         åÛåÏWhat is now an abandoned structure will soon become the worldåÛåªs largest indoor ice rink facilityåÛå Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement Tuesday åÛåÏand it will serve as yet another example of our administrationåÛåªs commitment to turning what were once symbols of New York CityåÛåªs decline åÛåÓ McCarren Park Pool High Bridge the High Line and more åÛåÓ into community treasures and international attractions.åÛå         This time the ice center garnered wide support within the Bronx but received mixed signals from Mr. Cabrera whose vote was important to secure the approval of the other council members. At a Council hearing last week Mr. Cabrera said he could not back the project and urged his fellow members to vote against it.         In recent weeks  Mr. CabreraåÛåªs motives have come under scrutiny  after revelations that he had unsuccessfully demanded that the developer KNIC Partners pay $100000 a year for 99 years to a little-known organization Community Action Unlimited which has been associated with Mr. Cabrera a minister and his church New Life Outreach International. Mr. Cabrera has declined to explain his actions or his involvement with the group.         Mr. Cabrera said Tuesday that he decided to vote for the ice center after administration officials reached out the day before to address his remaining concerns about its effects on traffic parking and businesses. åÛåÏIåÛåªve always been for the projectåÛå Mr. Cabrera said. åÛåÏI just wanted to take a good project and make it better.åÛå         Under the plan the ice center will be paid for entirely with $320 million in private money invested by KNIC Partners which was founded by Kevin Parker a former Wall Street executive and includes the former New York Rangers star Mark Messier. KNIC Partners will pay the city $1 a year to lease the armory as well as 5 percent of its annual gross revenue bringing the city an estimated $1 million a year.         KNIC Partners has promised to pay every worker a åÛåÏliving wageåÛå åÛåÓ which amounts to at least $10 an hour with benefits or $11.50 an hour without benefits åÛåÓ and to give hiring preference to Bronx residents as part of a community benefits agreement that it voluntarily negotiated with a coalition of 27 local groups calling themselves the Kingsbridge Armory Redevelopment Alliance. It also plans to set aside $1 million annually to pay for free ice time for underprivileged children local residents and nonprofit organizations.

Scientists have been eager to see if oxytocin which plays a role in emotional bonding trust and many biological processes can improve social behavior in people with autism. Some parents of children with autism have asked doctors to prescribe it although it is not an approved treatment for autism or have purchased lower-dose versions of the drug over the counter.         Scientifically the jury is out and experts say parents should wait until more is known. Some studies suggest that oxytocin sometimes called the åÛåÏlove hormoneåÛå improves the ability to empathize and connect socially and may decrease repetitive behaviors. Others find little or no impact and some research suggests that it can promote clannish and competitive feelings or exacerbate symptoms in people already oversensitive to social cues. Importantly nobody knows if oxytocin is safe or desirable to use regularly or long term.         Now the  first study of how oxytocin affects the brains of children  with autism finds hints of promise åÛåÓ and also suggestions of what its limitations might be.         On the promising side the small study published Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the hormone given as an inhalant generated increased activity in parts of the brain involved in social connection. This suggests not only that oxytocin can stimulate social brain areas but also that in children with autism these brain regions are not irrevocably damaged but are plastic enough to be influenced.         The limitations could include a finding that oxytocin prompted greater brain activity in children with the least severe autism. Some experts said that this could imply that oxytocin may work primarily in less-impaired people but others said it might simply suggest that different doses are needed.         åÛåÏHere we have a really clear demonstration that oxytocin is affecting brain activity in people with autismåÛå said  Dr. Linmarie Sikich  director of the Adolescent and School-Age Psychiatric Intervention Research Program at the University of North Carolina who was not involved in the study. åÛåÏWhat this shows is that the brains of people with autism arenåÛåªt incapable of responding in a more typical social way.åÛå         Nonetheless said Dr. Sikich who will be leading a large federally funded trial of 300 children to evaluate behavioral effects of daily oxytocin for six or 12 months åÛåÏthereåÛåªs still a big gap in knowing how much it will really change overall functioning and how to best use it.åÛå         In the new study conducted by the  Yale Child Study Center  17 children ages 8 to 16 all with mild autism got a spray of oxytocin or a placebo (researchers did not know which and in another session each child received the other substance). The children were placed in a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine an f.M.R.I. and given a well-established test of social-emotional perception: matching emotions to photographs of peopleåÛåªs eyes. They took a similar test involving objects choosing if photos of fragments of vehicles corresponded to cars trucks and so on.         During the åÛåÏeyesåÛå test brain areas involved in social functions like empathy and reward åÛåÓ less active in children with autism åÛåÓ showed more activity after taking oxytocin than after placebo. Also during the åÛåÏvehiclesåÛå tests oxytocin decreased activity in those brain areas more than the placebo a result that especially excited some experts.         åÛåÏIf you can decrease their attention to a shape or object so you can get them to pay attention to a social stimulus thatåÛåªs a big thingåÛå said  Deborah A. Fein  a psychology professor at the University of Connecticut.         With oxytocin the children did not do better on the social-emotional test unlike in some other studies. But experts said that was not surprising given the difficulty of answering challenging questions while staying still in an f.M.R.I.         åÛåÏWhat I would look for is more evidence of looking in the eyes of parents more attention to what parents are saying less tendency to lecture parents on their National Geographic collectionåÛå Dr. Fein said.         The Yale researchers did study oxytocinåÛåªs effect on such social interactions and are analyzing those results for later publication said  Ilanit Gordon  a co-author of the study.         The Yale team suggests that oxytocin may be most useful not as a continuous treatment to enhance general social skills but as a tool to help children benefit more from behavioral therapy or specific social experiences.         Several experts agreed.

Snowden the former National Security Agency contractor now in Moscow.         Instead this menace may come in the form of a seemingly innocuous dome-topped antenna perched atop an electronics-packed building surrounded by a security fence somewhere in the United States.         In recent months the  Central Intelligence Agency  and the Pentagon have been quietly waging a campaign to stop the State Department from allowing Roscosmos the Russian space agency to build about half a dozen of these structures known as monitor stations on United States soil several American officials said.         They fear that these structures could help Russia spy on the United States and improve the precision of Russian weaponry the officials said. These monitor stations the Russians contend would significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of MoscowåÛåªs version of the Global Positioning System the American satellite network that steers guided missiles to their targets and thirsty smartphone users to the nearest Starbucks.         åÛåÏThey donåÛåªt want to be reliant on the American system and believe that their systems like GPS will spawn other industries and applicationsåÛå said a former senior official in the State DepartmentåÛåªs Office of Space and Advanced Technology. åÛåÏThey feel as though they are losing a technological edge to us in an important market. Look at everything GPS has done on things like your phone and the movement of planes and ships.åÛå         The Russian effort is part of a larger global race by several countries åÛåÓ including China and European Union nations åÛåÓ to perfect their own global positioning systems and challenge the dominance of the American GPS.         For the State Department permitting Russia to build the stations would help mend the Obama administrationåÛåªs relationship with the government of President Vladimir V. Putin now at a nadir because of MoscowåÛåªs granting asylum to Mr. Snowden and its backing of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.         But the C.I.A. and other American spy agencies as well as the Pentagon suspect that the monitor stations would give the Russians a foothold on American territory that would sharpen the accuracy of MoscowåÛåªs satellite-steered weapons. The stations they believe could also give the Russians an opening to snoop on the United States within its borders.         The squabble is serious enough that administration officials have delayed a final decision until the Russians provide more information and until the American agencies sort out their differences State Department and White House officials said.         RussiaåÛåªs efforts have also stirred concerns on Capitol Hill where members of the intelligence and armed services committees view MoscowåÛåªs global positioning network åÛåÓ known as Glonass for Global Navigation Satellite System åÛåÓ with deep suspicion and are demanding answers from the administration.         åÛåÏI would like to understand why the United States would be interested in enabling a GPS competitor like Russian Glonass when the worldåÛåªs reliance on GPS is a clear advantage to the United States on multiple levelsåÛå said Representative Mike D. Rogers Republican of Alabama the chairman of a House Armed Services subcommittee.         Mr. Rogers last week asked the Pentagon to provide an assessment of the proposalåÛåªs impact on national security. The request was made in a letter sent to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel Secretary of State John Kerry and the director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr.         The monitor stations have been a high priority of Mr. Putin for several years as a means to improve Glonass not only to benefit the Russian military and civilian sectors but also to compete globally with GPS.         Earlier this year Russia positioned a station in Brazil and agreements with Spain Indonesia and Australia are expected soon according to Russian news reports. The United States has stations around the world but none in Russia.

But it offers an opportunity for a much bigger breakthrough: rapprochement and eventually even strategic cooperation with Iran.         International alliances morph and shift; relationships freeze and unfreeze. For the last 30 years American-Iranian relations have been stuck in a cycle of suspicion and mistrust to the detriment of both countries. ÌâåÊ         America must now begin to think about a gradual realignment of its Middle East policy one that aims to reintegrate Iran into the international fold and over time transform an enemy into an ally.         It wonåÛåªt be easy. But in the long term it would be good for the United States Israel and the Iranian people.         There are many benefits. Iran which sits between the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf can check Chinese access to critical energy sources while acting as a buffer against an ever-truculent Russia. It also affects events in Lebanon through its ties with Hezbollah and in Israel and the Palestinian territories through its ties with Hamas. And there wonåÛåªt be a solution to SyriaåÛåªs civil war without it.         Iran currently opposes the United States in all those conflicts åÛåÓ largely because of historical enmity with Washington rather than ideological hostility alone. It uses Hezbollah to further its regional interests and rails against Israel to garner popular Arab support not from a genuine commitment to the cause. And while its support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria is more sincere IranåÛåªs past behavior suggests it might be willing to compromise.         In 2003 fearing American military action Iran reached out via the Swiss to American officials. It offered to put everything åÛåÓ including its support for Hamas and Hezbollah åÛåÓ  up for discussion . Controversy surrounds the offer which Washington eventually turned down. But it showed Iran was willing to use its support for militants as a bargaining chip.         And the United States and Iran have several overlapping interests. Bound by mutual antipathy toward the Taliban the two countries cooperated in the 2001 war in Afghanistan. Today both oppose Al Qaeda; Iran can help with intelligence and regional knowledge in that fight.         Iran would clearly benefit from warmer relations. From its 1980-88 war with Iraq to todayåÛåªs sanctions it has suffered. The country needs investment in its oil and financial sectors and foreign expertise to develop its economy but those are impossible without fixing its relationship with the United States.         ItåÛåªs easy to forget that the two nations were once allies. In the 1970s Iran and Saudi Arabia formed Richard M. NixonåÛåªs åÛåÏtwin pillaråÛå strategy to counter Soviet influence in the region. Part of AmericaåÛåªs unpopularity in Iran comes from its support of the hated shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi before he was overthrown in the 1979 revolution. But a realignment today based on a new convergence of interests would be a very different proposition.         Becoming a partner of sorts with a member of åÛåÏthe axis of evilåÛå would be extraordinarily hard for America. For a start the Saudis would be horrified.         But Saudi ArabiaåÛåªs opposition doesnåÛåªt really matter as much these days. The United States built its ties with the Saudis on a need for oil that no longer exists to the same degree; the relationship is artificial and anachronistic.         New fracking technologies have made America the biggest producer of hydrocarbons and non-OPEC exports in the world while Canadian South America and African sources are becoming increasingly plentiful. The Saudis still influence oil markets but they can no longer shock the global economy as they did with the 1973 oil embargo. Unlike Iran Saudi Arabia has little to offer besides oil; it doesnåÛåªt have a democratic tradition and its financing of Wahhabi Islam has seriously damaged American interests across the world.         Israel like Saudi Arabia fiercely objects to the nuclear deal. But thatåÛåªs shortsighted. DÌÄå©tente between Iran and America could be good for Israel in the long run. Both the Jewish state and the Persian Shiite state are outsiders in a predominantly Sunni Arab Middle East. They were allies before 1979. And though Iran supports Hezbollah and Hamas its army has never taken part in the many Arab wars against Israel.         Even after the overthrow of the shah and the subsequent hostage crisis Israel lobbied hard for the new Islamic Republic in Washington. Seeking to retain IranåÛåªs friendship amid a sea of hostile Arab states Israel even helped Iran in its war against Iraq.         No matter how many peace treaties are signed with Arab leaders only Iran has proved it can work with Israel. Moreover Iran cannot be contained forever; it is far better for the two countries to come to terms based on shared interests.         Iran is still a human rights violator and a sponsor of terrorism. But 30 years of sanctions and silence havenåÛåªt tempered its behavior. Conversely engagement strengthens IranåÛåªs moderates. One of Hassan RouhaniåÛåªs first acts as president was to release political prisoners. He has hinted that more concessions could follow if relations improve.         The Iranian people are the WeståÛåªs biggest asset. During the Cold War communist governments remained hostile to the West but their citizensåÛåª yearning for Western freedoms contributed to the downfall of those regimes.         Iranians yearn too. The country has a strong tradition of constitutionalism stretching back more than 100 years and its citizens are sympathetic to American-style democracy and know their lives would be vastly improved through dÌÄå©tente with the West. ThatåÛåªs why they voted in large numbers for Mr. Rouhani earlier this year and for the reformer Mir Hossein Mousavi four years ago.         DÌÄå©tente wonåÛåªt happen overnight. Much of IranåÛåªs clerical establishment is instinctively anti-American and the American right remains hostile toward any rapprochement with Iran.         But both Mr. Obama and Mr. Rouhani have proved they can go beyond their respective hard-liners to make a deal. The 21st-century Middle East is a new and dangerous place. To lead the region into a better future Washington must adapt and leave old enmities behind.

Most of the teamåÛåªs offensive needs have been addressed but there are still positional holes to fill. The Yankees may add a second baseman or third baseman a starting pitcher and a couple of relievers but according to a person in baseball who has spoken to Cashman the first order of business at the Swan and Dolphin hotel this week is to see what trade possibilities exist.         The Yankees could return to free agency if they do not find something appealing in trade talks with other teams.         With the signings of Jacoby Ellsbury and Carlos Beltran the Yankees have a glut of outfielders. The most tradable is Brett Gardner and several teams have called the Yankees asking if he is available. The Yankees like Gardner and could keep him to form a speedy lineup combination alongside Ellsbury. Originally the Yankees were leaning in that direction. But once they signed Beltran the situation changed somewhat and with so many teams showing interest the Yankees would be remiss not to entertain talks.         In the lobbies and hallways of the hotel here the names of pitchers like Jeff Samardzija of the Chicago Cubs and Chris Sale of the White Sox are on the lips of many executives scouts and agents. Several wondered about the likelihood of a trade involving Sale and noted that Samardzija who is arbitration eligible would have higher trade value because he is relatively affordable (at a salary of $2.64 million last season).         Gardner will be a free agent after the 2014 season and that makes him less desirable to any team looking to retain an inexpensive player for several years. He could be used to acquire a second baseman.         If nothing materializes via trade the Yankees could continue their pursuit of the free-agent infielder Omar Infante. But the Yankees were hearing that Infante 31 was asking for a four-year deal and they are not inclined to do that. They also have shown interest in Mark Reynolds who demonstrated his versatility for the Yankees last season at both third base and first base.         The Yankees acted swiftly after they lost Robinson Cano to the Seattle Mariners signing Beltran the same day. They signed Ellsbury earlier in the week after sensing that Cano would leave. Ellsbury agreed to a seven-year $153 million contract to play center field for the Yankees and left the Boston Red Sox searching for a new leadoff hitter.         åÛåÏHe played with a broken foot he played with a beat-up left thumbåÛå Red Sox Manager John Farrell said åÛåÏand I think he proved to a lot of people including himself that heåÛåªs very capable and certainly a dynamic player.åÛå         Farrell added: åÛåÏWeåÛåªre going to miss Jacoby. HeåÛåªs a very good player.åÛå         The Yankees lost an exceptional player in Cano but Jarrod Saltalamacchia the catcher who left the Red Sox to sign with the Miami Marlins said the Yankees could be in better shape as they have been reconstituted.         åÛåÏHe was the guy you said åÛå÷WeåÛåªre not going to let him beat usåÛåªÌâåÊåÛå Saltalamacchia said of Cano. åÛåÏHeåÛåªs a great player and you canåÛåªt really just throw him soft stuff because he can handle that. But they got Ellsbury and Brian McCann and Beltran and itåÛåªs better to have three or four of those guys than just one.åÛå         The Yankee also re-signed Hiroki Kuroda but they still need another starter. They have shown little if any interest so far in the big-name free-agent pitchers on the market. But they are still closely monitoring the situation with Masahiro Tanaka the Japanese ace.         According to a person who has been involved with the discussions over the new posting system for Japanese players an agreement is expected to be reached within days perhaps allowing Tanaka the hard-throwing right-hander to be posted. But the Rakuten Eagles TanakaåÛåªs team are disappointed that the new system includes a maximum posting bid of $20 million which guarantees only the right to negotiate with the player. Because of their dismay the Eagles have hinted that they might not post Tanaka.         Yozo Tachibana the president of the Eagles was expected to arrive at the meetings Tuesday to discuss the matter. If Tanaka is posted the Yankees are expected to submit a maximum bid and then try to sign him to a contract. But many teams are expected to make maximum bids and Tanaka will be allowed to negotiate with all of them.

That the defendants were Russian was perhaps not altogether unusual given  the number of recent prosecutions  for similar insurance schemes perpetrated in New York by immigrants from the former Soviet Union.         But these were no ordinary Russians. They were diplomats posted to New York City and their wives accused of fraudulently applying for Medicaid benefits over the past nine years. Prosecutors characterized the scheme as an audacious swindle of the federal health benefits program for the needy orchestrated by officials in the Russian Consulate in New York and its mission to the United Nations.         åÛåÏDiplomacy should be about extending hands not picking pockets in the host countryåÛå said Preet Bharara the United States attorney in Manhattan whose office announced on Thursday that it had charged 49 past or present Russian diplomats and their spouses in the $1.5 million Medicaid fraud case.         åÛåÏThe charges expose shameful and systemic corruption among Russian diplomats in New YorkåÛå Mr. Bharara said.         A criminal complaint unsealed in Federal District Court said that in addition to the defendants 11 of whom still live in the United States dozens of other conspirators not named had received illegally obtained benefits.         Mr. BhararaåÛåªs news briefing unlike others in the past was not followed by an appearance of the defendants in court. Mr. Bharara said his office had been advised that the defendants all had diplomatic immunity so none had been arrested.         He said the State Department could seek a waiver of immunity from the Russian government to allow a prosecution to go forward. If no waiver was given Mr. Bharara said the State DepartmentåÛåªs policy was to åÛåÏrequire departure of that individual from the United States.åÛå         In Moscow the Foreign Ministry declined a request for comment but the deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told news organizations that he was surprised by the charges. He did not address their substance but complained that the criminal complaint had been made public without private notifications through diplomatic channels.         åÛåÏWe have many claims against American diplomats in MoscowåÛå Mr. Ryabkov said in remarks reported by the official RIA Novosti news agency åÛåÏbut we donåÛåªt air them out in public. There are dozens of situations where we can make a complaint against them.åÛå         In Washington a State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said at a briefing that American officials were reviewing the charges but were not yet in a position to speak about what might happen.         As for the case itself she added: åÛåÏWe donåÛåªt think this should affect our bilateral relationship with Russia. Quite frankly there are too many important issues we have to work on together.åÛå         Of the 63 babies born to Russian diplomats and their spouses in New York City between 2004 and 2013 58 births åÛåÓ 92 percent åÛåÓ were in families that received Medicaid benefits the complaint says.         The complaint says an 18-month investigation of the 49 defendantsåÛåª applications revealed åÛåÏgeneral patterns of misrepresentations which allowed them to qualify for Medicaid.åÛå         For example the defendants frequently underreported their household income at an amount below the applicable Medicaid eligibility level the complaint charges. Each diplomat listed in the complaint said George Venizelos head of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had åÛåÏsubmitted an employer verification form from the Russian government misstating their income in an effort to qualify for benefits.åÛå         The complaint cites one couple Mikhail Kuleshov a second secretary at the United Nations mission and his wife Anna Kuleshova who had a baby in the United States. They falsely reported in their Medicaid application that no one in the household had any income yet Mr. Kuleshov last year received about $60000 from the Russian government the complaint says.         The couple who live in the Bronx in housing paid for by the Russian government received almost $21000 in Medicaid benefits that they were not entitled to according to the complaint.         While many of the diplomats and spouses were cheating the Medicaid program the complaint says they also were spending tens of thousands of dollars on luxury goods and vacations including jewelry watches clothes and shoes at Jimmy Choo Tiffany & Company and BloomingdaleåÛåªs.         The defendants currently work or formerly worked in New York at places like the Russian Mission to the United Nations and the Russian Consulate. Some had diplomatic titles like first secretary second secretary attachÌÄå© and counselor.         A spokesman for the mission on East 67th Street said the case was åÛåÏunder examinationåÛå and declined further comment.         For years insurance fraud schemes in New York and elsewhere have often been dominated by immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Brighton Beach Brooklyn the center of New York CityåÛåªs Russian-speaking immigrant population has one of the highest rates of health care fraud in the nation according to recent federal statistics.         Mr. Bharara said that the investigation was continuing and that any other country with diplomats engaging in such fraud should be on notice that åÛåÏit will be exposed and the conduct will be charged criminally.åÛå

The mismanagement of the website HealthCare.gov and the  cancellation of millions  of policies pushes an underlying question out into the open: Is the federal government capable of managing the provision of a fundamental service through an extraordinarily complex system?         This system requires coordination of over 288 policy options (an average of eight insurers are  competing for business  in 36 states) each with three or more levels of coverage while simultaneously calculating beneficiary income tax credit eligibility subsidy levels deductibles not to mention protecting applicant privacy insuring web security and managing a host of other data points.         A malfunction at any one of these junctures could prove fatal.         In enacting the Affordable Care Act President Obama and his Democratic supporters in Congress took on the task of creating a set of information technologies that has to interconnect with the I.R.S.; the Departments of Labor Treasury Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security; the Social Security administration; state governments; insurers; employers; hospitals; and  practitioners in the private sector .         Robert Charette president of the ITABHI Corporation åÛåÓ a tech firm specializing in risk management åÛåÓ  describes the problems :         åÛåÏHealthCare.gov is a huge system of systems and itåÛåªs extremely difficult to manage these things even in the best of times. ThatåÛåªs mostly because you have so many different interfaces with so many different assumptions controlling how the individual systems operate. And theyåÛåªre rarely built with enough flexibility to be used by lots of other systems. If you take a look at the IRS systems the Department of Homeland Security systems or any of the other ones weåÛåªre talking about they were never created to be connected to something like HealthCare.gov.åÛå The  seven million people  officials initially estimated would sign up for the Obamacare insurance exchanges this year are putting their well-being and that of their families in the hands of government bureaucracies armed with demonstrably inadequate technological expertise.ÌâåÊ         The chaos surrounding efforts to activate HealthCare.gov reinforces a key conservative meme: that whatever the test is government will fail it. Insofar as voters experience their interaction with government as frustrating and unreliable the brunt of political damage will hit Democrats both as the party of government and as the party of Obamacare.ÌâåÊ         Cumulatively recent developments surrounding the rollout of Obamacare strengthen the most damaging conservative portrayals of liberalism and of big government åÛåÒ that on one hand government is too much a part of our lives too invasive too big too scary too regulatory too in your face and on the other hand it is incompetent bureaucratic and expropriatory.         In addition the Affordable Care Act can be construed as  a transfer of benefits from Medicare  which serves an overwhelmingly white population of the elderly åÛåÒ 77 percent of recipients are white åÛåÓ to Obamacare which will  serve a population  that is 54.7 percent minority.ÌâåÊ Over 10 years  according to the Congressional Budget Office  the Affordable Care Act cuts $455 billion from the Medicare budget in order to help pay for Obamacare.         Those who think that a critical mass of white voters has moved past its resistance to programs shifting tax dollars and other resources from the middle class to poorer minorities merely need to look at the election of 2010 which demonstrated how readily this resistance can be used politically. The passage of the A.C.A. that year forced such issues to the fore and  Republicans swept  the House and state houses across the country. The programåÛåªs current difficulties have the clear potential to replay events of 2010 in 2014 and possibly 2016.         The dysfunctional A.C.A. portal is not the only liability for Obamacare.ÌâåÊ         In some states insurance companies operating through new health care state exchanges are excluding key hospitals from coverage. In New Hampshire for example as Jonathan Weisman of The Times  reported  there is one provider Anthem Blue Cross and it has excluded 10 of the stateåÛåªs 26 hospitals from participation in the companyåÛåªs coverage.         Responding to an email Drew Altman the president and C.E.O. of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation wrote of the A.C.A.:         åÛåÏI think the bottom line here is that the åÛå÷winnersåÛåª greatly outnumber the åÛå÷losersåÛåª in general and in the individual market in Obamacare but the media and political math is different from the actual math. A significant minority of åÛå÷losersåÛåª or self-perceived losers and a few high profile bad outcomes (possibly NH) are more than enough to cause real political problems.åÛåÌâåÊ According to Robert J. Blendon a professor at HarvardåÛåªs School of Public Health the New Hampshire type of problem is more endemic:         åÛåÏThis is the next big political story. The president promised people they could keep their doctor and implicitly their hospital. A number of state exchanges are like New Hampshire in that they are offering what are called narrow network plans. Some of these plans exclude coverage at childrenåÛåªs hospitals as well which means some parents with sick children will have to change their source of care. This too is not what was promised.åÛå In the state of Washington the Seattle ChildrenåÛåªs Hospital was  initially left off  the list of approved care providers by five of the seven insurers operating in Kings County through the state exchange Healthplanfinder. The hospital was forced to sue state officials in order to gain eligibility.         Obama and his party's elected officials not only have the elections of 2014 and 2016 to worry about but also the future prospects of the liberal agenda writ large which had appeared to be slowly gaining momentum before the Obamacare portal snafu.

The FTSE 100 turned lower in late trade as U.S. stocks retreated from recent highs showing investors' reluctance to put money back into the market until there is greater clarity on the Federal Reserve's equity-friendly asset-purchase programme.         Several Fed members have backed the scaling-back of the scheme which has helped the FTSE rise 16 percent since it was announced in September 2012 as soon as next week's meeting.         St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard who is sometimes seen as a bellwether for U.S. monetary policy unexpectedly voiced support on Monday for a ""small taper"". Two of his colleagues meanwhile said the risks of continued super-easy monetary policy exceed the benefits.         The FTSE 100 closed 36.17 points lower or 0.6 percent at 6523.31 after hitting an intra-day high of 6571.91 and a low of 6519.00.         Volume on the index was 15 percent lower than its average for the past three months exacerbating share price moves.         The index was supported by a cluster of trendlines and Fibonacci retracements just below a nearly two-month low of 6479 points hit last week.         ""We're seeing some very choppy trading and that shows people are not in the market right now"" said Joshua Raymond a strategist at City Index.         ""My honest sense is people are still wanting to buy back into this market but ... they need to see greater confidence that tapering is not going to happen until the end of the first quarter.""         Tui Travel was among the top FTSE fallers despite reporting strong results as investors took profit on a nearly 11 percent rally in the share since late November.         The stock reversed early gains to close 1.5 percent lower at 376.9 pence.         ""People bought into it in the opening auction but as soon as it got to 396-397 pence we had sell orders from people looking to lock in their profits"" said City Index's Raymond adding he expected the stock to head back up towards its all-time high at around 400 pence.         A rally in insurer Prudential up 1.7 percent at 1283 pence helped the FTSE limit losses after the British-based life group set new growth objectives driven by its Asian business.         ""The market is fairly confident with (chief executive) Tidjane Thiam achieving future targets as well as generating a decent amount of cash from his operations"" Manoj Ladwa head of trading at TJM Partners said.         ""The underlying fundamentals seem to be in place for a sustained upward move"" he added expecting the shares to hit 1500 pence over the next 12 months.         Speculation about a takeover approach boosted valve-maker Weir Group which closed 2.9 percent higher.         (Additional reporting by Toni Vorobyova; Editing by Catherine Evans)        "

Over the last decade my home has turned into an electrical outlet battle zone with family members bouncing one another off the power grid so they can charge their Kindles iPhones Android phones laptops iPods iPads Bluetooth headsets and a flip phone or three.         Some ingenious 14-year-old will soon make a fortune designing a tabletop nuclear reactor with a USB port or maybe a powerstrip the size of a Cadillac Escalade.         Until then I will put a fat checkmark next to tech items that let me move one step closer to single-outlet nirvana. Actually the first such device just hit my hands and if my eyes did not deceive me this baby did not come from the Company That Invents Products You DidnåÛåªt Know You Needed otherwise known as Apple.         Instead it came from Microsoft. The device is the Surface 2 ($450 for the 32-gigabyte version) a tablet/laptop hybrid that unlike its predecessor and competitors may put a dent in the demand for powerstrips in my house.         The Microsoft tortoise has been playing a slow-and-steady strategy on mobile largely because it was about 1000 years late to the starting gate. But MicrosoftåÛåªs continued dominance with Windows and Office gave it time to develop a mobile strategy while maintaining a prominent place on desktops. ThatåÛåªs the glass-half-full argument at least.         While everyone was watching AppleåÛåªs can-you-top-this show and AndroidåÛåªs flood-the-zone operation Microsoft was grinding out mobile software that eventually reached Downright Lovely status.         Why didnåÛåªt anyone notice? Oh. Right. Microsoft hadnåÛåªt quite figured out apps or hardware.         Apps remain an open question but good Microsoft mobile hardware finally arrived this year with the release in October 2012 of the Surface and last February of the Surface Pro. These are tablets that can double as laptops because of a beautifully designed kickstand and a detachable keyboard (the Type Cover $130). Put another way these were entertainment machines that could double as workhorses. The Surface runs the companyåÛåªs basic level software for desktops laptops and other devices Windows RT (version 8.1) while the Surface Pro runs Windows Pro (version 8.1).         The upsides were significant. Here at last were Windows machines that let users experience the companyåÛåªs mobile and desktop software in one device with a nifty interface and most notably the Type Cover which enabled a seamless transition between tablet and laptop. (The Type CoveråÛåªs less versatile sibling the Touch Cover sells for $80.)         The downsides sadly were also significant. Among them: a rigidly designed stand a battery with a short life åÛåÓ someone get me the powerstrip! åÛåÓ and on the base Surface version the omission of Outlook the popular email and scheduling program.         But the second version of the Surface which went on sale in late October most of those downers have been addressed. The new Surface includes Outlook an upgraded battery a kickstand with two viewing angles instead of just one and faster USB ports and other goodies.         It has roughly the same thickness and weight as the iPad åÛåÓ it weighs 1.5 pounds without the cover åÛåÓ and the overall screen size is 10.6 inches giving it slightly more viewing space. With a Type Cover it feels similar in your hands to an iPad with a cover. In all the device falls nicely below the åÛåÏbulkyåÛå threshold.         The company says the battery lasts up to 10 hours two hours more than the previous version. I tested it by streaming video with the screen at full brightness and had power for 8.5 hours.         Why buy the Surface 2 instead of the Surface Pro 2? The Surface Pro 2 is a $900 machine not including the $130 keyboard and at that price the detachable tablet would have to provide a great all-around experience to justify the cost. While the Pro has an excellent high-definition screen (1080p) and a feather-light feel you can get better apps åÛåÓ and many more of them designed for a mobile experience åÛåÓ on Apple and Android devices.

Speaking to Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu Putin praised the military's work in the Arctic where Canada said on Monday it was claiming the North Pole as part of an broader claim on the region.         The United States Denmark and Norway are also pressing for control of what they consider their fair share of massive untapped  oil  and  natural gas  reserves.         ""I request that you pay special attention to the deployment of infrastructure and military units in the Arctic"" Putin said speaking at a Defense Ministry board meeting.         ""By the end of the year it is planned - and I expect it will be done ... the renewal of the Tiksi airfield and completion of construction work on the Severomorsk-1 airfield"" he said in televised comments.         Russia has already completed work on renovating an airfield on the Novosibirsk Islands Putin said which was abandoned in 1993. Earlier this year Moscow sent 10 warships and four icebreakers to the islands in a show of force.         Underscoring Moscow's sensitivity over Arctic claims Russia arrested 30 people on board a Greenpeace ship during a September protest against Russian offshore Arctic drilling. They now face charges carrying seven year jail sentences.         Putin said earlier this week that Russia's military presence in the Arctic was needed to protect against potential threats from the United States.         The U.S. Geological Survey says the Arctic contains 30 percent of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 15 percent of oil.         The world's largest oil producer Russia expects to see oil output decline at its mainstay western Siberian oilfields in coming years and has looked further afield to potential Arctic reserves.

The changes were announced in a party decision that also laid out broad and potentially far-reaching proposals to restructure the economy by encouraging greater private participation in finance vowing market competition in several important parts of the economy and promising farmers better property protection and compensation for confiscated land.         Senior party officials led by President Xi Jinping endorsed the 60 initiatives at a four-day Central Committee conference that ended Tuesday but details were released Friday. Mr. Xi described the document as a bold call for economic renewal social improvement and patriotic nation-building åÛåÓ all under the firm control of one-party rule.         åÛåÏWe must certainly have the courage and conviction to renew ourselvesåÛå he said in a statement accompanying the decision. Both were issued by the official news agency Xinhua.         Mr. Xi who  assumed ChinaåÛåªs top party leadership post  a year ago and  the presidency  eight months ago has tried to project an image as a leader who can pursue a potentially conflicting agenda: making ChinaåÛåªs economy more responsive to market forces and giving its people greater social and economic freedom while fortifying traditional one-party rule.         For months analysts have speculated about the economic policies that could be introduced at the meeting. But the planned changes to population policy and punishment two areas where overhauls have been debated and delayed for years gave the decision significance beyond the economy. They could stir public expectations of even bolder changes under Mr. Xi and Prime Minister Li Keqiang in the decade they are likely to spend in office.         åÛåÏXi Jinping may have the most concentrated power of any Chinese leader since Deng XiaopingåÛå said Xiao Gongqin a professor of history in Shanghai who closely follows Chinese politics and advocates åÛåÏneo-authoritarianåÛå rule to protect the march of market overhauls. åÛåÏPolitically he has pursued an ideological tightening because he wants to prevent the kind of explosion in political demands that could come in a relaxed environment. ThatåÛåªs the biggest danger for any government entering a period of reform.åÛå         For decades most urban couples have been restricted to having one child. That has been changing fitfully with rules on the books that couples can have two children if both parents are single children. But that policy will now be further relaxed nationwide. Many rural couples already have two children and some have more.         åÛåÏThis is the first time that a central document has clearly proposed allowing two children when a husband or wife is an only childåÛå said Wang Guangzhou a demographer at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. åÛåÏNow itåÛåªs just talking about launching this but the specific policies have to be developed at the operational level.åÛå         If carried through the relaxation would be the first significant nationwide easing of family size restrictions that have been in place since the 1970s said Wang Feng a demographer who teaches at both the University of California Irvine and Fudan University in Shanghai. He estimated the policy could lead to one million to two million more births in China every year on top of the approximately 15 million births a year now.         åÛåÏThis step is really I think the middle step toward allowing all couples to have two children and eventually taking away the stateåÛåªs handåÛå Professor Wang said. åÛåÏBut this shift is historical. ItåÛåªs fundamental. To change the mentality of the society of policy makers has taken people more than a decade.åÛå         The one-child restrictions were introduced to deal with official fears that ChinaåÛåªs population would devour too many resources and suffocate growth. But they have created public ire and international criticism over forced abortions and have created a population of 1.34 billion according to a 2010 census that is aging relatively rapidly even before China establishes a firm foothold in prosperity. Experts have for years urged some relaxation of the controls.

Those allegations and others were contained in previously redacted portions of the 474-page police document an affidavit that was used to obtain search warrants. Interviews and wiretaps the Toronto police wrote suggested that Mr. Ford regularly used drugs possibly including heroin and that dealers discussed blackmailing him. Last month Mr. Ford characterized his use of crack cocaine in a now-infamous video as an aberration brought on by åÛåÏone of my drunken stupors.åÛå         åÛåÏRob Ford wants some drugsåÛå the police said they overheard one gang member tell another on a wiretap. åÛåÏThe mayor of the city Rob Ford was smoking his rocks todayåÛå another said apparently referring to crack cocaine. Another gang member boasted on a wiretap that he had åÛåÏso much pictures of Rob Ford doing the hezzaåÛå a slang term for heroin.         It appeared from the document that the mayor in March tried to buy the video of him using crack from the gang members for $5000 plus an automobile. Wiretaps however show that they wanted up to $150000.         On May 17 The Toronto Star and the website Gawker reported that they had seen the video.         The Toronto City Council has stripped Mr. Ford of most of his power and most of his budget and staff. Under provincial law it cannot remove him from office. But the release of the additional police information on Wednesday afternoon renewed calls for Mr. Ford to step down entirely.         Mr. Ford ignored reportersåÛåª questions when he left his office smiling on Wednesday evening.

That would be No. 3 as in Babe Ruth. Granderson chose it because he wanted a single-digit number for his trim frame åÛåÓ åÛåÏIåÛåªm a little guyåÛå he said åÛåÓ and because he was born in March the third month.         åÛåÏHe brings a tremendous amount of professionalism; he brings a personality; he brings credibility; he brings experience; and he brings talentåÛå Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson said. åÛåÏI think all of those things will be important.åÛå         The Wilpons are spending again committing $60 million åÛåÓ five times their richest free-agent contract in the last three off-seasons åÛåÓ to Granderson for the next four years. Granderson delivers the attributes Alderson listed but his number also evokes the tries a hitter gets before striking out. And Granderson does an awful lot of that.         In his last full season with the Yankees 2012 Granderson set a club record for strikeouts with 195. He broke his own record set the previous year with 169. The Mets last season fanned 1384 times tied for the most in the National League and 134 more times than they had ever struck out before.         This is the story of the modern game: a parade of power arms with wipeout breaking stuff overpowering the hitters. With power bats becoming harder to find teams will tolerate strikeouts to get them. Granderson is not even the only new Mets outfielder in this mold: Chris Young (one year $7.25 million) is another free swinger.         åÛåÏWhat we look at is overall performance which would include home run rates walk rates a variety of different things that go beyond just how many strikeoutsåÛå Alderson said. åÛåÏWe donåÛåªt promote the idea of strikeouts but at the same time you sometimes need to take the bad with the good.åÛå         The Boston Red Sox set a franchise record for strikeouts last season and often looked futile in October. Mike Napoli struck out in more than half his plate appearances in the American League Championship Series but also homered twice both in one-run victories.         The Red Sox went on to win the World Series of course and Granderson cheerfully noted that the Mets were already in better shape than Boston was a year ago. The Red Sox vaulted from last place to a title and the Mets Granderson pointed out finished in third place in the N.L. East.         åÛåÏAny team has an opportunity to go out there and winåÛå Granderson said. åÛåÏAnd this organization as a whole with the pieces they have such as David Wright and the rest of the cast out there we have everything in place to go out there and do some amazing things.åÛå         His use of the word amazing was probably intentional. After four years in the Bronx Granderson has shifted fully to a Flushing State of Mind. For $60 million why wouldnåÛåªt he?         åÛåÏA lot of the people IåÛåªve met in New York have always said true New Yorkers are Mets fansåÛå Granderson said. åÛåÏSo IåÛåªm excited to get a chance to see them all out there.åÛå         Granderson must not have interacted much with the fans at Yankee Stadium who watched him help the Yankees to the playoffs in each of his first three seasons. He bashed 84 homers from 2011 to 2012 including 37 away from the YankeesåÛåª cozy dimensions.         The Mets are betting that his power will translate to Citi Field but at least they have wagered only money. The  Arizona Diamondbacks  sacrificed a top young starter Tyler Skaggs and a speedy outfielder Adam Eaton to get their own power hitter Tuesday.         The Diamondbacks acquired Mark Trumbo åÛåÓ the AngelsåÛåª home run leader in each of the last three seasons åÛåÓ and two players to be named while sending Skaggs to Anaheim and Eaton to the Chicago White Sox. The White Sox also sent starter Hector Santiago to the Angels.         Kevin Towers the DiamondbacksåÛåª general manager had tried to rid his team of hitters prone to strikeouts. Over three off-seasons he shed Young Adam LaRoche Mark Reynolds Kelly Johnson (a new Yankee) and Justin Upton. The teamåÛåªs strikeouts fell but home run production all but disappeared.         Last season the Diamondbacks hit only 130 home runs the fewest in franchise history despite the presence of Paul Goldschmidt who tied for the league lead with 36. Only two Diamondbacks teams had ever scored fewer runs: the 1998 expansion team and the 2004 group that lost 111 games.         åÛåÏIf Goldy didnåÛåªt go deepåÛå Towers said åÛåÏwe usually didnåÛåªt win.åÛå         Towers believes Trumbo usually a first baseman has the athleticism to start every day in left field. He also believes he has the pitching depth to spare Skaggs who was ranked by Baseball America before last season as the 12th-best prospect in the game.         But he also had little choice. A general manager for most of the last two decades Towers could not remember a time when power was so hard to find.         åÛåÏThatåÛåªs probably why we were so aggressive after this dealåÛå Towers said adding that the team would control Trumbo for three years. åÛåÏWe didnåÛåªt see where the power was going to come from looking at the free-agent market going forward even in the draft.åÛå         Like the Mets the Diamondbacks have shown this winter that nothing today is more precious than power. Four bases with one swing make up for three strikes and youåÛåªre out.
