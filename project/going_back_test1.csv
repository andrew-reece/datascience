Saul spent his entire adult life pursuing and attaining a small measure of justice for Shoah victims. For 70 years Saul made it his life's calling to compel Germany Austria and other entities to acknowledge victims' suffering and restore stolen assets. From the time he created a restitution unit of the US Army in postwar Germany Saul participated in every major negotiation and achievement of this historic endeavor. He led the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany for 47 years and continued to be its invaluable advisor after retiring as Executive Vice President. Saul was the major architect of $80 billion in pensions and compensation payments; billions more in homecare food and medicine for survivors; establishment of the first fund for Righteous Gentiles; fund for displaced community rabbis from Europe; and funds for Holocaust memory such as the creation of Yad Vashem in Israel and the first Holocaust memorial and documentation center in Europe. Yet despite the immensity of his achievements modesty and humility were his hallmarks. Quietly with little fanfare Saul negotiated navigated and built. He saw opportunities before others could understand that they were there; he was a visionary in every sense of the word. Lives were transformed because Saul saw what was possible and he pursued it unrelentingly one step at a time.It was always about making something happen finding the way through solving the problem it was never about him. All that mattered was that the cause was right and that the result would benefit those who needed the most. He proved that courage and faith can infuse daily events with historical significance and he understood when historical events could make the unimaginable possible. Saul both created history through his efforts and used history to create new possibilities. Throughout the decades Saul was the Claims Conferences leader its historian and the voice for those who suffered beyond measure. Survivors have lost a champion and we have lost a beloved and wise friend. Our deepest sympathies are with his dear wife Eleanor daughter Julia step-children Jonathan and Emily Lobatto and his family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.

20,100000002546391,0,Article,News,Your Money,your-money,,Tidying Up Your Financial Life,CARL RICHARDS,706,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/your-money/tidying-up-your-financial-life.html,,"From buying a home to paying for college our financial decisions seem more complex and it often seems as if things are far beyond our control. It leads to a feeling of anxiety. Plus were so busy making money trying to make ends meet that it seems all but impossible to manage it in any meaningful way. Who has the time to track a monthly budget?         Sounds chaotic right? Its moments like these when were overwhelmed and unsure of what to do next that we should remember the musician  Brian Enos wise words :         When in doubt tidy up.         I think  Ron Liebers Financial Tuneup  offers a perfect example of this tidying-up advice:         To be a modern American consumer is to be plagued by a never-ending guilt-inducing stream of undone tasks he writes. Knocking these things off can get rid of the low-grade anxiety that results from the under-optimization of your financial life. But the real appeal is green cash money. If you could just cross a bunch of items off your list there might be four figures in annual savings awaiting you.         Curious how to tidy up your financial chaos? I suggest doing these three things:          1. Realize that the universe doesnt like order.   We may like order  but the universe doesnt  as Adam Frank a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Rochester writes in a September piece on NPR's website: ""Physicists discovered that universes inevitable slide from order to chaos  is the forward movement of time . They even have a name for it:  entropy . And entropys cosmic increase is demanded by the new piece of physics they discovered: the (hallowed)  second law of thermodynamics.   The forward march of chaos  from your newly tidied desk to the eventual mess it will return to  that is the  second law of thermodynamics  and the forward movement of time.         Since we cant fight the second law of thermodynamics it seems wise for us to reset our expectations. Making the bed once doesnt mean it will never need to be made again. Yes we can add order to our lives but like a garden it will need regular tending or the weeds will choke out the good stuff. By understanding that chaos is a part of things we can take some steps to counter its worst effects.          2. Throw away some stuff.   I love throwing away things. Its very satisfying. For our purposes here focus on old or irrelevant financial documents. Clear out the drawers and I promise youll feel lighter afterward.         Then theres the current stuff. Dont even open credit card offers. Shred them and eliminate the decision fatigue of deciding whether to apply. Open your bills once. Pay them. Then shred them too. Dont let piles of stuff accumulate that you then have to go back through six months later.          3. Automate as much as possible.   Ron mentioned it in his Tuneup but I want to highlight it again. We should automate all the good financial decisions available to us. If we have an extra $500 we want to move to savings each month automate it. If we can set up a low-fee diversified 401(k) do so then leave it alone.         The goal with automation isnt to take the smart thinking out of financial decisions but instead to cut back on the wasted thinking. For instance we can even automate some of our thinking. Before we go to the grocery store prepare a list of exactly whats needed. It makes it much easier to resist those impulse buys if they arent on the list.         Do the same thing with extended warranties and other add-ons that get offered at checkout. Decide in advance then we dont have to think about it. Just think about what we can do with all that mental RAM weve freed up.         Yes the universe loves chaos but theres no reason that we cant tame our little corner of it for a time. In fact its those moments of order that will help us get through the next busy day and the next big financial decision. Keep that in mind the next time life feels out of control and when in doubt tidy up. I think youll like the results.        "

23,100000002545519,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,international,Energy Crunch for Britain’s Poor,BETH GARDINER,1496,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/international/energy-crunch-for-britains-poor.html,,LONDON  Avagay Mowatt knows that there will be times this winter just as there were last year when she will have to choose between giving her children a hot meal and bath and keeping their home warm.         With Britains biggest utility companies announcing price increases of as much as 10 percent in recent weeks Ms. Mowatt is certain to struggle again to keep enough credit on her meter  which she has to feed before she can turn on the gas supply. When she can afford it she goes to a nearby shop to put 15 pounds or $24 on a card that she inserts in the meter; but in the cold months that money never lasts long.         Sometimes what I do is I dont turn the heating on in order for me to be able to cook and bathe the kids she said. She and the children aged 7 and 5 huddle under blankets in her bedroom on chilly days she said: We shut the door and block up the bottom so we keep the heat in.         How will Ms. Mowatt a single mother living on public assistance in Brent northwest London manage this winter? I have no idea she says. I try not to think about it.         Many Britons share such fears. With wages stagnant after years of economic woes and government austerity about 2.4 million households suffer fuel poverty the government estimates.         David Rose a spokesman at Energy Solutions North West London a local advice agency helping Ms. Mowatt said demand for assistance was running twice as high as last year.         People are desperately worried said Mervyn Kohler a spokesman for Age UK which aids the elderly. They have been turning down their thermostats living in one room wearing overcoats even when theyre in their own homes going to bed early.          The recent  natural gas  and electricity rate hikes have touched off a political furor prompting angry exchanges between Prime Minister David Cameron and the leader of the opposition Labour Party Ed Miliband.         For weeks the argument has dominated headlines with Mr. Miliband blaming the jump on energy firms hunger for profits and Mr. Cameron blaming excessive environmental levies for driving up bills that have nearly doubled in real terms since 2005.         Mr. Cameron has slammed his opponent as a con man and Mr. Miliband has accused the prime minister of serving as the unofficial spokesman for the energy companies. The debate is likely to sit squarely at the center of the coming campaign for parliamentary elections due in 2015.         The energy issues that Britain faces are complex and central to sometimes competing concerns about sagging living standards a warming climate a pressing need for investment in aging power infrastructure and fears of possible blackouts.         About 60 percent of the price increases have been driven by rises in the wholesale cost of energy the Department of Energy and Climate Change estimates. Natural gas remains expensive in Europe unlike in the United States where a boom in fuel from shale has pushed prices down.         Whats remarkable about all this discussion is the absence of facts said Dieter Helm an energy policy professor at Oxford University. None of them have got long-term energy policies sorted out and none of them have got their  climate change  policies sorted out.         The latest round of debate began in September when Mr. Miliband announced that if elected Labour would impose a 20-month freeze on utility prices using the time to improve energy market regulation.         Tabloid newspapers revived their old nickname for him Red Ed and Mr. Cameron accused him of wanting to live in a Marxist universe. But even Mr. Cameron acknowledged that the proposal had struck a chord among struggling Britons. It has proved popular bolstering Labours poll numbers and putting the prime minister on the defensive.         Mr. Cameron who once promised to lead the greenest government ever now blames the cost of renewable energy for Britons high bills and is promising to review the green levies that help fund investment in clean power. He has also called for an examination of whether the market dominated by six big companies could be made more competitive.         That represents a sharp policy turn away from his earlier use of environmentalism to rebrand his Conservative Party as progressive after three straight election defeats.        
24,100000002545517,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,energy-environment,Japan’s Delicate Search for a Way to Breed Tuna on an Industrial Scale,YURIKO NAGANO,1082,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/energy-environment/japans-delicate-search-for-a-way-to-breed-tuna-on-an-industrial-scale.html,,NAGASAKI Japan  Keiichi Mushiake slowly pushes back the red velvet curtains of a brand new viewing hallway in a fisheries research lab near Nagasaki to reveal behind a plate glass window a dimly lit round pool. Sleek dark shadowy objects are darting in circles around the emerald green waters.         Those are Pacific bluefin tuna Mr. Mushiake said.         There are 48 fish in the pool averaging 110 centimeters or 3.6 feet in length and 18 kilograms or 40 pounds in weight. A similar pool nearby holds an additional 41.         Security is tight at the tuna aquaculture research center opened in 2011 at the Seikai National Fisheries Research Institute here. Access to the tank area is strictly limited. Signs inside and outside the viewing hall forbid photography.         Were trying to protect our technology said Mr. Mushiake the institutes director.         The center is part of an intensive effort to develop bluefin tuna farming on an industrial scale  an effort which pits sushi-loving Japan in fierce competition with South Korea Australia and Spain.         The research centers two pools measuring about 20 meters or 65 feet across and six meters or 20 feet deep are the first in the world built on land for the specific purpose of harvesting fertilized Pacific bluefin tuna eggs.         Built with 2.1 billion yen or $21.2 million provided by the Japanese Fisheries Agency the pools started operating in May with an estimated annual operating budget of Â¥70 million to Â¥100 million Mr. Mushiake said.         Were trying to keep kuro-maguro available while reducing and ultimately phasing out the catch of wild fish said Mr Mushiake using the Japanese name for Pacific bluefin.         Of all the types of tuna Pacific bluefin is the most prized in Japan. According to government figures Japanese consume 70 percent of the worlds annual Pacific bluefin tuna catch or about 21000 tons last year mostly as sushi or sashimi.         The global value of the market is unclear but the average price of a whole wild bluefin tuna is $40 to $50 per kilogram while the price for farmed fish ranges from $12 to $30 per kilo according to a 2007 report by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.         The price depends on the quality of the fish the way it is caught and the season it is caught  winter being best  said Shigeru Miyashita director of the fisheries laboratory at the Wakayama campus of Kinki University who likened it to another favored Japanese delicacy high-quality Kobe beef.         With global environmental protection treaties such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species leaning toward listing Pacific bluefin tuna as an endangered species finding a better way to farm the fish has become of national importance.         The farming of Pacific bluefin is not new. Japan has 140 established farms including 60 in the Nagasaki area alone growing the fish from age three months to adulthood.         The scale of production however has always been limited by the supply of fingerlings. Pacific bluefin are highly sensitive to their environment: Getting them to spawn in a completely artificial environment has never been achieved  and when they do spawn the loss rate of fertilized eggs is extremely high.         This is the problem that the Nagasaki research center and a sister facility on Amami-Oshima Island in Kagoshima Prefecture  which has been working on Pacific bluefin research since 1995  are trying to solve.         The challenges are multiple and complex. For starters the fish are sensitive to harsh weather.         In years where there are many typhoons weve seen cases where farmed kuro-maguro do not spawn Mr. Mushiake said.         In addition the skin of Pacific bluefin is delicate and human contact can be fatal he said; the farmed fish are susceptible to viral diseases such as iridoviruses which can damage their spleen; at an early stage of their development they are prone to devour any food in reach including one another; and if they are disturbed by external factors such as loud noises they have a tendency to go into a potentially fatal hyperactive speed burst in which they may swim into the pool walls and break their own necks.        
25,100000002545518,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,energy-environment,Solar Power Begins to Shine as Environmental Benefits Pay Off,DIANA S. POWERS,1373,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/energy-environment/solar-power-begins-to-shine-as-environmental-benefits-pay-off.html,,PARIS  Amid polemics over rising electricity prices in Europe and the level of green energy subsidies in various countries it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the growth in clean-energy generation is a huge success story.         Solar photovoltaic generation known as PV like wind power before it is coming into the mainstream  at great environmental benefit.         Based on comparative life-cycle analyses of power sources PV electricity contributes 96 percent to 98 percent less greenhouse gases than electricity generated from 100 percent coal and 92 percent to 96 percent less greenhouse gases than the European electricity mix said Carol Olson a researcher at the Energy Research Center of the Netherlands.         Photovoltaic generation offers several additional environmental advantages Ms. Olson said in an interview.         Compared with electricity from coal PV electricity over its lifetime uses 86 to 89 percent less water occupies or transforms over 80 percent less land presents approximately 95 percent lower toxicity to humans contributes 92 to 97 percent less to acid rain and 97 to 98 percent less to marine eutrophication she said. Eutrophication is the discharge of excess nutrients that causes algal blooms.         Toward the end of last year installed global photovoltaic generating capacity passed the milestone of 100 gigawatts  enough to meet the energy needs of 30 million households and save more than 53 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually according to a recent report by the European Photovoltaic Industry Association E.P.I.A. a  solar power  industry lobby group.         Right now today the world has installed 130 gigawatts of PV up from 1.4 gigawatts in 2000 Wolfgang Palz a former manager of the European Commissions development program for renewable energies told a conference organized by Frances National Center for Scientific Research CNRS in Paris last month.         Europe alone now has 80 gigawatts of installed photovoltaic capacity of which 35 gigawatts is in Germany the European Union leader providing about 7 percent of the countrys electricity he said.         Some regions of Germany are even further ahead: If you buy an Audi today manufactured in Bavaria 10 percent of the electricity used to produce it is PV Mr. Palz said in an interview.         With large-volume installation economies of scale have substantially reduced unit costs.         According to a report by the E.P.I.A. the European solar industrys lobby group photovoltaic costs have dropped 22 percent with every doubling of production capacity.         Going back 10 to 15 years we had to fight to find some crazy people who would install solar panels for $70 per watt on the rooftop said Eicke Weber director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Freiburg Germany.         We had to find some market support systems for the first thousand-roof program Mr. Weber said. That became the 100000-roof program  and then the million-roof program.         Now the number that should be broadcast is that in Germany now we are able to put PV systems on the rooftop for one euro per watt or $1.34 with the back-up system with the inverter and with the cost of installation Mr. Weber said. An inverter is a device that converts the direct current electricity produced by solar generation into alternating current that can be fed into the electrical grid.         In other countries in the United States its about a factor of two to three more expensive he added.         The rapid expansion of renewable energy generation in Europe has been driven by policy and specifically by the provision of relatively high guaranteed prices for renewable energy sold into the transmission grid  known as feed-in tariffs.         Ahead of the 2009 United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen the European Union adopted a set of targets committing it to a 20 percent reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels; an increase in the renewables share of E.U. energy consumption to 20 percent; and a 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency  all by 2020.         Since then feed-in tariffs have been one of the main drivers of cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. The other has been reduced industrial activity resulting from economic recession. Between them they appear to have been remarkably effective.        
26,100000002538217,0,Article,News,Booming,booming,,The Blackout That Exposed the Flaws in the Grid,MATTHEW L. WALD,1345,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/booming/the-blackout-that-exposed-the-flaws-in-the-grid.html,, On a late Thursday afternoon in the summer of 2003 everything turned off. As this weeks Retro Report video illustrates in the span of a few minutes the biggest power outage in United States history brought swaths of the Northeast the Midwest and Canada to a standstill. Around 50 million people were left without power.  In the days and weeks that followed reporters and investigators raced to pinpoint the source of the outage while larger questions swirled about the stability of the power grid in the 21st century. Here a Times reporter who covers energy technology reflects on that day and the changes that resulted.    When the  lights went out for 50 million people on Aug. 14 2003  most of them knew only that they themselves had lost electricity not that a tightly knit system had been ripped apart all the way from Detroit to Toronto to New York City. Even the people in electric control centers were confused; some of those in the Midwest knew the magnitude of the problem only because they were watching CNN which showed a blacked-out Times Square.         I had been at the Indian Point nuclear plant that morning to report an article about handling nuclear waste. By 4 P.M. I was in southern Westchester in my parents kitchen unplugging the telephone so I could connect it to my laptop modem and file to The Times. As I connected the phone line to the modem the lights went out.         Matthew what have you done? my mother asked. In daylight its hard to tell that the whole neighborhood has been switched off but a battery-powered radio tuned to an AM station (then popular  it was still 2003) confirmed that New York City was also dark.         I was soon kicking myself for having left the nuclear plant where I might have witnessed the complicated series of responses that must be taken in a blackout to avoid a meltdown (as would be demonstrated eight years later in Fukushima Japan).         Even when the extent of the blackout was clear the origin was not. In those days determining the sequence took weeks of tedious forensic work by engineers who gathered data from recorders at hundreds of locations and then synchronized them to establish the chronology of what was cause and what was effect. Today more of that data is available in real time.         The engineers determined that the immediate source of the problem was a cluster of lines that had failed in Ohio unnoticed by local operators causing electricity to surge into lines that were still open until those overloaded and led to a cascade.         It was less than two years after the attacks of Sept. 11 2001 and terrorism was on everyones mind. For many people so was New Yorks fate in the  last big blackout  in July 1977 when rioters had looted and burned hundreds of shops and stores. Some remembered  November 1965  when a blackout hit most of the Northeast and the instant suspicion was a Soviet attack. But it was the spirit of Sept. 11 that prevailed with remarkable cooperation and patience.         The grid especially in those days was opaque even to its operators and problems became apparent with far too little warning for anything to be done about it. Automatic relays (basically industrial-scale circuit breakers) were programmed to protect equipment not to ride out any disturbance and as each one acted isolating a power line or a transformer the disturbance got bigger and bigger until a huge house of cards collapsed. Later investigation showed that some utilities did not realize how prone their relays were to unplugging key components of the system.         But the investigation also showed that there was nothing high tech about the causes. One power company FirstEnergy had neglected to trim trees near its high voltage lines and on hot days when power demand is high the metal in those lines gets longer and the lines sag; in this case three of them hit the trees creating short circuits that took the lines out of service. The regional grid coordinator the Midwest Independent System Operator was supposed to have a computer program in place to monitor power flows. A technician had shut it off to upgrade the software and then gone to lunch without turning it back on or telling the operators what he had done. The operators themselves were not properly trained.         Neglect and error cause all kinds of problems in industrial operations but the grid is a bit different finely balanced and tightly linked and one bad actor became something like a drunken sailor in a canoe.         Before the blackout Congress had dithered for years about whether to institute mandatory performance standards for companies on the grid. The blackout settled the question although the details were far too complicated for the government itself to put into effect. The Energy Department hired a pre-existing voluntary organization which became the North American Electric Reliability Corporation to develop consensus standards and then enforce them.         Utilities that had previously checked boxes on forms indicating that they were complying with recommended standards were now audited to see if they were meeting mandatory rules.

27,100000002545349,0,Article,An Analysis,Sports,sports,football,Week 10 N.F.L. Quick Hits: A Broncos Offense That Builds,ANDY BENOIT,1705,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/sports/football/week-10-nfl-quick-hits-a-broncos-offense-that-builds.html,, Broncos 28 Chargers 20   Demaryius Thomass three touchdowns were a microcosm of the great Broncos offense on Sunday.         The first touchdown came on one of Denvers staple tight red zone plays. It was a slot out-route to the flat with the outside wide receiver blocking out in front.         The second touchdown was an example of whats called building offense which is when plays derive from earlier plays. Its something the Broncos do better than any team. In this instance the field position and receiver alignment were similar to Thomass first score. Thomas again ran an out-route. This time cornerback Shareece Wright knowing Denvers tendencies sat on it.         Peyton Manning expecting that Wright would play the tendency called a route that had Thomas make the out-cut but then immediately redirect back inside. It was an easy touchdown.         The third touchdown was a masterpiece. Manning motioned Thomas out wide creating a three-receiver set to the left. It was a quick screen which was the perfect call against the edge blitz that San Diego brought. The brilliant part was Mannings post-snap adjustment. There were two defenders directly in the passing lane ready to bat down the ball. Upon throwing Manning took the slightest of steps back and contorted his arm angle to deliver the ball cleanly. Thomass raw athleticism along with great out-in-front blocking by left tackle Chris Clark and slot receiver Wes Welker did the rest.          Saints 49 Cowboys 17   The box score pretty much says it all. The Saints had 383 yards passing and 242 yards rushing. A league-record 40 of their 80 plays resulted in a first down. Drew Brees was working against a backup-laden Cowboys defense that will now be without top linebacker Sean Lee for at least a few weeks and still doesnt have a healthy defensive line (DeMarcus Ware was productive but nowhere near 100 percent in his first game back from a quad injury). November has typically been a good month for the Cowboys but that seems destined to change.          Panthers 10 49ers 9   The Niners offense entered this game ranked first on the ground but dead last through the air. Old-school as Jim Harbaugh might be he knows this is not a formula for success in todays N.F.L. It certainly wasnt Sunday. San Francisco gave up six sacks totaling a loss of 45 yards. That was about half of the total passing yardage this offense posted altogether which explains why the point total matched the abbreviated version of the clubs name. For the Panthers believe it or not the 9 points allowed was pretty much par for the course. Behind an invigorated front seven Ron Riveras defense is giving up 10.3 points per contest. Only Buffalo has scored more than 15 points against Carolina. (And recall Buffalo did it on some rather improbable late-game heroics.)          Cardinals 27 Texans 24   On the Texans final hurry-up drive with the game on the line the Cardinal defense did something rare: it used blitzes in its default coverage. When protecting a late lead like this most defenses play a version of two-deep coverage like Cover-2 (zone) 2-man (man-to-man) or Quarters (a hybrid). They keep as many bodies as possible in coverage  especially when the opposing team has no timeouts. But the Cardinal defensive coordinator Todd Bowles knows that his unit is at its best when its the aggressor. So he played that way. The Cardinals interior pressure disrupted the Texans timing and made quarterback Case Keenum somewhat frenetic sealing a victory that put the Cardinals a game over .500.          Ravens 20 Bengals 17 OT   Its not fair to blame Ravens safety James Ihedigbo for the fact that this game went to overtime. Yes it was Ihedigbos tip on the hail-mary pass that sent the ball into A.J. Greens hands. But that was the second time the ball had been tipped making it the games second-most random event behind only the coin toss (or tosses). Even if we were to say that Ihedigbos tip was questionable defense the offensively challenged Ravens probably would not have even been protecting a late lead in that situation if not for the veteran safetys two interceptions and team-leading nine tackles.

29,100000002545363,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,basketball,Game to Watch: Pacers Streak Toward Chicago,JONAH BROMWICH,692,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/sports/basketball/game-to-watch-pacers-streak-toward-chicago.html,,Each week during the N.B.A. season The New York Times will choose one essential game to watch highlighting hot teams winning and losing streaks and statistical intrigue.         Indiana at Chicago          8 p.m. Saturday   The  Indiana Pacers  start the third week of the season undefeated after seven games. Early in the week they host Memphis and Milwaukee  the Bucks with their defensive solidity figure to be the tougher opponent  but if the Pacers continue to play as they have they will arrive in Chicago in prime time Saturday with their perfect record intact.         The Pacers are already off to the best start in franchise history. The 1993-94 Houston Rockets hold the record for the most wins to begin an N.B.A. season; they went 15-0 on their way to a championship.         The Pacers have started this season much the way they ended the last one: with a suffocating defense paired with a live-wire offense. They are holding teams to 86.8 points every hundred possessions making them the most efficient defensive team in the league.         They lead the league in blocks averaging nearly 10 per game. That figure is in large part thanks to Roy Hibbert who has 30 blocks through seven games giving him more than half the teams in the league. It is no wonder opponents are shooting a dismal .389 against the Pacers.         Indianas fifth win against Chicago was its most decisive yet quieting those who wondered if last years Eastern Conference finalists were a fluke. The Pacers beat the  Bulls  by 17 points prompting Hibbert to tweet DPOY suggesting that he should be the leagues defensive player of the year. He followed that by predicting that teammate Paul George would be named the leagues most valuable player.         George told  NBA.com  after the Bulls game that the Pacers were looking to step away from the Bulls shadow as the little brothers of this division.         Even if Hibberts prediction is a tad early George is having a monster season so far. Last seasons most improved player he is averaging about 25 points 8 rebounds 4 assists and 2 steals. Thats enough to place him in the top 10 in player efficiency ratings two spots above the reigning most valuable player LeBron James. The Bucks Zaza Pachulia is also ahead of James which serves as a reminder to take early-season PER ratings with a grain of salt.         Meanwhile the Bulls have had a less than stellar start. Aside from the 17-point loss to the Pacers they have dropped close games to the Miami Heat and the Philadelphia 76ers and just narrowly beat a less than impressive Knicks team. The Bulls only decisive win came against the Utah Jazz who have started 0-7.         Coming into the season many were looking to Derrick Rose to be the Bulls savior but he has not played the part so far. Rose has a 32 percent shooting average with a plus/minus -5.8 which means that at least on offense he is hurting the team more than he is helping.         The Bulls defensive staples are still intact. They are the fifth-best rebounding team in the league and are allowing fewer points per possession than anyone except the Pacers. But they have been hurt by Roses shooting and they do not have many players aside from him who can create their own shots.         But this Pacers-Bulls meeting if not the early measuring stick many might have expected could be the game that results in the Pacers first defeat. The Bulls under Tom Thibodeau have a history of ending winning streaks including Miamis 27-game stretch last year. Thibodeau is one of the leagues sharper coaches and it is unlikely that he is letting his team sit comfortably with its loss to the Pacers. He kept his team competitive through a stretch of injuries last season and with a full roster at his disposal now it is a good bet he will have the Bulls turned around soon.

On the punt return Austin listed at 5 feet 8 inches and 176 pounds fooled the Indianapolis coverage team by waving off his teammates as the ball bounced. Most of the Colts slowed or stopped as they prepared to down the punt but Austin taking a risk grabbed the ball at his own 2 and sprinted down the right sideline. Even Rams Coach Jeff Fisher was surprised. I went from saying Get away get away get away to Go go go!Â  Fisher said.         The Saints  Drew Brees  completed 34 of 41 passes for 392 yards and 4 touchdowns in a win over the Cowboys.         Quarterback  Russell Wilson  and running back  Marshawn Lynch  led the Seahawks to a rout of the Falcons. Wilson was 19 of 26 for 287 yards and 2 touchdowns. Lynch ran 24 times for 145 yards and a score. They also combined on a trick play in the second quarter. Wilson handed off to Lynch who passed the ball back to the quarterback. Wilson threw it to Jermaine Kearse for a 43-yard touchdown.

Then after a four-game losing streak ended with a home win againstÂ Cincinnati the Dolphins prepared to face Tampa Bay and seemed poised for another run of victories. The positive feelings changed when the second-year tackle Jonathan Martin abruptly left the team and guard Richie Incognito was suspended amid allegations of bullying.         Not too long ago Tampa Bay was consumed with its own soap opera mostly related to the benching and release of quarterback Josh Freeman. The Buccaneers are most likely enjoying the lack of attention while they try to turn around their season. But they still appear to be headed in the wrong direction.         In its first four games Tampa Bay gave up an average of 17.5 points; in the next four games it gave up an average of 30 points. In Week 9 the Buccaneers surrendered a 21-point lead againstÂ Seattle. The question is whether the players will be able to refocus and find a way to capitalize on the Dolphins turmoil. The answer is probably not.

31,100000002544882,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,media,"Gun Violence in American Movies Is Rising, Study Finds",MICHAEL CIEPLY,434,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/media/gun-violence-in-american-movies-is-rising-study-finds.html,5,LOS ANGELES  A study set for publication in the December issue of Pediatrics confirms what some of Hollywoods sharpest critics have suspected: The level of gun violence in the top-selling PG-13 movies has been rising and it now exceeds that in the most popular R-rated films.         Violent encounters with guns occur on average more than twice an hour in the best sellers in both ratings categories according to researchers who worked with support from the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.         In all the researchers examined 945 movies counting the appearances of overall violence in each five-minute segment of a sampling of films that ranked among the top 30 at the domestic box office from 1950 to 2012. Perhaps not surprisingly the results  reported by Brad J. Bushman of Ohio State University and Patrick E. Jamieson Ilana Weitz and Daniel Romer of the Annenberg center  showed that violence in American films had more than doubled in that time.         But the authors also found that episodes of gun violence in PG-13 rated films had been rising since the rating was introduced in the mid-1980s and it now surpasses the violence in R-rated films which are technically not open to young viewers unless they are accompanied by an adult.         Speaking by telephone last week Mr. Romer one of the authors acknowledged that the study by focusing only on the top-selling movies each year said as much about audience behavior as about the level of violence in Hollywoods output.         Violence sells he said. We recognize that and the movie industry realizes it.         Mr. Romer said he believed that movie studios were taking films that have a lot of violence and putting them into the PG-13 category.         In announcing the study its authors called for changes to the ratings system which according to some of its critics is tougher on sex than on violence. We treat sex as R Mr. Romer said in the announcement. We should treat extreme gun violence as R.         A spokeswoman for the Motion Picture Association of America which oversees the domestic film ratings system in partnership with theater owners declined to discuss the study.         The study included animated films and it made no distinction between acts of aggression and self-defense. It did not highlight specific titles and it did not distinguish between films with a clear anti-violence message and those with a more cavalier attitude toward gunplay.         We just think that violence especially the kind being shown especially with guns should be thought of a little more critically Mr. Romer said.         This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 11 2013 An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the type of violence the researchers were looking for when they examined 945 films made from 1950 until 2012. It was for violence in general not just gun violence.
32,100000002545113,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,,Postal Service to Make Sunday Deliveries for Amazon,RON NIXON,780,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/postal-service-and-amazon-strike-deal.html,1,WASHINGTON  The cash-short United States Postal Service which has failed to win congressional approval to stop delivering mail on Saturdays to save money has struck a deal with the online retailer  Amazon.com  to deliver the companys packages on Sundays  a first for both with obvious advantages for each.         For the Postal Service which  lost nearly $16 billion last year  first-class mail delivery particularly on Saturdays is often a money loser whereas package delivery is profitable.         The deal announced on Sunday and taking effect immediately in time for the holiday shopping season gives the Postal Service a chance to take some business from United Parcel Service and FedEx which do not deliver on Sundays. Now some orders that would have been handled by either of those carriers for Monday delivery will go through the Postal Service and arrive on Sunday.         The Postal Service said it expected to make more such deals with other merchants seeking a larger role in the $186 billion e-commerce market. Amazon.com would not say if it would try to arrange Sunday deliveries with other parcel carriers.         For this holiday shopping season Sunday delivery of Amazon products will be limited to the Los Angeles and New York metropolitan areas which in New Yorks case includes parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. In 2014 it is expected to expand to other cities including Dallas Houston New Orleans and Phoenix.         Among the primary beneficiaries of the new delivery schedule will be Amazon Prime members who pay an annual fee for premium services including free two-day shipping for certain items said Kelly Cheeseman a spokeswoman for Amazon. Now every day can be an Amazon delivery day Ms. Cheeseman said.         Postal Service officials called the agreement an important step in diversifying its services and expanding those that make a profit. Consumers have shown that there is a market for package deliveries seven days a week and we are glad to be in a position to partner with Amazon on providing this service said Patrick R. Donahoe the postmaster general.         Neither Amazon nor the Postal Service would disclose financial arrangements or discuss the volume or revenue they expected to generate from Sunday deliveries. The Postal Service already delivers some packages on Sundays and holidays for an extra fee.         Shipping and package services have been one of the  few bright spots  for the beleaguered Postal Service. First-class mail its main source of revenue declined to almost 69 billion pieces last year from nearly 92 billion in 2008.         That contributed to a decline in revenue to $65 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 2012 from nearly $75 billion in 2008. Shipping and package volume has increased to about 3.5 billion pieces since 2008 and accounts for about $11.6 billion in revenue for the agency.         Mr. Donahoe the postmaster general said the deal with Amazon was part of the Postal Services attempt to alter its business model. That effort includes increasing package delivery to take advantage of the growth of e-commerce streamlining the work force and eliminating mail delivery on Saturdays.         Though the Postal Service would continue to deliver packages on Saturdays the proposal to halt Saturday delivery has  met resistance  from the business sector and some members of Congress. A move to cut Saturday delivery would save about $2 billion annually postal officials said.         The agency faces myriad problems that have led to its financial decline. It faces legal constraints that prevent it from diversifying into certain lines of business. It is also barred from raising postage prices faster than the rate of inflation.         But an even bigger cause of the financial decline is a 2006 law that requires the Postal Service unlike any other government agency to pay $5.5 billion a year into a health fund for its future retirees. The majority of the agencys losses since 2007 about $32 billion result from  the health funding requirement  financial documents show.         As a result of its financial troubles the Postal Service has defaulted on three annual $5.5 billion payments into the health care fund. It has also exhausted its $15 billion borrowing limit from the Treasury Department. More recently the agency has asked for permission to  raise its postage prices  to help cover costs.         Congress is considering legislation that would overhaul the agency and ease the financial constraints but few anticipate a bill passing this year as lawmakers continue to wrestle with broader budget issues.         Weve got to get this done Mr. Donahoe said. The faster we can get it done the faster we can focus attention away from all the negative attention about our financial situation and onto the positive things we do like this new agreement with Amazon.

The homeowner said it sounded like she was trying to break in. But how much of a threat can someone be?Â          Cheryl A. Carpenter a lawyer for the homeowner who has not been named by the authorities  told The Detroit News  that she was confident when the evidence comes it will show that my client was justified and acted as a reasonable person would who was in fear for his life. Ms. Carpenter did not respond to messages seeking comment lateÂ Sunday.Â          The case comes in the wake of protests that swept the nation this summer when a neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was acquitted after fatally shooting a black teenager Trayvon Martin during an altercation in Sanford Fla. Mr. Martin had been buying snacks. In September in Charlotte N.C. a police officer was charged with voluntary manslaughter after  he shot and killed  Jonathan Ferrell 24 a former college football player who had also been seeking help after a car accident.         Ms. McBrides case has stoked similar outrage and was the subject of at least two protests and rallies this weekend said LaToya Henry of the Detroit branch of the N.A.A.C.P. because this was a young black woman in a neighborhood that is predominantly white. The local and national N.A.A.C.P. will await a final report before deciding on further actions Ms. Henry said.         The investigation into the death is continuing Maria Miller a spokeswoman for the Wayne County prosecutors officeÂ said on Sunday. The police will present evidence to prosecutors this week she said so we can make a decision on whether to issue charges.Â          Rev. W. J. Rideout III a pastor at All Gods People Church in Detroit who attended a vigil last week at the home where the shooting occurred said the family was disheartened. They dont feel like the justice system has given them justice he said.Â          He shouldnt be walking the streets he said of the homeowner. This sends out a message that its O.K. to shoot people.         Steven Yaccino contributed reporting.

35,100000002541455,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,,"Textbooks Reassess Kennedy, Putting Camelot Under Siege",ADAM CLYMER,1602,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/us/textbooks-reassess-kennedy-putting-camelot-under-siege.html,1,WASHINGTON  The President John F. Kennedy students learn about today is not their grandparents J.F.K.         In a high school textbook edited by John M. Blum in 1968 Kennedy was a tragic hero cut down too soon in a transformative presidency who in his mere 1000 days in office revived the idea of America as a young questing progressive land facing the future with confidence and hope.         By the mid-'80s that heady excitement was a distant memory and Kennedy a diminished one. A textbook written in 1987 by James A. Henretta and several colleagues complained of gauzy mythologizing about his tenure and said the high hopes he generated produced only rather meager legislative accomplishments.         The first  and for many the last  in-depth lesson that American students learn about the 35th president comes from high school textbooks. And on the eve of the anniversary of his assassination 50 years ago a review of more than two dozen written since then shows that the portrayal of him has fallen sharply over the years.         In general the picture has evolved from a charismatic young president who inspired youths around the world to a deeply flawed one whose oratory outstripped his accomplishments. Averting war in the Cuban missile crisis got less attention and respect. Legislative setbacks and a deepening commitment in Vietnam got more. The Kennedy-era glamour seemed more image than reality.         For example a 1975 high school text by Clarence Ver Steeg and Richard Hofstadter said that in his handling of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis Kennedys true nature as a statesman became fully apparent. In A People and a Nation they said his 1963 limited nuclear test ban treaty was the greatest single step toward peace since the beginning of the Cold War.         On civil rights they said his administration did not receive congressional cooperation. Even so they wrote inaccurately buses hotels motels and restaurants were largely desegregated in his presidency. Most of those changes came when the Civil Rights Act was signed by his successor Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.         Using the same title in 1982 Mary Beth Norton and several others took a very different approach in a college textbook widely used today in Advanced Placement courses.         They said he pursued civil rights with a notable lack of vigor. They blamed him for the missile crisis saying Cuban-Soviet fears of invasion were stoked by the 1961 Bay of Pigs landing and other United States moves against Cuba. They said Kennedys real legacy was a huge military expansion that helped goad the Russians into an accelerated arms race.         In 2009 Joyce Applebys American Journey said of the missile crisis: While it seemed like a victory at the time it left a Communist government intact just miles from the U.S. coastline. The humiliation of giving in also prompted the Soviets to begin the largest peacetime military buildup in history.         There are a variety of reasons for the shift. First of all the dazzle of the handsome young president and the assassination in Dallas elevated Kennedy to a heroic level impossible to maintain.         Another is that new writers and editors added different perspectives. In particular the Vietnam generation began writing and editing and Kennedys role in the war began to matter more. Also his extramarital affairs became known providing fodder for criticism. And the release of White House tapes beginning in 1984 showed a coldly pragmatic politician not the idealist on issues like civil rights whom people had heard about or imagined.         Finally the 80s saw a shift in textbook historiography. Gilbert Sewall the director of the  American Textbook Council  a nonprofit organization that reviews educational materials said the older approach concentrated on successes in American history. In the 80s he said that was replaced by a revisionist approach that not only focused on injustices like the mistreatment of Indians but also highlighted flaws of those previously treated as heroic like slaveholding among the founding fathers. The Norton book brought this revisionism into a bright light he said.         This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 18 2013 An article last Monday about how the portrayal of John F. Kennedy in textbooks has changed over the years misidentified the author of a passage about Kennedy in the 1968 textbook National Experience: A History of the United States. It was written by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. one of several co-authors  not by John M. Blum who edited the book and was also a co-author.        Also in Video »

Phillips relieved of his lead position with a one-win Dallas Cowboys team three Novembers ago was again at the helm of an underachieving Texas team a Super Bowl contender gone bad.         There were degrees of difference in the script this time as Phillips guided the two-win  Houston Texans  against the  Arizona Cardinals  (5-4) at University of Phoenix Stadium. Jason Garrett a former N.F.L. quarterback who backed up the Hall of Famer Troy Aikman was the midseason replacement in 2010 for Phillips who was the temporary replacement for Gary Kubiak a former N.F.L. quarterback who backed up the Hall of Famer John Elway.         Phillips the Houston defensive coordinator was not on the hot seat his future in the hands of a capricious owner like the Cowboys Jerry Jones. Phillips was on the warm seat entrusted with holding Kubiaks place as he recovers from the ministroke that felled him as he left the field at halftime of last weeks home game against the Indianapolis Colts.         For the Texans this year it seems not to matter who calls the plays lines up under center carries the ball or patrols the secondary. The more the personnel changes because of injuries illness and ineptitude the more the results stay the same. Missing Kubiak on the sideline and also the All-Pro Arian Foster in the backfield the Texans frittered away a 3-point halftime lead on their way to a 27-24 loss.         It was a franchise-record seventh consecutive defeat during which the Texans have been outscored in the second half 107-26. Their quarterback Case Keenum who tied a team record in his first start against Kansas City by completing six passes of 25 yards or more threw for 201 yards and 3 touchdowns. But he was a combined 2 of 7 through the air on Houstons final drives of the first and second halves.         Keenums favorite target Andre Johnson made two acrobatic catches in the end zone and J. J. Watt had a sack and a fumble recovery in the final minute of the second quarter to give the offense the ball on the Arizona 22. But the Texans (2-7) were unable to ride the momentum Watt had created coming away from the series with no points after Randy Bullocks 40-yard field-goal attempt was blocked by Justin Bethel.         A lot of teams can move down there and make the plays but we didnt do it Phillips said.         He added that the losing streak is obviously upsetting to all of us.         Safety Ed Reed the Texans prized off-season acquisition who lost his starting job to Shiloh Keo insinuated that the team was being outcoached and outplayed.         If youre watching the game its no-brainers Reed said. Certain situations we have to get off the field. We need three and out. You have to also come out as an offense and move the ball. We cant go three and out and put your defense on the field that quick.         He added A lot of soul searching needs to be done as coaches and players.         Foster is expected to have back surgery that will end his season but Kubiak the offensive play-caller could return this week.         I think its too early to tell said Phillips who is in his third go-round as an interim head coach.         This time is especially bittersweet for Phillips because it comes less than a month after the death of his father Bum whose abrupt resignation from the Saints in 1985 resulted in Phillipss first temporary promotion. In 2003 Phillips guided the Atlanta Falcons to a 2-1 finish after taking over for Dan Reeves.         Kubiak 52 fell to his knees as he walked off the field after experiencing a transient ischemic attack a condition that causes stroke symptoms by temporarily stopping blood flow to the brain. The Texans who were ahead by 18 points at the time came out in the second half unsure of Kubiaks condition and perhaps not surprisingly lost their lead and the game by 27-24.         Kubiak made an appearance at practice Thursday two days after being released from a hospital. He was there ostensibly to show his players he was on the mend but perhaps also to deliver the message however subliminal that he would not be easily pushed aside. After coaching the Texans to back-to-back A.F.C. South titles Kubiak had lost the support of some fans who last month started calling for a paper-bag protest at home games.         In the N.F.L. head coaches do get time off often with pay. Their idea of vacation is what the rest of the working world would call being between jobs. By that measure Phillips last enjoyed time away from football in December 2010 before his January 2011 hiring by the Texans. If the Texans cannot finish strongly Kubiak may end up with more time to regain his health than his heart desires.                Also in T Magazine »

Lawmakers acknowledged however that their efforts would most likely be undermined if the airplane makers machinists union votes down a proposed labor contract due to go before the membership on Wednesday.         A contract locking in Boeings labor costs along with the tax incentives is crucial to state officials plan to keep the 777X production local. Boeing has said that without approval of the labor contract it would be looking at other potential locations.         Industry experts say Washington faces competition from states including South Carolina where Boeing assembles some of its 787 Dreamliners as well as Texas and Utah.         Japan whose heavy industry builds wings for the  Dreamliner  is seen as a contender to build the wings for the 777X the longest wings designed for a Boeing jetliner.         The tax measure passed the Washington State Senate by a vote of 42 to 2 on Saturday with the State House later approving it on a 75-to-11 vote.         Gov. Jay Inslee a Democrat said on Saturday that he planned to sign the measure this week.         The $9 billion measure would extend aerospace tax breaks set to expire in 2024 through 2040 and enact incentives for building airplane factories on the condition that Boeing site its 777X wing fabrication and final assembly in Washington State.         Our vote isnt near as important as theirs Senator Brian Hatfield a Democrat said of the vote by members of the International Association of Machinists.

He is a newcomer to this quiet corner of south-central Pennsylvania who retired here after a long Coast Guard career.         But in the throw-out-the-bums anger percolating in the election cycle now underway Mr. Halvorson 58 believes he might have a shot to displace a name that has occupied this House seat since Mr. Shusters father won it in 1972. After two House elections dominated by the small-government philosophy of the  Tea Party  2014 may be driven by a less ideological but more emotional sentiment: clean house.         People dont remember a time before the Shusters Mr. Halvorson said. They created an aristocracy and people are so accustomed to thats the way politics is done around here they dont see how he can be toppled. Ive got to show leaderships whats important not seniority and longevity is not leadership.         The outcome of this and at least 17 other primaries next year may have a negligible impact on Republican control of the House. Few would suggest that Pennsylvanias Ninth Congressional District is in danger of slipping into Democratic hands. But in the heated battle over the ideological future of the  Republican Party  races like this one could alter the complexion of the Republican caucus in the House  and Washingtons ability to govern in President Obamas final years in office.         Thats the narrative everybody wants to know: Whats the Republican Party going to look like after Ted Cruz Tea Party people get done with it? Mr. Halvorson asked eschewing the Tea Party label even as he adopts many of its campaign tropes. Whos going to have the ascendancy?         From Tennessee to Michigan to Oregon House Republicans are facing an onslaught of primary challenges. But unlike the last two election cycles there is almost no ideological pattern to the contests.         Representatives Justin Amash and Kerry Bentivolio of Michigan and Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee  all Tea Party lawmakers in good standing  are threatened by potential challengers backed by business groups and their more traditional Republican allies. Those challenges are not so much from the partys left but more from a new breed of candidates hoping to professionalize a House Republican caucus whose image has been battered by the turmoil in Washington.         Even the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee Representative Greg Walden of Oregon has drawn a credible challenger from the partys right Dennis Linthicum the chairman of the  Klamath County Board of Commissioners .         Somebody has to get serious about looking at spending the growth of government the regulatory aspects that discourage business and risk-taking said Mr. Linthicum who called Mr. Walden a statist who would prefer to keep government in the size shape and fashion in which it currently exists.         How such contests resolve themselves could leave the House Republican caucus either more uncompromisingly conservative in 2015 or more committed to governance and compromise.         Its an offshoot of the decline in competitive districts because of redistricting said David Wasserman a House analyst at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. There are fewer fights to pick with the other party so there are going to be more fights within your party.         In some sense the fight for the heart of the House Republican caucus began last Tuesday in Alabama when Bradley Byrne a business-backed former state senator fought off a Tea Party-supported firebrand to win a special House election in Mobile.         In Tennessee Mr. DesJarlais has maintained his Tea Party bona fides since the 2010 wave swept him into Congress. But the taint of scandal has followed him since divorce records exposed accusations of violent behavior as well as a telephone transcript indicating that as a practicing doctor he had an affair with a patient and encouraged her to get an abortion. Another former patient emerged last year to say that she too had had an affair with Mr. DesJarlais and had smoked marijuana with him.         The hits have kept coming since then and State Senator Jim Tracy is now considered the favorite in the primary fight in August.         In Michigan business-backed candidates are challenging Mr. Amash and Mr. Bentivolio two black sheep of the House Republican conference. Mr. Amash has electrified the libertarian wing of the Republican Party with his crusade against domestic spying his willingness to challenge his partys defense hawks and his opposition to even the most austere budget plans of his leadership which he invariably condemns as timid taps at the Big Government edifice.        
39,100000002541678,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Mystery of a 257-Year-Old Cannon Lingers,PAUL POST,902,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/nyregion/mystery-of-a-257-year-old-cannon-lingers.html,20,STILLWATER N.Y.  It sits now in its rightful home after a strange journey along the East Coast its whereabouts a mystery even as it passed through an amusement park various collectors hands and an art museum in Alabama.         And even with the item in question safely nestled at Saratoga National Historical Park here the question remains: How did a quarter-ton Revolutionary War cannon come to be so lost?         Details are vague even if the cannons provenance is not.         The cannon is one of only three known remaining six-pounders  artillery that fired six-pound cannon balls  used by the British general John Burgoynes army. It was surrendered to the American colonists after the Battles of Saratoga in 1777.         Despite its weight and historical significance the cannon somehow disappeared around 1961. No one seems to know for certain whether it was stolen misappropriated or simply forgotten. In any event it was gone and life went on.         With the cannon missing a substitute from the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center in Fremont Ohio was lent to the Saratoga historical park where the Battles of Saratoga were fought.         And then a conversation overheard by chance four years ago led to its eventual return.         Joseph Craig a ranger at the park heard a tourist from Alabama compare the borrowed cannon to one he had recently seen in Tuscaloosa Ala. Mr. Craig grew curious and an investigation began.         National Park Service law enforcement officials in Atlanta were dispatched to Alabama. They found the cannon in question at the Westervelt-Warner Museum of American Art in Tuscaloosa now called the Tuscaloosa Museum of Art.         Thats when a new battle began.         It was nice to know where it was but the Park Service couldnt go after it said Christine Valosin the Saratoga historical parks curator. We didnt have the legal right to say Give it back!Â          Ms. Valosin had to help establish that the cannon in Alabama was the one that had disappeared from the Saratoga park in 1961. She compiled 68 pages of data and diagrams including some from the British National Archives which proved the cannons authenticity.         It was cast near London in 1756 during the Seven Years War and transported to Canada in 1776. General Burgoynes goal in 1777 was to advance south to Albany and split the colonies in two and end the American rebellion.         By the time the general reached Saratoga on Sept. 19 he had 18 six-pounders while the Americans had no cannons at all. The bronze weapon nearly five feet long and weighing 555 pounds fired solid six-pound iron balls or even more lethal grapeshot which could deliver a withering blow to anything in its path. Six-pound cannons were prized because they could be moved more easily than heavy artillery but were still powerful enough to cause huge casualties.         This thing certainly killed American soldiers said Eric Schnitzer the historical parks ranger-historian. A body exhumed at Saratoga in the 1940s was found with grapeshot still embedded in it.         After General Burgoynes surrender Americans used the cannon for the remainder of the war; it was later moved to New York during the War of 1812 for coastal defense.         About 100 years ago it was put on display at Prospect Park in Brooklyn where the Battle of Long Island had been fought during the Revolutionary War.         In 1934 a local historian in Saratoga Thomas J. Hanrahan convinced the New York City parks department that it should be sent upstate for commemorative purposes. It eventually fell into the hands of Mr. Hanrahans successor William Snyder who kept it in a barn near Saratoga.         When Mr. Snyder died the cannon was moved again for safekeeping.         Not long after it was lost.         Investigators eventually retraced the cannons journey. They believe it went to Saratoga Springs first then to a small amusement center in nearby Gloversville then passed through collectors hands in Connecticut and Florida before arriving in Tuscaloosa in the mid-1970s. It stayed there until the Park Service learned of its whereabouts in 2009.         Following extensive negotiations the owners of the Tuscaloosa Museum of Art agreed to turn it over and it arrived at the Saratoga park on Aug. 29 of this year.         Christine and her group are the real archival heroes in this case said Robert Wittman the former head of the F.B.I.s Art Crimes Investigation Unit which specializes in stolen museum pieces and items of cultural importance. Shes the one that came up with all the documentation. Mr. Wittman assisted in the case as a private consultant.         A dedication originally planned for Oct. 5 was delayed by the federal governments shutdown and is now scheduled for Friday.         Though the cannon has been silent for two centuries its mere presence tells a timeless story about Americas origins and the human toll of war.         To me when I see the cannon I think of the fact that it was involved in a battle that cost the lives of many Americans as well as Englishmen French and Germans said Charles H. Cureton the director of Army museums at the United States Army Center of Military History in Washington. Its a connection with the past that you dont necessarily get from a book or seeing a picture. People who fought in the American Revolution touched this gun. Its a symbol of the sacrifice that those soldiers made in achieving American independence and the founding of this new nation.        
40,100000002545136,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,,Health Website Tests a Tycoon and Tinkerer,SHERYL GAY STOLBERG,1310,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/us/health-website-tests-a-tycoon-and-tinkerer.html,1,WASHINGTON  Jeffrey D. Zients a multimillionaire entrepreneur and management consultant joined the Obama White House in 2009 with a mandate to streamline the federal bureaucracy. A year later he issued a prescient warning.         The government largely has missed out on the information technology revolution Mr. Zients said in a 2010 internal memo. I.T. projects too often cost hundreds of millions of dollars more than they should take years longer than necessary to deploy and deliver technologies that are obsolete by the time they are completed he wrote.         These days Mr. Zients is witnessing that ineptitude up close as the emergency fix-it man charged with righting HealthCare.gov the bungled online marketplace for medical insurance. He is to become President Obamas  top economic adviser in January  but first he is leading the so-called tech surge to haul HealthCare.gov into the 21st century. Ignoring friends who told him not to get mixed up in the website fiasco Mr. Zients (pronounced ZYE-ents) promises it will run smoothly for the vast majority of users by the end of November  a schedule considered highly optimistic.         Mr. Obamas reputation and the electoral fortunes of Democrats could hinge on the work of Mr. Zients a man who has no hands-on technology experience  although he has advised health care companies on business practices. In the universe of experts who might have been called in for rescue work Democrats close to the administration say there were others perhaps more qualified than Mr. Zients but he was the best of those Mr. Obama and an insular White House were comfortable with.         In an interview Denis R. McDonough Mr. Obamas chief of staff called Mr. Zients a force multiplier who will deliver what he promises. He said the president had given Mr. Zients the same instructions he had given White House staff: Get this fixed.         Mr. Zients who will turn 47 on Tuesday made a fortune reported to be close to $200 million building two consultancies and taking them public. His wife Mary is from a prominent South African mining family  Nelson Mandela attended their wedding  and they live with their four children in Northwest Washington where an Aston Martin is in the garage. A onetime high school wrestler at the capitals elite St. Albans School he is often described as ultracompetitive.         Now he works without pay on a full-time trust me around-the-clock basis he told reporters in a conference call on Friday. Mr. Zients shuttles between a health care command center in suburban Herndon Va. the White House and an office near the coffee machines on the third floor of the hulking  Department of Health and Human Services  building here overseeing an effort that includes dozens of tech experts. They include Todd Park the White House chief technology officer who is under subpoena by House Republicans to testify at a hearing this week and Michael Dickerson an engineer on leave from Google who lists herding cats as a skill on his LinkedIn profile.         Administration officials say Mr. Zients who declined to be interviewed has intensified the pace at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services the agency responsible for the website. He began work on Oct. 21 the same day Mr. Obama declared that nobody is madder than me about the sites failures and quickly set about drafting a punch list of problems to fix. It is updated daily.         Among other immediate changes Mr. Zients recommended that the agency hire a general contractor to coordinate repairs started daily telephone news briefings and instituted at the command center morning and evening stand up meetings so named because each tech team member in a military-style exercise in accountability must stand while delivering a progress report.         Mr. Zients told reporters on Friday that the site was getting better each week but remains very slow and sporadic for many users. He said response times  how long users wait for a page to load  now average less than one second down from eight seconds. The error rate  how often system failures prevent users from advancing to the next page  is 2 percent down from 6 percent Mr. Zients said.         We have a lot of work ahead of us he said still promising that he would meet his Nov. 30 deadline.         Even his supporters remain skeptical. To try to come in in six weeks and sort something like this out  I just have a lot of sympathy for him said Joshua B. Bolten a friend of Mr. Zients and a chief of staff to President George W. Bush.        
41,100000002545286,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Film on Love and Gang War in Puerto Rico Is Coming to New York,MIREYA NAVARRO,925,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/nyregion/film-on-love-and-gang-war-in-puerto-rico-is-coming-to-new-york.html,23,On the sixth day of filming the housing projects managers decided to paint.         Soon the buildings of Residencial Luis LlorÃ©ns Torres  Puerto Ricos largest public project  were covered with white primer abruptly halting production of a film that had started shooting when the buildings were yellow and blue.         It was like a ghost city said Antonio Morales the films writer. We wasted $30000 in six days.         The episode was only one twist in the unlikely trajectory of   For Love in the Projects  which was inspired by Romeo and Juliet and is scheduled to be shown this week at three City University of New York colleges. The movie which has already been released commercially in Puerto Rico is set inside a complex with about 2600 units in 140 buildings  and a long history of drug gang clashes and raids by the National Guard. Residents play all but a few roles.         Mr. Morales 31 grew up in LlorÃ©ns with a drug-addicted mother and a father who ran a local cocaine operation. He originally wrote For Love which is in Spanish with English subtitles as a play after he founded a drama club for other children in the project. Government housing officials soon began funneling money to his theater group seeing its potential for spreading an antidrug message and for giving residents a chance to tell their own stories.         Hundreds of performances and a $1.2 million film later the film version of For Love in the Projects comes to New York. Faculty members at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan have invited officials from the New York City Housing Authority and from bar associations and law enforcement agencies to the first  screening  on Monday evening with the goal of discussing whether a similar youth theater effort could be established here. The film will also be shown at  Lehman College  and  Hostos  Community College.         It would engage peoples skills in film and theater to document life in public housing so that people understand what it is said Jodie G. Roure an associate professor at John Jay. People need to understand whats really going on.         Public housing residents in New York have an orchestra choral groups and performing arts programs but no youth-run theater Housing Authority officials said. Arts programs they added have to be financed by outside organizations because the agency cannot afford them.         For Love in the Projects however does have a fan high up in the Housing Authority hierarchy  Carlos Laboy-Diaz the executive vice-president for operations. As administrator of the agency overseeing public housing in Puerto Rico Mr. Laboy-Diaz approved money to renovate the theater at LlorÃ©ns to accommodate Mr. Moraless drama club in the early 2000s.         We had a young person with a great project he said. This is a success story.         The eldest of three brothers Mr. Morales spent part of his childhood in New Jersey before the family moved back to LlorÃ©ns when he was a fifth grader. He said he wrote comic book stories and pursued theater as a refuge from the relentless violence raging outside and his familys own turmoil. As he got older he grew aware of guns under mattresses and the packs of cocaine hidden stuffed inside drawers.         After he earned an audition to a performing arts high school in San Juan at 15 he started the drama club to share what he was learning to help keep other children away from the pervasive drug scene.         When he was 17 following the example of West Side Story he adapted Romeo and Juliet to the harsh reality of the project. Soon word spread about the play and he was receiving invitations from schools nonprofit organizations and other housing projects for performances. Those performances were accompanied by frank discussions in which he brought up the subject of narcotics trafficking which is entrenched in Puerto Rico  a convenient passageway for cocaine and other drugs from South America destined for the mainland United States.         In translating the play into film Mr. Morales has given outsiders glimpses of life in the forbidding LlorÃ©ns a self-contained enclave along the highway between San Juans airport and the major tourist districts. Hildamar Ortiz a senior adviser with the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development in San Juan said the stigma of living in one of Puerto Ricos 330 projects runs so deep that residents routinely give fake addresses when applying even for menial work.         Mr. Morales who now works full time in film production and with his theater group lives in Guaynabo near San Juan. He said that he and his two younger brothers were distributed among different relatives after the grandmother who helped raise them died from AIDS. Their father went to federal prison and their mother died while attending a drug rehabilitation program he said.         Mr. Morales shares an apartment with one of his brothers Xavier 25 a college student who played the Romeo-like character Angelo in the film. Juliet or Cristal was played by Anoushka Medina a LlorÃ©ns resident who attends the University of Puerto Rico.         So far housing officials in Puerto Rico have given $2.8 million for a tour of the play and the production of the film.         The projects drug-dealing crews allowed the director Luis Enrique Rodriguez to shoot the film undisturbed. Last January they asked Mr. Morales to help mediate a cease-fire.         The truce lasted until July when local newspapers reported a gunfight among four drug gangs that left one man dead.         Then the fragile peace resumed.         Its little by little Mr. Morales said.

I mean her. I mean him.                                     In this imported production from  Shakespeares Globe  of London deception is a source of radiant illumination for the audience while the bewilderment of the characters onstage floods us with pure tickling joy. I cant remember being so ridiculously happy for the entirety of a  Shakespeare  performance since  let me think  August 2002.                                     That was  the last time I saw the Globes Twelfth Night  (in London) directed by Tim Carroll and starring the astonishing Mark Rylance in a bar-raising performance as the Countess Olivia. And how thrilled I am that our wandering paths have crossed once more rather like those of the separated twins at the plays center.                                     This Twelfth Night  which opened on Sunday in repertory with a vibrant and shivery Richard III that allows Mr. Rylance to show hes as brilliant in trousers as he is in a dress  makes you think This is how Shakespeare was meant to be done. Thats appropriate since the mission of the 16-year-old Shakespeares Globe (where Mr. Rylance was the original artistic director) has been to recreate the experience provided by its namesake which existed back in the Elizabethan heyday of you-know-who.                                     So the costumes for both productions are of the period in which they were written. So is the live music. And all the roles are portrayed by male actors as they once were.                                     The congested Times Square theater district doesnt allow for the re-creation of the capacious roofless wooden O that is the Globe. But with artful lighting (by Stan Pressner) that makes sure the audience is never in the dark (literally as well as figuratively) these shows create a sense of open complicity between actors and theatergoers such as was said to exist five centuries ago. Theres seating onstage by the way. But whether youre up there or in the balcony youre never going to feel excluded unlike the unpopular Malvolio from Twelfth Night portrayed by the polymath Stephen Fry in a felicitous Broadway debut.                                     These productions are suffused with that most fundamental of Shakespearean virtues faith. The performers here trust wholly in Shakespeares words and in the ability of the audience to understand them. So many interpretations of the canon now are tricked out in the condescending high-concept garb of anachronistic settings with comedy that exaggerates the (yuck yuck) bawdy parts with broad illustrative gestures.                                     Mr. Carroll and Mr. Rylance are having none of that nor is any of the consistently excellent supporting cast. They let the language lead them to the characters. Because they know what theyre saying  and where what theyre saying comes from  we do too. And even if youre an inveterate bardolator you may find lines that you never fully grasped before making sense.                                     This is the more remarkable when you consider that both plays are about illusion. In Twelfth Night a young woman (Viola splendidly embodied by Samuel Barnett) dresses up as a boy to woo a woman by proxy for the man Viola secretly loves. In Richard III a fiendish politician (the title character portrayed by Mr. Rylance) hoodwinks a nation.                                     Of course theater is one big illusion. That reality or unreality is fully acknowledged by the actors being onstage donning their Elizabethan garb when we enter the theater. Yet somehow once the plays proper start we eagerly accept whats happening not as a substitute for reality but as a heightened truer version of it.                                     If Twelfth Night a celestial comedy and Richard III a grisly history play share a theme it is that in life disguise comes before a fall. All the characters are in some way not what they seem. And all are ultimately revealed to be what they really are which they themselves do not initially understand. Before the end pretty much everybody takes a tumble physically as well as metaphorically. The forms and consequences differ.         
43,100000002545207,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,football,Reining In Manning to Role of Game Manager,HARVEY ARATON,992,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/sports/football/reining-in-manning-to-role-of-game-manager.html,3,EAST RUTHERFORD N.J.  It was a moment frozen in poses of stunning failure coach and quarterback wearing now-familiar expressions of utter exasperation. Hands on hips  Tom Coughlin  stared at a hangdog-looking  Eli Manning  like a disbelieving father whose son has just backed the car out of the driveway and into a tree.         He let it go and didnt see the nickel Coughlin would say of a Manning pass that was intercepted by the Raiders Tracy Porter and returned 43 yards for a touchdown late in the first half Sunday at MetLife Stadium. But he was there.         Porter was there all right stepping into the passing lane as the ball flew in the direction of Victor Cruz. And then Porter was gone carrying Mannings 16th interception  and third for a pick-six  in a most trying season.         The Giants never-out all-in playoff hopes survived Mannings gaffe and generally mediocre play in a 24-20 victory over visiting Oakland. But we may have witnessed the end of Mannings carte blanche with the football  at least while the Giants remain in touch with their inner Houdini as they scramble to escape the 0-6 hole they dug to start the season.         Manning has already won Coughlin two Super Bowls and a possible place in the Hall of Fame. In Eli he still must trust. The question of how much  or how much less  might have been answered when the Giants got the ball after Porter scored trailing 17-14 with 1 minute 18 seconds left in the half.         Weve taken the ball in 41 seconds and driven it in the length of the field and Eli has been superior in that situation Coughlin said of Mannings well-documented reputation as one of his eras great closers.         Not this time though. On first down Manning was sacked for a 6-yard loss at the Giants 14-yard line. Coughlin called timeout. On second-and-12 Peyton Hillis rambled for 12 yards to the Giants 26. Now the clock ran along with the Giants who stayed on the ground allowing the half to expire on their 31 with two timeouts in the coachs pocket. Coughlin did not give Manning the opportunity to strike back and get lucky downfield.         So was it that swirling wind which seemed to make an adventure out of passing and kicking that made Coughlin play it safe?         I didnt think it was a major factor Coughlin said.         Give him credit. Coughlin is seldom one to turn an interview room into a spin room.         It was to regroup he said of his decision. I thought we had plenty of ways to go and not a lot of time so thats on me. It was my decision to get in there at halftime. And thank goodness it worked.         Left unsaid but surely implied was that another turnover would have been calamitous in a season of horrors that induced Coughlin the comic to ask while commenting on a Hillis fumble at the end of a screen play that cost the Giants 3 first-quarter points Is it Halloween every Sunday?         He does know the difference between bizarre and bad. So while he noted that Manning was facing pressure up the middle and from the corner on the Porter pick there was no excusing it. And Coughlin would be first to admit that the strategy to relieve Manning of more potential hurry-up heroics did not succeed because the quarterback calmed himself in the locker room.         On a day he completed 12 passes for 140 yards against a team that surrendered 406 yards and 7 touchdowns to Philadelphias Nick Foles the previous week Manning missed other open receivers including Cruz on third down from the Raiders 5 with 8:15 left in the game.         Instead of scoring a touchdown for an 8-point lead the Giants had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by Josh Brown that produced the 24-20 spread. The Raiders could not overcome it against a Giants defense that allowed just one sustained drive (for 3 third-quarter points).         Two players familiar with the searing pain of recurring injury and prolonged inactivity  defensive back Terrell Thomas and running back Andre Brown  saved Manning and maybe the season. Thomass third-quarter interception and runback of a Terrelle Pryor pass was the game-turner. Brown subsequently scored with one of the 115 yards he gained on a remarkable 30 carries in his first game back from a broken leg.         I carried it 30 times? Brown said. It felt like 50.         There is no guaranteed carry-over for the Giants except the likelihood of an emerging game plan. With their defense growing stout and a workable running game restored with the signing of Hillis and the return of Brown it may be in their best interest to have Manning manage games more than risk having him mangle them. Hasnt safer than sorry always been the Giants North Jersey modus operandi?         That is no easy call for Coughlin as trusting of Manning as he has been of anyone. Remember when he let Manning throw deep in Philadelphia last season and an offensive interference call took the Giants out of game-winning field-goal position?         It was too early in the season to know how much that call and defeat would cost the Giants. Now Coughlin knows that one misstep and the dream of the great comeback in all likelihood dies. It is not all Mannings fault that he has one of the leagues lowest quarterback ratings  shaky protection no productive tight end and a subpar Hakeem Nicks are part of it. But his play illustrated Sunday by the second-quarter pick has been underwhelming.         Asked if it was only a matter of time before the Old Eli reappeared Manning said Im worried about wins getting wins.         Fair enough. But it is Coughlins job to worry about the best way to get them. Until Manning makes better use of his side-view mirrors no more high-speed driving on the freeway.

44,100000002529798,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Talk of Penalty Is Missing in Ads for Health Care,ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS,1343,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/nyregion/talk-of-penalty-is-missing-in-ads-for-health-care.html,1,New Yorks health exchange slogan is  Todays the Day.  Minnesota has enlisted  Paul Bunyan . Oregon held a music contest and California stresses the peace of mind that will come with insurance.         The state and federal health insurance exchanges are using all manner of humor and happy talk to sell the  Affordable Care Acts  products. But the one part of the new system that they are not quick to trumpet is the financial penalty that Americans will face if they fail to buy insurance.         On state exchange websites mention of the penalty is typically tucked away under frequently asked questions if it appears at all. Television and print ads usually skip the issue and operators of exchange telephone banks are instructed to discuss it only if asked. The federal website now infamous for its glitches  mentions the penalty  but also calls it a fee or an Individual Shared Responsibility Payment.         The euphemisms and avoidance of any discussion of the penalty are no accident both supporters and critics of the law say. While the mandate for all Americans to buy health insurance  with a penalty if they do not  was the linchpin of the  Supreme Court decision  upholding the law and is considered the key to its success poll after poll has found that it is also the least popular part of the program.         State exchange operators say that they are not trying to hide the penalty but that their market research has taught them that at least in the initial phase consumers will be more receptive to soothing messages and appeals to their sense of collective responsibility than to threats of punishment.         We feel that the carrot is better than the stick said Larry Hicks a spokesman for  Covered California . This is a new endeavor. We want people to come in and test our wares.         But there is also the dirty little secret of the penalty: It is a bit of a chimera because the federal government cannot use its usual tools like fines liens or criminal prosecutions to punish people who do not pay it. The penalty is supposed to be reported and paid with the income tax returns of those who do not buy insurance but the government has not said how it will collect from those who owe it but do not pay it though the law allows it to deduct from any income tax refunds.         It might be that they want to be positive said  Michael Cannon  director of health policy studies at the conservative Cato Institute. But its also the case that an informed customer is not their best customer.         And for many healthy middle-class people a side-by-side comparison might suggest that it would be more cost-effective to pay the penalty than to buy insurance.         In 2014 a family with two adults and two or more children for example would pay $285 or 1 percent of the familys income over the $20300 filing threshold whichever is greater; those jump to $2085 or 2.5 percent by 2016 and rise with inflation after that.         For instance a family of four making $59000 a year could face a choice between a $387 penalty the first year or in a typical silver or midpriced policy offered on the California exchange a premium of nearly $4800 after the federal subsidy with a $4000 deductible according to the Kaiser Family Foundation  subsidy calculator . There is variation from plan to plan but the deductible typically would not apply to doctor visits preventive care lab tests or generic drugs although some regular co-payments would apply.         Are they going to buy it? said Robert Laszewski president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates a health care industry consultant in Alexandria Va. I dont mean this as an attack on Obamacare. I think its a difficult political problem.         The federal website which serves residents of 36 states appears to acknowledge this problem in a  not-quite-threatening way : If someone who can afford health insurance doesnt have coverage in 2014 they may have to pay a fee. They also have to pay for all of their health care.         The penalty despite its unpopularity is the glue that holds the Affordable Care Act together. Unless people are forced to buy insurance health policy experts say young and healthy people may stay away leaving only the more expensive patients in the plans which will quickly drive up premiums. And it was the penalty that the United States Supreme Court relied on to uphold the individual mandate reasoning that it was a legal use of Congresss taxing authority.         The sotto-voce treatment of the penalty resembles the strategy Massachusetts used when it set up its universal health insurance program several years ago. It took a sales approach at first using the Red Sox in its campaign to appeal to men who tend to be a little more resentful of being pushed into something said Jon Kingsdale the executive director for the first four years.         In November 2007 with barely two months left to sign up his state began emphasizing the penalty and volume soared he said. That was very effective as a call to action Mr. Kingsdale said.         Directors of state exchanges said that as happened in Massachusetts a new phase of advertising that incorporates the penalty may kick in as the sign-up deadline approaches. Last month the Obama administration said people who signed up for coverage by March 31 would avoid the penalty; previously the date was Feb. 15.                Also in T Magazine »       
45,100000002545177,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,football,"For the Want of Real Leaders, N.F.L. Culture Will Stay Lost",JULIET MACUR,1131,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/sports/football/for-the-want-of-real-leaders-nfl-culture-will-stay-lost.html,1,By now we know what Richie Incognito is accused of doing to his  Miami Dolphins  teammate Jonathan Martin. Name-calling. Bullying. Threats. What we dont know is the truth of what happened between them or who is going to fix the cruel locker room culture that the situation has exposed.         Well have time to ponder possible solutions when in an extreme case of bad luck for the  N.F.L.  the Dolphins play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday Night Football. That game will showcase the leagues two most dysfunctional teams.         The Bucs are winless. Their players are ready to mutiny against their unpopular coach Greg Schiano. Staph infections have swept through their locker room this season. Despite all that the Dolphins would probably give anything to trade places with the Bucs right now. After all there are proven remedies to the Bucs problems. Win a game. Replace the coach. Disinfect the locker room. Move on.         The Dolphins case is much more complicated.          Roger Goodell  the leagues commissioner has promised to get to the bottom of the Incognito-Martin situation. He hired what he called an independent investigator to learn the details to uncover who knew what and when and to find out how a player had come to feel so bullied that he left the team. Goodell would also want to know how it all could happen under the watch of coaches who often make it their business to know whats going on in the locker room.         Given the investigators findings Goodell should be able to create rules to prevent a similar situation from happening again. If bullying is found he should be aggressive about making changes if only to protect the leagues brand. But will he? And if he does when?         Look at this quotation from Goodell: We are changing the culture of our game for the better. Sounds good right? But he didnt say that last week or even in the last month. He said it in 2009 during  congressional hearings  as the league was being pummeled for its denials about football-related concussions. It took the N.F.L. years even to acknowledge that  head injuries  posed a serious problem for its sport and that was an issue dealing with life and death. So perhaps people should think twice about putting their trust in Goodell this time around in trying to fix this problem that upon first glance seems ingrained in the leagues culture.         Looking to Dolphins coaches probably wont help much either. They cant win here. Coach Joe Philbin should be blamed for encouraging aggressive behavior or turning a blind eye to it. If neither he nor his staff had any idea that Martin was feeling cornered by Incognito  which is a long shot since coaches often have spies within the team to monitor team chemistry  those coaches should be blamed for their ignorance.         And dont expect Stephen Ross the 73-year-old billionaire owner to change a thing to bring more professionalism to his teams locker room. Hes not around nearly as much as the owner Jerry Jones is with the Dallas Cowboys and look how well Jones has kept his team under control. Less than two months after a Cowboy died after a teammate drove drunk yet another Cowboy was charged with drunken driving early this year. So much for lessons learned.         Unfortunately there is only one sure way to rid a locker room of racial discrimination bullying extortion or whatever hazing-gone-bad the Dolphins may be guilty of  and that is to change the teams locker room culture from the inside out. That would mean the players have to get on board. And that includes those players who came to Incognitos defense. They called him a leader a funny guy whose actions were just part of a teams fabric.         But thats expected. Its what teams do even in the face of a teammates bad behavior. Teams stand as one bound by the same toughness and togetherness that Incognito was supposedly instilling in Martin. Teams tend to stay true to that code of brotherhood even if it taints their reputation or possibly hurts others.         Remember when Alex Rodriguez apologized in 2009 for doping? His Yankee teammates didnt speak up or urge Major League Baseball to punish him more severely. No they just sat stone-faced at Rodriguezs news conference and listened to an admitted cheat. Good guy Derek Jeter the longtime team captain was front and center in the audience to show his support even though Rodriguezs confession tainted him and every other player in the game. In baseball it was called having Rodriguezs back.         Email: juliet@nytimes.com        Also in Video »       
46,100000002545270,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,,Salvaging Obama,BILL KELLER,1769,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/opinion/keller-salvaging-obama.html,,President Obama is under water. His approval in the polls is low and sinking his signature initiative is staggering from a combination of incompetence and sabotage his foreign policy is a jumble. Congress is a Bermuda Triangle where the most elementary White House business disappears. The public is numbed and disgusted. Allies are theatrically furious about eavesdropping. Put it this way:         When the water-cooler buzz in Washington is focused on Obamas near-death experience in last years campaign debates its pretty clear he is not setting the agenda.         I have a few suggestions for how Obama might lift his presidency up from the bottom. The to-do list that follows consists of ideas that are worth doing on the merits  and  advantageous on the politics. Most of them are familiar because this is a time to revive the best features of a stalled presidency not to launch grand new initiatives. Its not that I want the president to think small; by all means address the threat of climate catastrophe and push ahead on early childhood education. But he needs to get a few wins on the scoreboard. I invite readers to post their own suggestions in the comments section.         The first job is obvious not least to the president. The bungling of the health care rollout was a humiliation for an administration whose campaign wizards famously tamed the social network in 2012. It has given Republicans license to feign indignation even as they do their best to undermine the new program. It has distracted the press from both the success stories (like Kentucky where the rollout worked the way it was supposed to) and the episodes of Republican mischief (like Georgia where the state blocked the hiring of navigators to help applicants through the enrollment process). I have no doubt that the administration will get the system working and that the program will ultimately prove popular. But the longer it takes the more the president squanders the already meager public confidence that he can do  anything  right.         If after a few more weeks the assembled experts are still struggling to make the website work maybe its time to redeploy some techies from the National Security Agency.         Which brings me to...          Fire James Clapper.   Dismissing Clapper the director of national intelligence is not a new idea. Fred Kaplan of Slate suggested it in June after Clapper lied to Congress about the N.S.A.s data-mining. George Shultz the former secretary state who belongs on any list of great living statesmen called for it in September. (I dont know how the guy whos in charge of national intelligence Clapper is still there Shultz told a World Affairs Council audience. He lied!) Better late than never. Obama should fire him not just because he lied but also because Clapper has cast himself as the defender of the status quo the apologist for excess. He seems to think what our government does is none of our business.         The president should draft someone widely viewed as tough-minded clear-thinking and credible. Id bring back Robert Gates who having run both the Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency has the stature and the technical chops and has shown he can run a gigantic enterprise without becoming a captive of it.         With a change of leadership should come systemic reform to make the spy agencies more accountable. Of the various options Ive read my favorite is Max Frankels idea of creating a specialized court with the expertise to watch over the intelligence agencies and enough transparency to inspire public confidence. The president should make that idea his own.          Double down on immigration reform.    Comprehensive immigration reform is both the right thing to do and a winning issue politically. A good bipartisan bill has passed the Senate with enhanced border security a more sensible legal immigration regimen safeguards against employers who cheat and legalization for many of the 11 million who live in the shadows. This sensible reform is trapped in the House by the crossfire within the Republican Party between those who would like to put out a welcome mat for Hispanic voters and those including the former profile in courage Marco Rubio who are cowed by the wrath of their base.         Its conceivable that some House Republicans will take heart from the experience of New Jerseys governor Chris Christie who embraced humane reforms and won half of the Hispanic vote in his re-election landslide last Tuesday.         But even if the chances of success are small the more the White House presses the issue the more it isolates the ideologues from the pragmatists and the more it separates the right wing from business donors.         As Paul Taylor who follows immigration for Pew Research puts it: Its better politics if the president wins but its still good politics if he loses.          Rebalance foreign policy.   For years the administration has talked of rebalancing our military strategy to address an increasingly assertive China. The Pentagon liberated from Iraq and drawing down in Afghanistan has taken some modest steps in this direction deploying more of the Navy to Asia devoting more resources to Chinas space and cyber threats. But our rivalry with China is not and should never be primarily military. We need to compete on the fields of economics and diplomacy. Unfortunately the civilian custodians of our foreign policy have been bogged down in the Middle East a region that matters a lot but not as much as it did when we were more dependent on imported oil.

47,100000002541116,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Latino Comedian Returns to Where It All Began,DAVID GONZALEZ,775,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/nyregion/latino-comedian-returns-to-where-it-all-began.html,22,The bodega cat knew trouble was brewing in the Torres Family Deli-Grocery as it slunk past the bags of plantain chips and boxes of Goya crackers. Sure enough two men lunged at each other grunting and grabbing as they fell to the scuffed tile floor near the glassed-in counter.         Whats going on? shouted  Mike Robles . Stop it!         The two stopped got up and pounced on Mr. Robles giving him the bums rush as they heaved him into the canned goods aisle.         Mr. Robles could not have been happier. He was in on the joke. Actually he wrote the joke. The wrestlers were part of a comedy skit he had set up inside the Bronx bodega just south of Fordham Road where a series of stand-up comics were doing routines by the deli counter. It was a sweet return to the neighborhood where he first honed his comedic skills 16 years ago for Comedy Rhumba on public-access cable.         A lot has changed for him since then: He makes a living as a comic hosting shows at clubs and theaters around the country. Other things have not changed: Despite having had short-run shows on broadcast channels catering to young Latinos he does not see television doing enough to embrace that rapidly growing group. Forget about mainstream shows like  Saturday Night Live which has been criticized  for its shortage of Latino performers. Instead Mr. Robles makes his own breaks like bringing wrestlers and stand-up comedy to a bodega.         We have to create our own stuff he said. I think Latino-owned television has failed us more than mainstream television. They have all these outlets but what happened? I cant cry to Saturday Night Live because if I was Lorne Michaels Id say Before you come crying to me look at the Latino networks. That would shut me up.         Not that he is easily silenced. Mr. Robles had left his job as an airline customer service representative to become a comic showing up in the late 1990s at the offices of BronxNet  the boroughs public-access station  clutching a piece of paper with a few notes for a guerrilla comedy show. Michael Max Knobbe the stations director liked the idea so much that he teamed with Mr. Robles to interview unsuspecting passers-by on Fordham Road and at Orchard Beach. In other skits they played pranks on unwitting victims.         He noted that he was ahead of his time pranking celebrities before MTVs Punkd or confounding clueless people on the street before Jay Leno. Some of his early subjects like Spanish speakers getting in trouble for not speaking English have gone from the realm of comedy to reality in recent years.         Mr. Robles decided this year to stage a reunion show that would be shown in December and he enlisted Mr. Knobbe to once again prowl Fordham Road. The days question was: What do you think of the governments proposal that parents must pass an I.Q. test before having children?         If they pass no problem. But if you fail Mr. Robles explained you either have to pay for all of the childs expenses or give them up for adoption to a gay couple because everyone knows gay people are smarter than straight people.         He walked up to strangers microphone in hand. In some cases they waved him off before he had a chance to say anything. One man just shook his head as he explained his sudden case of camera shyness.         Ive got warrants he said. I cant.         Mr. Robles approached Will Crowell a street vendor.         There are not enough gay people for all those kids Mr. Crowell said. You got to educate yourself.         It was harder to fool some people who recognized him. He also found that this time around fewer people spoke English on Fordham Road. But others jumped at the chance to talk with him like one man who was handing out fliers and wanted to talk about how his daughter was excelling in science class.         You talk to somebody enough and theyll say whats bothering them Mr. Robles later said. You become like their therapist.         For Mr. Robles it felt good to be back on the streets of the Bronx since his comedy shows keep him away in Texas and California for much of the year. The borough has plenty of memories for him as well as lots of people with opinions to spare. Not to mention bodegas where anything can happen.         I wish I had 12 wrestlers in there he said. That would have been crazy. But Ill start with two. Maybe next time well have ultimate fighters coming down the fire escape into the bodega.                Also in Video »       
48,100000002544883,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,media,Vox Media Buying Curbed.com Network of Sites,LESLIE KAUFMAN,399,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/media/vox-media-buying-curbedcom-network-of-sites.html,5,Vox Media a company with three strong digital brands including the technology site The Verge is adding to its portfolio. The company plans to announce on Monday that it is buying  Curbed.com  L.L.C. which runs three web publications that deliver in-depth neighborhood coverage with attitude of real estate dining and retailing.         Both companies are privately held and Vox did not disclose the purchase price; however a person with knowledge of the deal said it sold for a mix of stock and cash for $20 million to $30 million.         The purchase comes just as Vox has raised $34 million in new investment capital. Silicon Valley firms have been wary of big investments in digital media companies that focus on content but Vox has joined BuzzFeed as a notable exception to this rule.         In a phone interview Jim Bankoff Voxs chief executive said that the time was right for expansion and that the Curbed brands were a smart addition because they coveted the same kind of reader.         Both Vox and Curbed value storytelling and as a result have attracted the otherwise hard to reach young affluent social consumers Mr. Bankoff said. We think this combined expanded platform will clearly attract premium advertisers.         Vox has earned a reputation for high-quality content producing sleekly photographed articles that integrate multimedia in a smooth and sophisticated manner. The company based in Washington attracts 41 million unique users from the United States each month according to Quantcast which specializes in digital audience measurement.         In addition to The Verge Vox runs Polygon a gaming site and SBNation a network of 300 sports sites that mix reporting and analysis with lots of fan interaction. SBNation Voxs largest brand has already been expanding globally by putting extra focus on sports like soccer.         The Curbed sites are also good-looking but have a much smaller readership according to Quantcast with about 5.1 million unique monthly domestic viewers. However Curbed which started in New York has been expanding rapidly to include neighborhood coverage of cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco.         In addition to a site of the same name that covers real estate Curbed.com L.L.C. runs Eater which covers restaurants and Racked which covers retailing.  Lockhart Steele  who founded Curbed will stay on and work out of Voxs offices in New York. When the merger is complete Mr. Bankoff said Vox will have roughly 140 people in journalism and video positions.

50,100000002545188,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,hockey,Border War Brewing for the Olympics,JERÃ LONGMAN,967,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/sports/hockey/border-war-brewing-for-the-olympics.html,1,LAKE PLACID N.Y.  Kacey Bellamy and Courtney Birchard were hockey teammates and close friends at the University of New Hampshire. The friendship endures Bellamy said but we definitely know our boundaries. Were not afraid to mix it up with each other on the ice absolutely.         Bellamy plays for the United States and Birchard for Canada in a rivalry that will be unsurpassed in intensity and expectation in February at the Olympics in Sochi Russia. One team or the other has won every Olympic gold medal and world championship awarded in womens hockey.         Right now the rivalry keeps our sport alive Gillian Apps a Canadian forward said.         Respect also comes with an edginess that led to a rare brawl last month after an American forward violated a cardinal rule and skated into Canadas goaltender.         We really dont like each other Bellamy an American defenseman said. Im going to throw it out there.         Womens hockey prohibits body checking and has established its distinctiveness with speed stick handling fluidity and finesse. Smaller players retain a chance to excel. But as players have grown bigger faster and stronger more fit and competitive a hybrid game has evolved that increasingly embraces muscular assertiveness.         Players are continually pushing the limits of permissible contact.         We send a message to the world to prove that yeah we can hit American forward Lyndsey Fry said. Were not going to go out there and open-ice hit someone; thats not allowed. But we can throw our bodies around. We can get really gritty in the corners. When somebody throws me into the boards a little bit its not cheap play. Its hockey.         Refereeing though has remained inconsistent. The boundaries of allowable hitting seem to vary from game to game. And unlike other levels of hockey the international womens game is policed by only one referee and two linesmen instead of two referees and two linesmen.         We have it at every other level but womens international hockey said Katey Stone of Harvard who coaches the United States Olympic team. I dont understand that.         A second referee is being considered for the 2018 Olympics Stone said. One concern of international hockey officials is that the pool of available referees is too shallow.         I dont know Stone said. Theres a lot at stake and theres a lot that gets missed.         Thats human error she said. Its everywhere. Its not going to be fair. The key for us is weve got to keep making our success happen.         In rehearsal for Sochi the United States and Canada will play seven times and then at least once at the Olympics. So far Canada the defending Olympic champion has a 3-0 edge in these warm-ups including a 4-2 victory last week here at the Four Nations Cup.         I think to some degree we give them more respect than we would like at times and then it swirls into a game of hesitation for us Stone said.         The Canadians have employed a calculated physicality to temper the American speed quickness and pressure. Jayna Hefford a Canadian forward seeking to play in her fifth Olympics said: They have a lot of skilled players. We certainly dont want to let them do whatever they want with the puck.         Canada plays on the fringe of acceptability realizing that the referees will not whistle every transgression hesitant to unduly impede the flow of the game Stone said. After last weeks defeat which was tense but not fistic Stone called Canadas physical style over the edge and out of the scope of the rules in my opinion.         The Americans are not exactly shy and retiring said Birchard a Canadian defenseman.         Each game we play them they do something dirty she said.         The teams scuffled before the 2010 Vancouver Olympics and again at an exhibition last month in Burlington Vt. after the American forward Monique Lamoureux collided with Canadian goalie Shannon Szabados in the crease.         Lamoureux said she did not see Szabados until it was too late to avoid her.         When I saw her fall in the corner of my eye I kind of expected what came after Lamoureux said.          Birchard charged Lamoureux and threw her to the ice.   She took a head shot to the goalie Birchard said. It was pretty unnecessary. I figured it was enough and tried to handle it. Womens hockey is definitely about speed puck handling scoring nice goals but I mean if theres a cheap shot to a player or a goalie and its continuous every time we play them how else do you handle it?         Lamoureuxs twin Jocelyne intervened and then others on the ice paired off.         The fists are starting to fly said a webcast announcer. Weve got bedlam here.         In truth this bore little resemblance to an N.H.L. fight where enforcers drop their gloves and square off. For one thing women wear full-face shields or cages on their helmets. There was some grappling and punching but the brawl quickly dissipated. Both sides chalked it up to necessary protection of their teammates.         Im sure if we were all on the same team we would all be friends Birchard said.         Hayley Wickenheiser a longtime Canadian star said at the time It was kind of fun to see and it brought a lot of intensity to another dogfight with these guys.         Tessa Bonhomme a Canadian defenseman told a Canadian television interviewer about an old saying that the best team-bonding is a bar fight.

The idea is to demolish outdated buildings and erect modern office buildings to compete with London or Singapore. New York could use more top-flight office space but  the proposal  to rezone 73 blocks in East Midtown needs work.         In our view the City Council has two choices: refashion the proposal before it votes on it this week or reject it and wait for the next mayors input. Here are the main issues that need addressing:          TRANSIT BOTTLENECKS:  The subway platforms converging beneath the terminal are perilously crowded even now. The Bloomberg administration  has promised  a $100 million bond up front to help the Metropolitan Transportation Authority deal with bigger crowds and the plan calls for new entryways and more spacious platforms.         Even so the council must be absolutely certain that these are addressed because higher buildings will inevitably add many new commuters to an already overstressed system. The M.T.A. has estimated that $465 million is needed for basic improvements to deal with 80000 additional people coming into the area after the completion of the new Long Island Rail Road spur.      AIR RIGHTS:  Critics say the proposal greatly undervalues the air rights that smaller buildings or nonprofits like churches can sell so that developers can build taller buildings than would otherwise be permissible. The city has said that these rights should be sold at $250 a square foot. Critics say market rates negotiated in private bargaining would produce more revenue that could then be applied to public purposes like improved mass transit.           PUBLIC SPACES:  The latest proposal presented by Deputy Mayor Robert Steel is full of intriguing ideas about improving public spaces in the rezoned area where the new skyscrapers would be built  a more parklike Park Avenue for example and a pedestrian walkway adjacent to the terminals. These ideas however worthy could also need more public vetting.           PRESERVATION:  Much of the existing neighborhood while aging is serviceable built to human scale and containing elegant older buildings including the Graybar Building and the Yale Club to name only two. It is not clear at the moment exactly how they can be protected from developers eager to move skyward as quickly as possible.         Mr. Bloombergs administrators say they are working hard to address these complaints. If they can do that fine but there is no need to meet an artificial deadline.

With that in mind the Brennan Center for Justice recommends that New York and other states with outdated election schedules provide for a two-week voting period instead of cramming it all into one day. At least 32 states and the District of Columbia offer some form of early voting and apparently voters like it a lot. As one former Nevada election official told the Brennan Center analysts Early voters are happy voters and Election Day voters are grumpy voters.         The centers survey found that early voting also means shorter lines better performance by poll workers and more time to fix broken machines or other problems.         Not all lawmakers are eager to expand their electorate. When Barack Obama ran for president in 2008 minority voters in Florida took advantage of the states early voting and flocked to the polls. Many cast their ballots on Sunday after church  Souls to the Polls as Floridians called it. But shortly before the 2012 election Floridas Republican legislators cut the number of days and hours almost in half. The long lines that resulted on Election Day finally shamed the Legislature into allowing local election officials to add extra days in future elections.         Many of the states that have encouraged early voting are in the West and South. The laggards are in the Northeast with New York now the largest state without any early in-person voting. New Yorks Assembly passed an early-voting bill this year but it stalled in the State Senate. New Jerseys Legislature also passed an early-voting bill; Gov. Chris Christie  vetoed  it.         It is well past time for lawmakers in New York New Jersey Connecticut and other states with antiquated one-day voting to make this essential civic duty a lot easier to meet than it is now.

What had looked like another dynamic performance  and a get-well card to their recuperating coach  devolved into a victory that raised questions along with the ghosts of last January about whether the Broncos are built to endure in the playoffs and what kind of shape quarterback Peyton Manning will be when they get there.         The Broncos squandered most of a commanding lead and watched Manning after being battered by the Chargers hobble off the field on already gimpy ankles. He will have a magnetic resonance imaging test Monday.         Even a late stand by the defense and the offenses running out the clock could not be fully enjoyed. Sandwiched in between the Broncos had to survive Trindon Hollidays fumbling a punt inside Denvers 20-yard line.         It surely made for some uneasy viewing for Fox who had planned to watch the game at his off-season home in Charlotte N.C. He is expected to be gone from the team for as long as 10 weeks. Earlier Sunday Fox sent texts to many of the players and on Saturday he spoke with Manning before the team left Denver.         I told him not to be yelling at me during the game Manning said. Its not good for his blood pressure.         The absence of Fox who was awarded a game ball comes at a critical time for the Broncos (8-1). They had breezed through the first half of their schedule with only two games closer than 16 points  a loss to Indianapolis and a comeback win over Dallas. But after the victory over the Chargers (4-5) the Broncos have two games with unbeaten Kansas City their division rival and make a trip to New England.         The next three weeks should go a long way in determining who wins the A.F.C. West and who has home-field advantage through the playoffs.         What kind of shape Manning will be in is an open question.         The bye last week had given his two sprained ankles a chance to recover but he was sacked twice and hit four other times Sunday. The final one came late in the game when Manning delivered a perfectly timed second-and-7 pass to Demaryius Thomas for 9 yards that effectively ended the Chargers hopes.         But Manning was tackled around the ankles by defensive end Cory Liuget. There were lumps in many throats  from the Broncos sideline all the way to Charlotte.         Its the worst when your quarterback goes down your leader said Thomas who caught two touchdown passes. It scared me a little bit.         If Manning emerged sore it did not damage his sense of humor. He said 4.4 or 4.5 it wont make much of a difference referring to a 40-yard dash time far faster than he would run. Asked if he expects the ankle problems to linger Manning said: I hope not. Id like to be able to shake it. Its felt good these last few weeks but obviously weve got a lot of football left.         And many tests.         While the culture of an N.F.L. locker room has become a national news story out of Miami locker room leadership is being tested in Denver and Houston where the head coaches Fox and Gary Kubiak have taken leaves for health reasons. With their absences more responsibility falls not only on the interim coaches but also on the teams veteran leaders.         Fox was playing golf nine days ago near his home in Charlotte during the Broncos bye week when he experienced dizziness. Two days later he had surgery to replace a heart valve. He was released from the hospital Friday.         Standing in for Fox is Jack Del Rio who in nine years as Jacksonvilles coach had to face Manning twice each season. While Del Rio the defensive coordinator now has to oversee the entire team there was probably little to weigh in on with an offense that is on pace to set N.F.L. records for scoring and total offense.         But he did speak up when the defense forced a punt that Holliday fumbled and recovered at his 19-yard line. Del Rio told the offensive coordinator Adam Gase to do whatever he needed to win the game. That meant putting the ball in Mannings hands  something that Fox and the former offensive coordinator Mike McCoy now the Charger coach did not do in their overtime playoff loss to Baltimore last season.         Manning finished 25 of 36 for 330 yards and 4 touchdowns and he eclipsed 3000 yards and 30 touchdowns in a season for the eighth time one behind the record-holder Brett Favre. But the defense struggled to get off the field allowing San Diego to hold the ball for more than 38 minutes. The offense did not score over the final 26 minutes and Manning lost a fumble that jump-started a Chargers comeback. That the Broncos 28 points was a season low was quite a feat given that they have a 37-year-old quarterback who is one year removed from missing a season after neck surgery.         There are many teams that would trade their troubles for the Broncos but if these problems are not solved in the coming weeks their coach may have company on the couch.

Instead she appeared in front of the newsmagazines trademark black backdrop and issued an apology.         Ms. Logan said that Dylan Davies one of the main sources for a two-week-old piece about the attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi Libya had misled the programs staff when he gave an account of rushing to the compound the night the attack took place. It was a mistake to include him in our report. For that we are very sorry Ms. Logan said.         The apology lasted only 90 seconds and revealed nothing new about why  CBS  had trusted Mr. Davies who appeared on the program under the pseudonym Morgan Jones. Off-camera CBS executives were left to wonder how viewers would react to the exceptionally rare correction.         While veteran television journalists spent the weekend debating whether the now-discredited Benghazi report would cause long-term damage to the esteemed newsmagazines brand some media critics joined the liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America in calling for CBS to initiate an independent investigation of missteps in the reporting process.         But the CBS News chairman Jeff Fager who is also the executive producer of 60 Minutes has not ordered an investigation and on Sunday a spokesman indicated that the program was going to let its televised apology be its last word on the issue.         However the apology was  deemed inadequate by a wide range of commentators  on Sunday night. Craig Silverman of the correction blog Regret the Error predicted that it would not take the heat off CBS News.         Aside from the fact that it struck a very passive tone and pushed the responsibility onto the source Dylan Davies it said nothing about how the show failed to properly vet the story of an admitted liar Mr. Silverman said in an email. There are basic questions left unanswered about how the program checked out what Davies told them and where this process failed.         In the short term this will confirm the worst suspicions of people who dont trust CBS News said Paul Friedman CBSs executive vice president for news until 2011. In the long term a lot will depend on how tough and transparent CBS can be in finding out how this happened  especially when there were not the kind of tight deadline pressures that sometimes result in errors.         Ms. Logan has said that a year of reporting informed the Oct. 27 piece which was Mr. Daviess first interview. Some of Ms. Logans conclusions still hold up to scrutiny  for example that contrary to the White Houses public statements which were still being made a full week later its now well established that the Americans were attacked by Al Qaeda in a well-planned assault.         But enough doubts have been sown about Mr. Davies account of being an eyewitness that CBS apologized on Friday scrubbed the report from its site (and the 60 Minutes Twitter feed) and prepared Ms. Logans on-camera statement Sunday. (Mr. Daviess account included him hitting an Al Qaeda fighter in the face with the butt of a rifle and seeing the dead ambassador J. Christopher Stevens at a hospital.)         Parallels have been drawn between this case and CBSs  flawed 2004 report  on President George W. Bushs time in the National Guard. Each time the news division adopted a defensive crouch when advocates first started to question the stories. But the political backdrop has changed significantly this time. In 2004 there were accusations of liberal bias and unrelenting coverage of the controversy on conservative websites driven by the rights long animus toward Dan Rather the correspondent on the Bush report and the implication that he was trying to hurt the presidents re-election chances.         This time conservatives initially trumpeted the 60 Minutes report: the morning after it was broadcast Senator Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina said on Fox News that he planned to block all administration nominations until Congress was granted access to all of the survivors of the attack. (On Sunday Mr. Graham stood by his threat despite CBSs retraction.) At the same time questions about Mr. Davies and his account were immediately raised by both liberal activists and independent reporters.         Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 11 2013 Because of an editing error an earlier version of this article misidentified the person who said In the short term this will confirm the worst suspicions of people who dont trust CBS News. The comment was by Paul Friedman a former CBS executive  not by Craig Silverman of the blog Regret the Error.

The work of the commission has been stymied for months thanks to a standoff engineered by obstinate Republicans.         Voters confused by all the dark-money campaign manipulation triggered by the Supreme Courts Citizens United decision deserve relief. The arrival of the two new commissioners could help. They are Ann Ravel a Democrat known for strong enforcement of Californias cutting-edge campaign laws and Lee Goodman a Republican considered one of the capitals more knowledgeable campaign finance lawyers. Both are promising a fresh outlook and the hope that the commission will face up to its most basic responsibilities.         The six-member panel split evenly between the parties is supposed to serve as a vigorous campaign referee but politicians exploit its inertia. Its worst failure has been its inability to write new campaign regulations to require full disclosure of contributions by deep-pocketed corporate and union donors as envisioned by the Citizens United ruling. The Supreme Court said in that case that disclosure would allow citizens to see whether elected officials are in the pocket of so-called moneyed interests.         The in-the-pocket risk of corruption grows as the dark-money machines become even more aggressive. Secret money totaled more than $1 billion last year with a greater torrent already building for the next election cycle. Voters need to be able to track scheming donors. And that can happen only if the new commissioners can bring the agency back to life.         Meet The New York Timess Editorial Board Â»        Also in T Magazine »       
56,100000002545219,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,media,"Same Time, Same Channel? TV Woos Kids Who Can’t Wait",BRIAN STELTER,1126,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/media/same-time-same-channel-tv-woos-kids-who-cant-wait.html,1,When Eric Nelsons 6-year-old daughter Charlotte and 10-year-old son Asa discover that they cannot rewind or fast-forward a TV show they are perplexed  and their father is too. It is hard to explain the limitations of live television to children who have grown up in an on-demand world.         They say live TV the way I say doing my taxes  with resignation said Mr. Nelson a literary agent in Manhattan.         Charlotte and Asa like many children perceive all of television to be more  Netflix  than Nickelodeon: on demand and on their schedule not the networks. Their expectations  that every episode of every show is available anytime  give a glimpse into the future of entertainment and are already shaping the decisions of media executives who are their grandparents ages.         Netflix  Amazon  and other streaming video services are competing ferociously for childrens programming. And networks that cater to children are starting to show programs online before they appear on old-fashioned television.         Kids today dont know a world where they had to wait for a program said Tara Sorensen the head of original programming at Amazon Studios.         As Ms. Sorensens title indicates Amazon and rivals are commissioning shows including they hope the next big hits for children while bidding handsomely for rights to repeats of shows like SpongeBob SquarePants.         But stalwarts like Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel are not yielding ground. They are promoting new phone and tablet apps that give cable and satellite subscribers streamlined access to programs. Disney for example is planning on showing the first nine episodes of Sheriff Callies Wild West online this month several months before showing the program on the Disney Channel. New business models are being tried all the time: Sesame Street while still available free over the public airwaves can now also be seen for $4 a month on YouTube.         Children like Charlotte Nelson  who likes to turn on the Nintendo Wii U and watch movies on Netflix when she wakes up  are hot commodities they just are not old enough to know it.         Disney Netflix and other companies are being driven in part by studies that show children  at least those in middle- and upper-class families  are gravitating toward tablets and phones and away from the big-screen television. A study by Common Sense Media released in October found that the average amount of time children spend using mobile devices has tripled since 2011 from five minutes a day to 15. The average time spent in front of the TV is still much greater  about 75 minutes a day  but the group said it was down substantially from 2011. Children are increasingly choosing a personal (and malleable) touch screen over a TV.         Disney and others also are influenced by the fact that children are natural binge viewers but with a twist. When children are enamored of a show (or more specifically a character) they want to watch the same episode over and over and learn every detail. Instead of binge viewing as their parents do they dÃ©jÃ  view.         Certainly this repetitive behavior has been observed by researchers at least since the invention of the childrens book  everyone can remember a cherished book that was read and reread. But the streaming services and video-on-demand systems powered by cable providers make it easier than ever. There are fewer chances to stumble upon a broadcast episode of Cartoon Networks Adventure Time and certainly no rewinding of a VHS tape. And tantrums about a lost DVD have been superseded by tears when a Wi-Fi connection fails.         According to Amazon 65 percent of the most-replayed programs on its streaming service Prime Instant Video are shows for children. Within the Amazon Kindles subscription service for children ages 3 to 8 called FreeTime Unlimited nearly half of all video views are second- third- or fourth-time views.         For younger children re-watching involves learning  shows for preschoolers are the ones re-watched most by families that subscribe to Netflix. For older children it involves enjoying the humor in specific episodes.        
57,100000002545142,0,Article,Editorial,Opinion,opinion,,High and Low Premiums in Health Care,THE EDITORIAL BOARD,517,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/opinion/high-and-low-premiums-in-health-care.html,24,The debate over the effect the Affordable Care Act will have on individuals and families who buy their own policies has mostly been waged in anecdotes. Supporters of the law point to grateful individuals who were previously unable to get insurance or paid exorbitant premiums but found affordable coverage on the new health insurance exchanges. Critics counter with frustrated people who liked their old policies but will now be forced to buy a more comprehensive policy and pay a higher premium for it.         As it turns out there are estimates of how many people might fall into one category or the other. Up to seven million people may be able to get health policies without paying any premium at all. Some four million people may have to pay more for new (and better) policies not all of whom will necessarily be upset at getting better coverage at a competitive rate.         As Reed Abelson and Katie Thomas  reported in The Times  last week three independent estimates by Wall Street analysts found that five million to seven million people will qualify for federal subsidies that will exceed the cost of the cheapest plans for individuals and families on the exchanges. Neither the Obama administration nor the insurance companies however are promoting the plans vigorously. They believe that many consumers would be better off paying a bit more for a policy that would cover more of the out-of-pocket costs for a doctors visit or hospital stay.         In the wake of the federal website problems theres worry about whether the administration can reach its goal of enrolling seven million uninsured Americans in 2014. Surely the five million to seven million eligible for zero-premium policies would be an easy sell. About half of them are under age 39 and uninsured the kind of young people the exchanges need to broaden the risk pools. Health officials should pull out all the stops to identify and enroll them.         There is no official estimate of how many higher-income earners who have been buying individual policies would pay more when forced to buy new policies. Jonathan Gruber a health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who played a role in shaping the Affordable Care Act estimates 12 million people are currently covered by policies bought on the individual market. He says that after factoring in subsidies on the exchanges perhaps eight million will be covered by less costly policies next year and four million will be covered by more expensive policies which often provide richer benefits.         Individuals facing higher premiums are understandably distressed. But there is no getting around the fact that health reform changes the status quo  including requiring insurance companies to provide essential health benefits that were not previously covered and to take on people who were rejected before because of their health.         Those who will pay more should take comfort in the knowledge that should they lose their jobs or face financial hardships or a medical crisis their previous policies would not have adequately covered they would benefit from a health care safety net that offers federal subsidies and comprehensive coverage.

58,100000002545179,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Conservative Republicans Recoil at the Notion That Christie Is the Party’s Savior,JONATHAN MARTIN,1240,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/nyregion/conservative-republicans-recoil-at-the-notion-that-christie-is-the-partys-savior.html,16,Time magazine splashed  Chris Christie s profile on its latest cover. High-profile Republicans including the only female Hispanic governor in the nation are urging him to run for president. MSNBCs Morning Joe program seems to be anointing him the savior of the  Republican Party .         Everyone it seems is celebrating the ascent of Mr. Christie the governor of New Jersey. Except people like Scott Hofstra.         Were so frustrated with all this Christie talk we cant see straight said Mr. Hofstra who is active in the  Tea Party movement  and lives in Vine Grove Ky. He and his friends were especially furious when the governor on television last week described himself as a conservative given his recent expansion of  Medicaid  under the Affordable Care Act among other positions.         Hes no more conservative than Harry Reid Mr. Hofstra said referring to the Senate majority leader a Democrat.         Mr. Christies landslide victory in New Jersey was just days ago but the conversation about him is moving swiftly beyond the borders of his state. Three years before the presidential election a governor who was almost a complete unknown until he became a YouTube sensation in 2010 has become not only a political celebrity but also a deeply polarizing force within his party.         To many in the conservative movement Mr. Christie represents the kind of candidate the Republican establishment has foisted on the base in recent presidential elections  a media darling whose calling card is that elusive quality of electability and whose adherence to the partys principles is suspect.         The more the news media and the establishment cheer on Mr. Christie the more grass-roots activists  especially members of the Tea Party  resent it. Mr. Christie appeared this weekend on four of the Sunday morning talk shows. Chuck Henderson a Tea Party activist from Manhattan Kan. nearly shouted into the phone when asked by a reporter about the idea of Mr. Christie as a presidential candidate.         He won his re-election bully for him but for him to make the jump up the next rung of the ladder well hes not going to find any support from the people I mix with Mr. Henderson said.         A national poll conducted in September by Quinnipiac University underscored the pattern: While 46 percent of self-described moderates have a positive view of Mr. Christie and only 15 percent have a negative view among conservatives 33 percent view him favorably and 25 percent have an unfavorable impression.         Those around Mr. Christie are aware of the unease among conservatives and are beginning to emphasize his positions on issues like abortion  he is opposed to it except in cases of rape incest and the life of the mother  and state spending to try to blunt those concerns.         The governors standing among conservatives is important because Iowa and South Carolina two of the first three states in the Republican presidential nominating contest are dominated by ideology-driven activists. In addition grass-roots activists are providing much of the passion and energy for the Republican party right now.         In an interview last week Mr. Christie said if conservatives had questions about his principles they ought to examine his record.         Watch me govern he said. Ive cut taxes cut spending reformed pensions and benefits. Believe me if Washington were able to do that theyd have a parade for them. My record is my record. Im proud of it. And it is a conservative record governing as a conservative in a blue state.         But Mr. Christies record can be read a number of ways. Some conservatives have already raised questions about his actions on gun control: He vetoed several bills last summer including one that would ban the .50-caliber Barrett rifle but has approved others such as a measure that requires the police to provide the state with more information about guns used in crimes. And while he has made known his opposition to  same-sex marriage  he abandoned an appeal of a court decision that legalized it in his state. During his re-election campaign he also suggested he may support providing in-state tuition to illegal immigrants.         With a civil war underway inside the Republican Party what conservatives fear most is that Mr. Christies nomination would effectively mean that the party establishment had won the internal struggle  and that Mr. Christies force of personality trumped ideas.         Asked in an interview whether Mr. Christie could unite the partys factions Newt Gingrich the former House speaker responded flatly: No. I dont think Chris Christie has any interest in bridging that divide because hell run as an aggressive Northeastern moderate who can get something done. I dont see him using conservative language. He might be able to get nominated but it will be running as a personality leader not a movement leader.                Also in T Magazine »       
59,100000002545133,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,,The Plot Against France,PAUL KRUGMAN,793,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/opinion/krugman-the-plot-against-france.html,25,On Friday Standard & Poors the bond-rating agency  downgraded France . The move made headlines with many reports suggesting that France is in crisis. But markets yawned: French borrowing costs which are near  historic lows   barely budged .         So whats going on here? The answer is that S.& P.s action needs to be seen in the context of the broader politics of fiscal austerity. And I do mean politics not economics. For the plot against France  Im being a bit tongue in cheek here but there really are a lot of people trying to bad-mouth the place  is one clear demonstration that in Europe as in America fiscal scolds dont really care about deficits. Instead theyre using debt fears to advance an ideological agenda. And France which refuses to play along has become the target of incessant negative propaganda.         Let me give you an idea of what were talking about. A year ago the magazine The Economist  declared  France the time bomb at the heart of Europe with problems that could dwarf those of Greece Spain Portugal and Italy. In January 2013 CNN Moneys senior editor-at-large declared France in free fall a nation heading toward an economic Bastille. Similar sentiments can be found all over economic newsletters.         Given such rhetoric one comes to French data expecting to see the worst. What you find instead is a country experiencing economic difficulties  who isnt?  but in general performing as well as or better than most of its neighbors with the admittedly big exception of Germany. Recent French growth has been sluggish but much better than that of say the Netherlands which is  still rated AAA . According to standard estimates French workers were actually a bit more productive than their German counterparts a dozen years ago  and guess what they still are.         Meanwhile  French fiscal prospects  look distinctly nonalarming. The budget deficit has fallen sharply since 2010 and the International Monetary Fund expects the ratio of debt to G.D.P. to be roughly stable over the next five years.         What about the longer-run burden of an aging population? This is a problem in France as it is in all wealthy nations. But France has a higher birthrate than most of Europe  in part because of government programs that encourage births and ease the lives of working mothers  so that its demographic projections are much better than those of its neighbors Germany included. Meanwhile Frances remarkable health care system which delivers high quality at low cost is going to be a big fiscal advantage looking forward.         By the numbers then its hard to see why France deserves any particular opprobrium. So again whats going on?         Heres a clue: Two months ago Olli Rehn Europes commissioner for economic and monetary affairs  and one of the prime movers behind harsh austerity policies  dismissed Frances seemingly exemplary fiscal policy. Why? Because it was based on tax increases rather than spending cuts  and tax hikes he  declared  would destroy growth and handicap the creation of jobs.         In other words never mind what I said about fiscal discipline youre supposed to be dismantling the safety net.         S.& P.s  explanation  of its downgrade though less clearly stated amounted to the same thing: France was being downgraded because the French governments current approach to budgetary and structural reforms to taxation as well as to product services and labor markets is unlikely to substantially raise Frances medium-term growth prospects. Again never mind the budget numbers where are the tax cuts and deregulation?         You might think that Mr. Rehn and S.& P. were basing their demands on solid evidence that spending cuts are in fact better for the economy than tax increases. But they werent. In fact research at the I.M.F. suggests that when youre trying to reduce deficits in a recession the opposite is true: temporary tax hikes do  much less damage  than spending cuts.         Oh and when people start talking about the wonders of structural reform take it with a large heaping of salt. Its mainly a code phrase for deregulation  and the evidence on the virtues of deregulation is decidedly mixed. Remember Ireland received high praise for its structural reforms in the 1990s and 2000s; in 2006 George Osborne now Britains chancellor of the Exchequer called it a shining example. How did that turn out?         If all this sounds familiar to American readers it should. U.S. fiscal scolds turn out almost invariably to be much more interested in slashing Medicare and Social Security than they are in actually cutting deficits. Europes austerians are now revealing themselves to be pretty much the same. France has committed the unforgivable sin of being fiscally responsible without inflicting pain on the poor and unlucky. And it must be punished.                Also in Video »

The killing was the first reported assassination of a senior national official in  Iran  in years though there has been a recent wave of attacks on local officials and others.         The minister Safdar Rahmat Abadi was shot in the head and chest as he got into his car at about 7:50 p.m. the news agency reported citing witnesses. It quoted a police official saying that the shots appeared to come from inside the car and that spent shell casings were found there. There was no sign of struggle at the scene of the killing the police official was quoted as saying.         Another state-affiliated news agency ISNA reported that a special homicide investigator and criminal prosecutor were at the scene but that no arrests had been made so far.         There was no indication in the reports of a specific motive for the killing or of any claim of responsibility.         When an Iranian prosecutor was killed in Sistan and Baluchestan Province last week Sunni Islamists claimed responsibility saying they had acted in revenge for the hanging of 16 prisoners by judiciary officials. Those hangings in turn were carried out as a reprisal for an attack by the Jaish ul-Adl group of Sunni Islamist militants in which 14 border guards were killed.         Since 2007 five Iranian nuclear scientists have reportedly been assassinated; most recently in January 2012 one was killed by a car bomb. Authorities in Tehran the capital have accused Israel and its Western allies of being behind those killings; the United States has denied any role and Israel has not commented.         On Oct. 3 the powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guards organization said it was investigating the shooting death of a Guards officer Mojtaba Ahmadi in what it called a horrific incident. It denied news reports that the death was an assassination. Mr. Ahmadi was found in late September near Karaj a town northwest of Tehran according to Alborz an Iranian news website.        
61,100000002545165,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Many Black New Yorkers Are Seeing de Blasio’s Victory as Their Own,MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM,1257,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/nyregion/many-black-new-yorkers-are-seeing-de-blasios-victory-as-their-own.html,1,A black janitor in Brooklyn almost shouted out the name when asked about his vote in the mayoral race. Bill de Blasio he said knows my struggle.         In the Bronx some African-American voters defaulted to a shorthand: the man with the black wife. Nobody thought it necessary to explain whom they meant.         And in a Brooklyn housing project a lifelong resident said he was tired of mayors who in his mind had pitted blacks against whites. Mr. de Blasio he declared is black and white.         Of all the records shattered by Mr. de Blasios landslide victory perhaps the most remarkable is that virtually every vote cast by black New Yorkers  96 percent  went his way. He captured a bigger portion of the black vote than David N. Dinkins in 1989 when he was elected New York Citys first black mayor with 91 percent of the black vote according to exit polls.         After the divisive tenor of the Giuliani years and the deep grievances engendered by the stop-and-frisk police tactics of the Bloomberg era black New Yorkers are now claiming Mr. de Blasios victory as their own. In postelection interviews dozens of black New Yorkers said that Mr. de Blasios personal touch his biracial family and his pledge to help the working-class and poor had affected them deeply. His victory they said was a chance to gain a voice in City Hall after two decades of leadership they viewed as inattentive distant and at times even callous.         There was a sense of not being included not being cared about said Charlene Curry as she walked along Marcy Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn last week. She said she had never met Mr. de Blasio but felt as if he were a neighbor. The mayor-elect she said has a more humane approach a more inclusive approach. She added That reaches home.         The excitement about Mr. de Blasio  tinged in some quarters by a dose of wait-and-see skepticism  was diligently cultivated by the candidate. Mr. de Blasio who is of Italian and German heritage kept up a brisk schedule of visits to predominantly black churches frequently spoke of the effect of stop-and-frisk tactics on young black men and put his wife and children at the forefront of his campaign making a celebrity of his son Dante who sports a large Afro.         But it was also a result of Mr. de Blasios comfort and fluency with black culture borne of an interracial marriage and personal experience that offered a credibility voters said could not be bought by consultants or simulated in sound bites.         A protÃ©gÃ© of Bill Lynch an African-American political operative and a veteran of the Dinkins administration and the congressional campaign of Charles B. Rangel Mr. de Blasio is steeped in the history of New Yorks black politics.         A close friend Bertha Lewis recalled first meeting Mr. de Blasio in the late 1990s when the future mayor was a federal housing administrator assigned to work with poor and working-class New Yorkers struggling to afford their homes.         Ms. Lewis was skeptical  government officials in her experience were not good listeners  but was impressed to see Mr. de Blasios intuitive ease while speaking with a group of older black women at a forum.         A woman would say Do you understand young man? And Bill said Yes maamÂ  Ms. Lewis recalled. Do you know what that little tiny cultural thing meant?         That adroitness was frequently apparent on this years campaign trail where Mr. de Blasio received electric receptions when visiting traditionally black neighborhoods like Harlem and Crown Heights.         With his self-assured mien and casual tendency to call people brother Mr. de Blasio often seemed to play the political preacher even at run-of-the-mill news conferences. At a rally in late October in Brooklyn he opened his remarks by intoning Brothers and sisters we are gathered again earning appreciative nods and murmurs from supporters.

62,100000002545146,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,media,Marrying Companies and Content,DAVID CARR,1254,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/media/marrying-companies-and-content.html,1,On Thursday Contently a hot little company held a buzzy conference at the Bowery Hotel on a very of-the-moment topic.         The conference the Brand Publishing Summit included clients agencies and publishers with a lot of chatter about brands going direct to the consumer and cutting out the middle man. (Which come to think of it would be people like me but lets not dwell on that.)         But as Tomas Kellner managing editor of GE Reports a publication put out by General Electric reminded people the trend of the moment has been around for a long time. In 1947 General Electric had an in-house reporter telling the companys stories  a guy named  Kurt Vonnegut .         The founders of Contently like that anecdote a lot. Three young men  Joe Coleman Dave Goldberg and Shane Snow  started the company in 2010 after the rise and crash of so-called content farms. They believed there was room for a company that enabled high-quality stories told on behalf of commercial clients what is now known as  branded content .         Over the years this content has had  an unsavory reputation   most have been infomercials masquerading as editorial content. But the bar has been raised by companies like Red Bull whose incredibly popular extreme sports videos almost make it seem like a media company that sells beverages on the side.         Contently which grew out of the TechStars incubator program in New York developed a roster of writers and journalists for hire and a software application that helps companies tell their own stories as well. Three years later the company has raised $2.3 million in financing developed a roster of 27000 writers grown to 24 employees and has 40 Fortune 500 companies among its clients. Some of its customers include American Express Anheuser-Busch and PepsiCo.         When you walk into the Contently office in SoHo as I did on Tuesday you cant help noticing the large slogan on the wall: Those who tell the stories rule the world. Theres a wall of books as well  the company gave employees $20 each and turned them loose at the Strand bookstore  and another wall with photos of famous writers including Oscar Wilde Philip K. Dick and Hunter S. Thompson. The company also produces a print magazine called Contently Quarterly.         A cynic might suggest the furnishings are just a way to drape a cravenly commercial enterprise in the trappings of literature  akin to a Williamsburg hipster in a fedora  but part of the companys mission is to help people who type for a living actually make a living at it.         Mr. Snow the chief creative officer is a graduate of the Columbia Journalism School and a writer for Wired and Fast Company magazines among others. He suggested that in the thriving mix of custom-sponsored content there was one way to stick out.         We decided to plant a flag on quality get good writers to buy in and make sure they are paid well Mr. Snow said. We wanted to be the anticontent farm.         Now Contently is helping companies produce articles that appear on their own websites are used in native ad placements and are spread through social media  in essence helping their clients compete in a cluttered media environment.         Scott Roen vice president of American Express Open a small-business network used Contently to produce high-end coverage about its online forums.         By working with them you get access to a network of really good writers but they also help manage the work and integrate it into what we do Mr. Roen said. Weve learned a lot about publishing from working with them.         Sitting with Mr. Coleman the chief executive of Contently and Sam Slaughter the vice president for content in a conference room decorated with tiny robots Mr. Snow said that when he attended Columbia the most persistent question was building a sustainable business model for journalism.         It was clear with the fragmentation of traditional media we were in a kind of freelance revolution and it was also clear that brands wanted to connect directly with their audience he said.         About the same time Mr. Coleman who has known Mr. Snow since their days in middle school in Idaho Falls Idaho was working on a start-up he founded in Las Vegas called CashCrate. He needed some high-quality content. I could find you a developer in Russia pretty easily but I had no idea where to go to find a good writer he said.         He called Mr. Snow an idea was born and Mr. Goldberg built a platform for story-telling  for both clients and writers. At a time when advertising is achieving diminishing returns and public relations has trouble breaking through companies are learning the value of putting their names around  but not in the middle  of memorable stories.

63,100000002545144,0,Article,News,World,world,americas,Venezuelan Soldiers Deployed to Stores,WILLIAM NEUMAN,496,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/world/americas/venezuelan-soldiers-deployed-to-stores.html,8,CARACAS Venezuela  The Christmas shopping season has started with a jolt here with the socialist Venezuelan government dispatching soldiers to occupy a major chain of electronic goods stores ordering prices slashed there and in other shops that it has accused of price gouging.         Huge crowds formed outside stores in several cities over the weekend as inflation-weary Venezuelans showed up hoping for bargains. Others took the governments order as a license to loot: Some posted cellphone videos online showing large-screen televisions and other items being carted off in Valencia the countrys third-largest city.         The dramatic measures ordered on Friday by President NicolÃ¡s Maduro were reminiscent of the populist gestures of his immediate predecessor Hugo ChÃ¡vez the countrys longtime leader  who died in March .         They come as the government grapples with serious economic problems including inflation of 54 percent a year and shortages of many basic goods including toilet paper milk and flour.         All of that is weighing on Mr. Maduro a month ahead of municipal elections that the opposition is seeking to cast as a referendum on his young government. Mr. Maduro argues that his government is facing an economic war waged by what he calls the right-wing opposition in  Venezuela  and its backers in Colombia and the United States.         In announcing that military personnel would occupy the five-store electronics chain Daka Mr. Maduro said that the government would supervise sales at significantly lower prices and that the stores stock would be liquidated.         Let nothing remain on the shelves! he said during a television broadcast.         Mr. Maduro also dispatched officials to inspect other stores around the country saying they too would be forced to charge what the government considers fair prices.         Officials said over the weekend that several store managers had been arrested and would face charges of setting overly high prices. Luisa Ortega the national prosecutor said that some people had also been arrested and accused of looting.         Vice President Jorge Arreaza who is married to one of Mr. ChÃ¡vezs daughters said on Twitter on Sunday that the campaign against what the government calls speculators would continue forcefully. We will protect the PEOPLE against bourgeois parasitism he wrote echoing language often used by Mr. Maduro.         Henrique Capriles Radonski the opposition leader whom Mr. Maduro narrowly beat in an election to replace Mr. ChÃ¡vez in April criticized the measures on his Twitter account writing Maduro in desperation over his failure and inability to lead the country takes measures that do not solve the economic crisis.         The crowds forming outside stores over the weekend included both government loyalists and opponents. What they shared was a growing frustration with the countrys economic malaise and prices that keep soaring fostering anger with both the government and merchants.         The main government television station on Sunday repeatedly showed video clips in which Hebert GarcÃ­a the head of the recently created Supreme Organ for the Popular Defense of the Economy and other officials vowed to keep up the pressure on so-called speculators.        
64,100000002543435,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,,New Hope for Homeless Vets,LARRY OAKS,658,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/opinion/new-hope-for-homeless-vets.html,,Each Veterans Day we lament the number of men and women who have ably served in uniform but find themselves lost broken and homeless once out of it. Their stories are tragic and seemingly endless. For all the well-intentioned talk about meeting the needs of homeless veterans it remains a slow and difficult process that sometimes fails.         So it may come as a surprise that homelessness is on the decline among veterans a change brought about in large part by a significant public-private effort to build affordable housing that provides social services focused on military veterans. The country went from having 76000 veterans being homeless in January 2009 to fewer than 63000 in January 2012.         That progress doesnt make this work any less urgent. Thousands of veterans still struggling on the streets are much more likely to be chronically homeless than those who have already found help. Many of them have significant problems related to poor health mental illness substance abuse and dislocation from their former lives. Meeting their needs presents a stiff challenge and it means we need to accelerate our efforts at a time when federal support for these investments is in jeopardy.         Specifically we need more places like Valley Brook Village. Opened last month the $15.2 million development sits on the campus of a Department of Veterans Affairs medical center in Lyons N.J. offering affordable apartments and on-site social services to 61 homeless veterans who would not otherwise have access to such support.         It isnt owned or operated by the department  or any other branch of government. It was built by a private developer and is run by a local veterans services nonprofit financed by a mix of private capital philanthropic contributions and federal money.         Why did the Valley Brook Village effort flourish when so many others stalled? The groups that made it happen were able to take advantage of a federal program that frees up V.A. property for the construction of veterans housing. Valley Brook Village is the first project completed under the so-called enhanced-use lease policy which eliminates one of the highest barriers to developing projects like these: acquiring land.         The effort also was able to avoid heavy debt that could compromise its ability to stay up and running. It tapped federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits to attract $8.4 million in private capital from MetLife through the Local Initiatives Support Corporation a nonprofit community development organization where I work and its affiliate the National Equity Fund. And it benefited from both a V.A. capital grant and a program known as HUD-Vash  a joint effort by the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development that provides homeless veterans with affordable housing case management job training and other services to help them reclaim their independence.         Can Valley Brook Village be duplicated? Yes we know it can be. There is no lack of will to move swiftly on new projects and a list of success stories around the country helps identify best practices. But in Washington programs like the housing credit and HUD-Vash are at serious risk as Congress considers budget cuts and changes to the tax code. Our veterans will suffer if those programs are whittled down or lost.         Collaborative partners also make all the difference. Housing for homeless veterans is a particularly complex niche of real estate development. Its critical to have people onboard to help bridge the myriad parties involved. Thats what my organization does in addition to providing financing. We bring these lessons and proven models to Washington to help policy makers devise more responsive effective programs. Over the last decade weve helped create nearly 2000 affordable housing units for veterans.         Certainly there is no fast track to meet the needs of our most vulnerable veterans. But there is a blueprint. And with it we can move forward so that one day none of the men and women who have served our country find themselves without a home.         Larry Oaks is the vice president for housing for the Local Initiatives Support Corporation a nonprofit organization that helps local groups revitalize low-income neighborhoods.

65,100000002543281,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,,The Vets We Reject and Ignore,PHILLIP CARTER,745,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/opinion/the-vets-we-reject-and-ignore.html,25,TODAY we honor the nations 22 million  veterans  including more than 2.5 million who served in Iraq Afghanistan and other fronts in the war against Al Qaeda. But we are turning our backs on hundreds of thousands of veterans who were discharged under conditions other than honorable and so do not qualify as veterans under federal law.         Their discharges which include overly broad categories encompassing everything from administrative discharges for minor misconduct to dishonorable discharges following a court-martial nevertheless make them ineligible for the health care employment housing and education benefits offered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.         Because of the bad paper they carry in the form of their discharge certificates many of these veterans struggle upon leaving the military. And when they falter the burden for supporting them falls heavily on their local communities because federal agencies cannot by law help them.         No federal agency publishes the numbers of bad paper discharges. But historical studies suggest that at least several hundred thousand veterans fall into this category. Approximately  260000  of the 8.7 million Vietnam-era veterans were pushed out of the service with bad paper. More recently according to documents separately obtained by the  Colorado Springs Gazette  the Army discharged 76165 soldiers between 2006 and 2012 with bad paper. Of these recent Army discharges only one in seven were kicked out following a criminal conviction for a serious offense. The rest were discharged for smaller breaches of military discipline like missing duty or abusing alcohol or drugs. For many of them their misconduct was likely related to the stresses of war.         Instead of showing compassion for these troops who were carrying the invisible wounds of war their commanders kicked them out. These troops getting pushed out under such circumstances would be enough of a blow but these commanders compounded the injury by giving them bad paper instead of merely administratively separating them from the service.         While assessing the needs of veterans in the Western United States my research team met with community leaders and nonprofit agency staff members in seven cities with the largest populations of veterans and interviewed others in outlying cities and rural areas as well. Across these communities veterans with bad paper were believed to be significantly overrepresented in the at-risk veterans populations. All too frequently these veterans become part of the nations chronically homeless or incarcerated populations.         When they end up in distress or on the streets their communities must bear this burden alone.         We have a moral obligation to those who serve especially those who serve us in combat. At times the military must discharge those who cant perform or conform. However commanders should exercise far greater discretion and compassion in trimming the ranks. Bad discharges indelibly mark veterans as damaged goods and cost society a great deal too.         Congress should also allow the V.A. to more broadly provide mental health care homelessness support and other forms of crisis intervention to veterans with bad paper. The V.A. has case-by-case authority to do so now but that does not help veterans with bad paper who have acute needs. A more compassionate policy would not diminish the militarys ability to maintain discipline nor would it cheapen the valor of those who have served honorably.         The military has a process to fix bad paper but that process takes too much time and veterans often need legal help to prevail in an incredibly bureaucratic and difficult process.         The  story  of John Shepherd Jr. who earned a Bronze Star for valor in Vietnam but was kicked out after disobeying an order to return to combat after developing severe post-traumatic stress disorder shows how difficult these cases can be. Mr. Shepherd went without V.A. support for 40 years until a team of students and lawyers at Yale Law School helped him  correct  his record this month.         Excellent programs exist to help veterans in such cases but they deserve more resources. Small investments in pro bono legal services can help unlock a lifetime of access to the V.A. and help the neediest veterans with bad paper move on with their lives.         Finally the veterans community should do more to lift up those veterans who have been discharged with bad paper particularly in those cases where combat experience lies at the heart of the bad discharge. The American military ethos calls on all of us to leave no fallen comrade behind. That applies at home too and to all veterans regardless of whether they carry bad paper.

66,100000002545164,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,ncaabasketball,"N.C.A.A. Dodges a Bullet, but Change Is on the Way",GREG BISHOP,923,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-dodges-a-bullet-but-change-is-on-the-way.html,2,On Friday after United States District Judge Claudia Wilken made her latest ruling in OBannon v. the  N.C.A.A.  two men involved in the matter spoke with each other by telephone. One was Ed OBannon a former U.C.L.A. basketball star; the other Sonny Vaccaro the sneaker marketing executive turned perpetual N.C.A.A. antagonist.         Vaccaro felt more optimistic than disappointed about the 24-page ruling. But he also felt torn about his feelings and the outcome.         Wilken had certified the lawsuit as class-action but with a significant catch. She ruled that current and former Football Bowl Subdivision and Division I mens basketball players can challenge N.C.A.A. restrictions on athlete compensation.         Should they win should they receive even a slice of licensing deals or television revenue it would change the model for college athletics. It would strike down the long-faulty notion of big-time college sports as an amateur endeavor. Perhaps someone would finally banish the term student-athlete.         But Wilken certified a class for the purposes of injunctive relief only which would prevent the N.C.A.A. from acting in the same way in the future but not for damages. Wilken said the plaintiffs had not identified a legitmate method to calculate damages to former players.         That left OBannon and about 20 current or former athletes many of whom Vaccaro helped to join the case without what they desired in the first place: compensation for their likenesses and images after their playing career ended. If their case makes history they are unlikely to profit from it.         This is what I wanted Vaccaro said OBannon told him. Theyll have rights. I never had rights. I didnt think I would ever have rights.         Both sides naturally claimed victory last week. The N.C.A.A. in a statement said the ruling validated its argument that the case was wrong on facts and law. Its statement ignored the other half of the ruling the half the other side celebrated as a win.         The organization undoubtedly avoided potential damages to former players that could have escalated into billions of dollars even as the very real threat to the system that governs college sports remains. Vaccaro held onto that throughout the weekend.         He cares deeply about this case as much as anyone involved. He watched Baylor batter Oklahoma Stanford upset Oregon and Alabama steamroll Louisiana State.         Again he thought about how much money those games generated and how little of it went to the players. He disagreed with the N.C.A.A. on what Fridays ruling meant.         He thought about OBannon who had spied a college basketball video game at a friends house and thought he saw himself  same U.C.L.A. uniform same build same facial features. At first it flattered him and then it bothered him and then he became the face for much more than a likeness lawsuit. He became the face for whether college athletes should be paid and Fridays ruling a setback for him personally is the first step for that to happen.         OBannon and those guys won in the sense were going forward Vaccaro said. Those damages whatever they would have been if we win going forward theres no limit to what the numbers are in the future. This is not going to be like the N.F.L. settling the concussion lawsuit where they dont owe anybody after that.         The N.C.A.A. needs to change; even the organization agrees on that even if it does not want football and mens basketball players to receive additional compensation  cash the N.C.A.A. mostly pockets.         So many recent events have built toward change from botched enforcement investigations to the dozens of athletic directors who met recently to lobby for more of a voice in college sports.         The sanctions the N.C.A.A. levied recently against Miami  mainly accepting the universitys self-imposed postseason ban of two seasons and lost scholarships  were indicative of an organization with diminished power. The Committee on Infractions basically confirmed what Yahoo Sports wrote two years ago when it spoke to the booster Nevin Shapiro in jail and published a list of transgressions he detailed including cash payments to players and parties on yachts. It even found an absence of institutional control.         Yet where the N.C.A.A. clobbered Penn State it gave Miami a slap on the wrist.         Weeks before Fridays ruling the video game manufacturer EA Sports and Collegiate Licensing Company settled with the OBannon plaintiffs for about $40 million. That left the N.C.A.A. on an island  its approval rating as low as ever and its president Mark Emmert favoring reform but hamstrung by so many universities with so many missions an ineffective governance structure and a rule book bigger than the  Harry Potter  series.         The OBannon case scared athletic departments because of the implications. It should scare them. And it should change how major college sports work.         Players deserve more of a voice additional compensation or not and they are starting to speak up. As with the All Players United slogan written on gear across the country. Or when Grambling football players refused to play a game because of the unacceptable conditions at their facility.         Vaccaro watched the events at Grambling with great interest. That neither the university nor the N.C.A.A. penalized or publicly admonished the players spoke volumes Vaccaro said about the power those players exhibited.         This is where were headed he said. Going forward is where the billions are. I want to live to see that day in court. I want to see that for Ed OBannon. The people he and those guys helped wont even know they helped them. But change is coming.        
67,100000002544539,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,,Saving Kerry's Peace Plan,YOSSI BEILIN,686,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/opinion/saving-kerrys-peace-plan.html,,Tel Aviv  Ive witnessed decades of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and can attest that the current round of talks is at grave risk of failure. Secretary of State  John Kerry s eighth visit to the region last week was his worst. He found himself in an open confrontation with  Israel s prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  and in a TV interview he showed his disappointment.         Two relatively new issues are now being raised which were not central to discussions when we signed the Oslo Accords 20 years ago. One is the Israeli governments demand that the  Palestinians  recognize Israel as the home of the Jewish people and the other is the challenge of evacuating settlers given the expansion of the settler population and the fear that evictions will lead to violent confrontations between settlers and Israeli security forces.         If these problems are resolved there is a much greater chance of reaching an agreement mainly due the American governments newfound interest in ending this longstanding conflict.         Until recently I was among those trying to convince Israeli decision makers to give up on the demand that Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state both because Israel has been and will continue to be a Jewish state without Palestinian recognition and because Israel never made such demands when signing peace treaties with other neighbors like Egypt and Jordan.         Ive changed my mind. I believe Israeli leaders will be willing to pay a high price in exchange for such recognition and therefore a deal is possible that solves both the settler evacuation problem and Israels desire to be recognized as a Jewish State.         Israeli leaders worry that if Palestinians refuse to recognize Israel as a Jewish state they will continue to claim entitlement to the right of return for refugees which could flood Israel with non-Jews making Jews a minority in their state. The Palestinians insist on a resolution to the refugee problem before granting any such recognition.         Both sides should embrace the formula proposed 10 years ago by the Geneva Initiative which recognized the right of both parties to statehood and Palestine and Israel as the homelands of their respective peoples.         If Palestinians accept this formulation then Israel would have to agree to absorb a limited number of Palestinians and allow those Israeli settlers who wish to stay in the West Bank to live under a sovereign Palestinian state  provided that they agree to live as Israeli citizens with permanent residency in Palestine and accept that settlements cannot be exclusively for Israelis.         But first the Israeli government needs an incentive to convince as many settlers as possible to leave the future Palestinian state and will allow some Palestinians to live in Israel.         Heres how it could be achieved. Five years after the signing of an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement all settlers remaining in the newly established Palestinian state would be counted and the resulting number would set the quota for the number of Palestinian citizens admitted for permanent residency in Israel.         This solution would create an incentive for the Israeli government to minimize the number of settlers who remain outside of Israeli sovereignty because fewer settlers in Palestine would mean fewer new Palestinians allowed to live in Israel. For the Palestinians it would be a step toward solving the refugee problem.         It wont be easy for Mr. Netanyahu but its less difficult for him than confronting and evacuating settlers. The  Palestinian Authority  leader Mahmoud Abbas could clarify that allowing Palestinians to live in Israel as permanent residents doesnt in any way equate them with the Israeli settlers; its a way to let some Palestinians live where their ancestors did.         Hard-liners on both sides will oppose this move as will those who hope America will allow them to continue wading through the swamp of conflict for many bloody years to come. But vastly reducing the population of settlers and letting the resulting number determine how many Palestinians are allowed to return to Israel would be a major step toward resolving two thorny issues preventing a peace deal.         
68,100000002544682,0,Article,News,World,world,asia,"Danger Persists for Reporters in Pakistan, Despite Vow to Protect Them",SALMAN MASOOD,1084,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/world/asia/danger-persists-for-reporters-in-pakistan-despite-vow-to-protect-them.html,10,ISLAMABAD Pakistan  The killers were waiting for Ayub Khattak a small-town reporter in northwestern Pakistan as he returned to his house one evening in October. They gunned him down just outside his door.         Mr. Khattak who worked for a small local paper and Jang Pakistans biggest news daily died instantly. His assailants sped away on a motorbike unmolested. And across the rest of Pakistan small protests by journalists quickly fizzled out.         In Pakistan one of the worlds most dangerous countries for journalists the death of a reporter sometimes barely makes the news. And despite promises by a new government in recent months that protecting journalists is vital the problem has continued and even intensified.         So far this year five journalists have been killed on the job; another 44 have been killed in the past decade according to the  Committee to Protect Journalists  a lobbying group based in New York. And the effect beyond just the deadly cases is both wide and deep: Countless other reporters in Pakistan have been kidnapped beaten or otherwise intimidated because of their work.         Part of the problem is that the attackers come from every side. It is not just insurgents and criminals who are targeting reporters but also most chillingly operatives from Pakistans civilian and military intelligence agencies. Human rights groups say the security services have a long record of violence and impunity and that has continued unabated.         Things are getting worse said Bob Dietz Asia coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. Journalists are vulnerable to pressure from all sides.         The most perilous reporting beats are in conflict-affected provinces such as Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa where Mr. Khattak worked or Baluchistan where a nationalist insurgency has been raging. But not always: attacks on reporters are also rising in Karachi the countrys largest city experts say.         Pakistani reporters who work with Western news media organizations face particular dangers  especially when covering sensitive stories that reflect poorly on the security services. That has included the aftermath of the attack on Malala Yousafzai the teenage education activist who was shot by the Taliban in the northwestern Swat Valley in 2012.         Ms. Yousafzai who survived her injuries has gone on to become a global celebrity. She recently met with President Obama and Queen Elizabeth II and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. But at home the spotlight on her case has angered both the Taliban and the authorities.         At first the Taliban criticized several Western news outlets including Reuters and the B.B.C. for their coverage of her case forcing some correspondents to temporarily leave Pakistan. There has also been speculation that the security forces which have effectively run the Swat region since 2009 have also been unhappy about the attention.         Sana ul Haq a freelance journalist in Swat said he was abducted interrogated and beaten for 11 hours on Oct. 14 by men he believed were intelligence officials. He said the men had made clear that his offense had been helping two New York Times reporters gauge local reaction to the news of Ms. Yousafzais Nobel Prize nomination just days before.         Mr. Haq said the men grabbed him as he was walking home around 7 p.m. then blindfolded and drove him away in an unmarked Jeep. He was taken to a location about 30 minutes away where he was questioned for about 10 hours by three men two of whom were masked.         The men questioned him about his work and accused him of being a traitor to Pakistan and an American spy. Mr. Haq insisted he was working only as a journalist but the men accused him of lying periodically beating him with their fists and a leather whip leaving extensive bruising on his torso head and legs. They also kicked him between the legs.         Mr. Haqs abductors released him at dawn the following morning dropping him on the roadside in Mingora and warning him to tell no one of his experience.         His abductors showed detailed knowledge of New York Times reporting activities in Pakistan and repeatedly asked about and referred to Declan Walsh the newspapers bureau chief for Pakistan who was expelled from the country in May with no explanation and has remained blocked from returning.

69,100000002544538,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,,Egypt's Two-Front War for Democracy,ALAA AL ASWANY,971,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/opinion/aswani-egypts-two-front-war-for-democracy.html,,Cairo  Mariam Ashraf was an eight-year-old Coptic girl. On Oct. 20 she went with her family to the Church of the Virgin in Cairo for a relatives wedding. She was thrilled with her new hairstyle and the new white dress her mother had bought for the occasion. She stood on the street outside the church with other guests waiting for the bride and groom to arrive. Then a motorbike sped by. On it were two men who opened fire indiscriminately killing Mariam and three others and wounding scores of guests. According to an official medical report eight bullets pierced her body; she died from gunshot wounds to the chest.         Although the Muslim Brotherhood issued a statement condemning the killing it was just one in a string of attacks carried out on Coptic Christians by Egyptians associated with the Islamist organization.         According to officials in the Coptic Church there have been attacks on 73 churches in addition to scores of Coptic-owned homes and businesses since the end of June. The Copts have been persecuted for joining the demonstrations that led to the removal of President Mohamed Morsi in early July. Supporters of Mr. Morsi were incensed that the Coptic pope Tawadros II supported the armys plan for ending the Brotherhoods rule.         It is not only the Copts who have suffered from political violence since the summer. Ongoing attacks by Morsi supporters against soldiers and police officers have caused hundreds of deaths. Egyptian television broadcast a report showing Islamists attacking a police station in the town of Kerdasa on Aug. 14 with rocket-propelled grenades causing the deaths of 15 policemen. They stripped the bodies and paraded them on the street.         Mr. Morsi is now on trial for his role in 11 deaths in a clash between his supporters and opponents last December. This is fitting because his 12-month presidency saw horrendous violations of human rights.         Mr. Morsi climbed the democratic ladder to power only to kick it away after him so that no one else could join him up there. In the process he became a violent dictator. In June the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights an advocacy group found that 3462 people had been arbitrarily detained and 143 protesters killed since Mr. Morsi took power  compared with some 18000 arrests for political reasons during the nearly 30-year rule of President Hosni Mubarak. In August an Amnesty International report documented torture including severe beatings and electric shocks suffered by opponents of the Brotherhood.         Mr. Morsi entered office on a wave of hope and exited on a wave of despair. In June 2012 millions streamed onto the streets to celebrate his victory but their elation soon turned into hopelessness and then rage as they discovered that he was a puppet controlled by the Brotherhoods supreme leader. That November Mr. Morsi issued a decree annulling the Constitution and granting himself sweeping powers over the legal system. It amounted to coup dÃ©tat.         As with Mr. Mubarak the end of Mr. Morsis dictatorship began in the streets. In the spring young activists instituted a campaign called Tamarrod (Arabic for rebellion) that collected millions of signature for a no-confidence petition demanding Mr. Morsis ouster. It was Tamarrod that called on Egyptians to go onto the streets on June 30 to show their dissatisfaction.         With Egypt on the brink of a civil war the army sided with the will of the Egyptian people removed Mr. Morsi and announced a road map to amend the Constitution and carry out new parliamentary and presidential elections.         What is happening in Egypt goes beyond political disagreement: We are seeing an armed struggle between the state and terrorist groups who are trying to plunge the country into something like the Syrian paradigm of chaos. Hence most Egyptians have given their support to the army in its war against the terrorism of the Brotherhood. This leaves an unanswered question: Is Egypt getting any nearer to instituting a real democracy?         The Brotherhoods removal from power has given rise to a confrontation between the forces of the revolution and those of the Mubarak regime. Supporters of Mr. Mubarak still wield some power in the government and are resisting reforms to the state apparatus that enabled them to amass fortunes.         Meanwhile the millions of young people who created the revolution and have nurtured it since 2011 are demanding a new constitution that would ban the trial of civilians by military courts and subject the presidency to oversight by independent authorities. They also want to impose a more progressive tax system and reduce income inequality.         This tension between the democrats and the old guard is evident in the case of the television host Bassem Youssef Egypts answer to Jon Stewart whose satirical news program had devoted whole episodes to the antics of Mr. Morsi. The program was pulled after he fell from power. It recently came back on air with Mr. Youssef poking fun at the army chief Gen. Abdul-Fattah al-Sisi. The episode divided public opinion between those who defended Mr. Youssefs right to lampoon senior officials and grass-roots supporters of General Sisi who considered the satire beyond the pale. The channel that produces the series was obliged to apologize. It took the program off the air.         Similarly alarming is the one-year prison sentence imposed by a military court on a newspaper journalist Hatem Abu el-Nour who was convicted of the dubious charge of impersonating military personnel.         The battle for Egypt is being waged on two fronts: one against the terrorist operations carried out by Morsi supporters and the other to bring into existence a true democratic state. Mr. Morsis democratically elected dictatorship did nothing to advance that true revolution.

There were few such moments in their embarrassing 120-89 loss to the San Antonio Spurs.         The fans cheered the loudest when play was halted midway through the first quarter and J. R. Smith rose from his seat on the bench. Smith proceeded to miss his first six shots. He spent the entire fourth quarter on the bench sitting expressionless.         The Knicks look to Smith who made his season debut after being suspended for the first five games for violating the N.B.A.s antidrug policy to provide energy and another reliable scorer to take the pressure off Anthony. But Smiths first attempt was an off-balance air ball after he had dribbled into two defenders. Early in the second quarter he shot an air ball on a 3-point attempt.         He finished with 5 points and shot 1 of 9 from the field in 20 minutes. He also had four turnovers.         I was just missing a lot of shots and I didnt get to the basket like I wanted to said Smith who emphasized that he was not rusty despite playing in only one preseason game after having knee surgery over the summer.         Perhaps searching for answers Smith changed his sneakers from bright orange to white after his first 10 minutes. He was the first player on the court for the second-half warm-up practicing midrange jumpers and 3-pointers.         When Smith made his first basket a 3-pointer with 8 minutes 43 seconds left in the third quarter he tilted his head and threw his hands up. The Spurs were leading 73-50.         Two of Smiths turnovers were perplexing. On one Smith lost his dribble and the ball hit the referee James Capers. Smith thought the ball was out of bounds allowing the Spurs Kawhi Leonard to grab it with ease. And one of Smiths crosscourt passes landed in the hands of Knicks Coach Mike Woodson.         I was just trying to find guys and I wasnt able to get in the same rhythm that Im normally in Smith said.         Woodson said he had not expected Smith to be at his best.         The young man hadnt played he said. Exhibition and practice is not the same as a real game and he struggled.         Smiths play was reminiscent of his playoff performance last season. After being suspended for a game for elbowing Jason Terry during the Knicks opening-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics Smith shot 29.1 percent (34 of 117) from the field for the rest of the postseason making just 13 of 50 3-point attempts.         The Knicks signed Smith 28 to a three-year $17.95 million contract in July after he averaged 18.1 points a game last season. Four days later he had surgery to repair the patella tendon and lateral meniscus in his left knee. In September he was suspended.         Were happy that hes back Andrea Bargnani said. We all know how good J. R. is offensively. Im sure hes going to find his rhythm very quickly.                Also in Video »       
71,100000002543440,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,,Daring to Complain About Obamacare,LORI GOTTLIEB,877,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/opinion/daring-to-complain-about-obamacare.html,25,LOS ANGELES  THE Anthem Blue Cross representative who answered my call told me that there was a silver lining in the cancellation of my individual P.P.O. policy and the $5400 annual increase that I would have to pay for the Affordable Care Act-compliant option: now if I have Stage 4  cancer  or need a sex-change operation Id be covered regardless of pre-existing conditions. Never mind that the new provider network would eliminate coverage for my and my sons long-term doctors and hospitals.         The Anthem rep cheerily explained that despite the companys  I paraphrase  draconian rates and limited network my benefits which also include maternity coverage (handy for a 46-year-old) would be actually much richer.         I of course would be actually much poorer. And it was this aspect of the bum deal that to my surprise turned out to be a very unpopular thing to gripe about.         Obamacare or Kafkacare? I posted on Facebook as soon as I hung up with Anthem. I vented about the call and wrote that the president should be protecting the middle class not making our lives substantially harder. For extra sympathy I may have thrown in the fact that Im a single mom. (O.K. I did.)         Then I sat back and waited for the love to pour in. Or at least the like. Lots of likes. After all I have 1037 Facebook friends. Surely theyd commiserate.         Except that they didnt.         Instead aside from my friend David who attempted to cheer me up with My dad who never turns down a bargain would take the sex change just because its free my respondents implied  in posts that to my annoyance kept getting more likes  that it was beyond uncool to be whining about myself when the less fortunate would finally have insurance.         The nation has been better off wrote one friend. Over 33 million people who did not have insurance are now going to get it. Thats all fine and good for the nation but what about my $5400 rate hike (after-tax dollars I wanted to add but dared not in this group of previously closeted Mother Teresas)? Another friend wrote Yes Im paying an extra 200 a month but Im okay with doing that so that others who need it can have health care.         I was shocked. Who knew my friends were such humanitarians? Has Obamacare made it un-P.C. to be concerned by a serious burden on my familys well-being?         The heated reactions even moved offline. Frustrated I observed to one friend who was covered through her work that when an issue didnt affect people directly they became theoretically generous. Ask them to donate several thousand dollars so that the less fortunate can have medical insurance  which is exactly what President Obama is asking me to do  and Ill bet theyd change their tune about ending inequality and creating fairness and doing whats good for the country.         Refreshingly the two people who showed real empathy were my insurance broker and my friend Nicole who sent daily links to news stories about people who were also stripped of their coverage and mandated to buy expensive exchange or private policies without access to their current doctors yet just missed the cutoff for subsidies.         There was one story about people suing Anthem for not being grandfathered in after changing their policies post-2010. In fact it was in 2011 that I altered mine dumping maternity benefits so that I didnt have to pay for everyone elses pregnancies. Little did I know Id end up losing my insurance  and  paying for everyone elses pregnancies.         There was even an article about a cancer patient who had lost access to her doctors. To her credit Nicole refrained from saying But Lori this woman has cancer and you are so much more fortunate!         Like Bridget Joness smug marrieds the smug insureds  friends who were covered through their own or spouses employers or who were grandfathered into their plans  asked why I didnt just switch all of our long-term doctors suck it up and pay an extra $200 a month for a restrictive network on the exchange or marry the guy Im dating. How romantic: I didnt marry you just to save money honey. I married you for your provider network.         Along with the smug insureds President Obama doesnt care much about the relatively small percentage of us with canceled coverage and no viable replacement. He keeps apologizing while maintaining that its for the good of the country a vast improvement over all.         And the over all might agree. But the self-employed middle class is being sacrificed at the altar of politically correct rhetoric with nobody helping to ensure our health fiscal or otherwise because its trendy to cheer for the underdog. Embracing the noble cause is all very well  as long as yours isnt the fortunate family that loses its access to comprehensive affordable health care while the rest of the nation gets it.         The truly noble act here is being performed by my friend Nicole who keeps posting Obamacare fiasco stories on my Facebook page despite being conspicuously ignored except for my single like. Its the lone like that falls in the forest the click nobody wants to hear.

72,100000002544540,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,,Anarchy and Death in Mali,JEAN-PHILIPPE REMY,945,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/opinion/anarchy-and-death-in-mali.html,,Johannesburg  Kidal in the desert of northern  Mali  is a dusty tedious town reminiscent of some long-forgotten Foreign Legion outpost with its crenellated fort and military camps and too many people walking about with guns. Getting there is difficult and dangerous. There are no commercial flights and on the roads carjackings are common.         Ghislaine Dupont a reporter for Radio France Internationale and her sound engineer Claude Verlon managed to get space on a United Nations flight. They planned to report on the situation in Kidal where French troops and United Nations peacekeepers are trying to keep the peace.         Instead on Nov. 2 shortly after they arrived and just after they finished interviewing the leader of the main non-jihadist Tuareg separatist group they were abducted by four men forced into a pickup truck driven into the desert and killed.          Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb  claimed responsibility for the deaths of Ghislaine and Claude proclaiming that they had been killed in retaliation for the French crusade against Muslims and adding that the action was made in defense of Azawad the name separatist Tuaregs use for Northern Mali.         Gigi as we called her knew her way around dangerous places. I met her when I first began covering the continent 15 years ago when she was already considered a seasoned Africa hand. We had both covered the Congo war. We would talk frequently and exchange information when we could. She had just started to cover the fighting in Mali. Claude whom I also knew for many years and worked with from time to time was more than a technician. He too loved Africa and journalism interjecting interviews with insightful questions.         Their loss is painful for me and my colleagues even more so because it is so senseless. Some security sources speculate that the abductors killed them so that they could quickly flee after the pickup truck broke down only 12 kilometers from Kidal.         These ghastly killings are disturbing on several other levels  some complex some depressingly simple some deliberately ambiguous. For one they show that none of the forces stationed in Kidal could prevent four men from abducting two foreigners in broad daylight. For another they indicate that anything relating to France the small Satan in Al Qaedas eyes might be a target. As a source in the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad or M.N.L.A. told me: Kidal is completely out of control.         I reached Kidal last February at the height of the French militarys campaign to check the southern advance of AQIM and its allies: Ansar Dine (Defenders of the Faith) and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa known as Mujao. Over several weeks French and Malian soldiers took back control of the main cities of the north: Timbuktu Gao and Kidal. More importantly they managed to clean out the rebel stronghold in the Adrar des Ifoghas region north of Kidal where the rebels had spent the last decade building up secret camps. It was quite an achievement. Adrar is a perfect natural fortress with plentiful water and hundreds of caves to conceal small units of fighters.         Success bred complacency in Bamako and Paris. The jihadists had been badly mauled a new president was elected and billions of dollars of foreign aid were in the pipeline. Mali looked almost reunified; things seemed promising.         But the recent killings show that Kidals situation remains as uncertain as it was in February. Though the extremists seemed to be gone and the secular M.N.L.A. was supposed to be in charge sporadic violence continued. There were suicide car bombings shootings and other attacks when I went there last winter to interview M.N.L.A. leaders. They warned me then that I was an easy target for hostage-takers and insisted that I move frequently from one house to another. They had good reasons to be careful. On the night of Feb. 23 as I was moving to yet another place there was a loud explosion. A suicide bomber his pickup loaded with TNT killed several M.N.L.A. members.         Since then a ditch has been dug around the city to prevent rebel pickup trucks from getting quickly in and out of town. Otherwise the military force of 400 French and United Nations forces along with Malian troops tries to keep a low profile and avoid getting sucked into local rivalries between the Ifoghas clan of the Tuareg and other groups that live there.         Perhaps this rivalry has something to do with the deaths of my two friends. Ifoghas leaders were involved in the liberation of four French hostages abducted three years ago. These hostages were freed roughly at the moment when Ghislaine and Claude were landing in Kidal. According to French and local sources the deal with AQIM to free them called for a ransom of more than ¬20 million. Some sources have indicated that the deal also provided for the release of several Ansar Dine insurgents jailed in Bamako and that those rebels were not freed.         Its possible that the two murders were in retaliation for what could be understood as a breach of contract. Its also possible that the huge amount of money simply convinced some other group to try its luck.         Two factors are harming efforts to stabilize Mali: the local struggle for power and AQIMs determination to harass not only French soldiers but any other outside presence.         As a French security source who is involved in the liberation of hostages in the region says of the killing of the two RFI journalists: Were going to see more and more body bags arriving.         
73,100000002545061,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,,South Florida Faces Ominous Prospects From Rising Waters,NICK MADIGAN,1074,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/us/south-florida-faces-ominous-prospects-from-rising-waters.html,12,MIAMI BEACH  In the most dire predictions  South Florida s delicate barrier islands coastal communities and captivating subtropical beaches will be lost to the rising waters in as few as 100 years.         Further inland the Everglades the river of grass that gives the region its fresh water could one day be useless some scientists fear contaminated by the inexorable advance of the salt-filled ocean. The Florida Keys the pearl-like strand of islands that stretches into the Gulf of Mexico would be mostly submerged alongside their exotic crown jewel Key West.         I dont think people realize how vulnerable  Florida  is Harold R. Wanless the chairman of the geological sciences department at the University of Miami said in an interview last week. Were going to get four or five or six feet of water or more by the end of the century. You have to wake up to the reality of whats coming.         Concern about rising seas is stirring not only in the halls of academia but also in local governments along the states southeastern coast.         The four counties there  Broward Miami-Dade Monroe and Palm Beach with a combined population of 5.6 million  have formed an alliance to figure out solutions.         Long battered by hurricanes and prone to flooding from intense thunderstorms Florida is the most vulnerable state in the country to the rise in sea levels.         Even predictions more modest than Professor Wanlesss foresee most of low-lying coastal Florida subject to increasingly frequent floods as the polar ice caps melt more quickly and the oceans surge and gain ground.         Much of Floridas 1197-mile coastline is only a few feet above the current sea level and billions of dollars worth of buildings roads and other infrastructure lies on highly porous limestone that leaches water like a sponge.         But while officials here and in other coastal cities many of whom attended a two-day conference on  climate change  last week in Fort Lauderdale have begun to address the problem the issue has gotten little traction among state legislators in Tallahassee.         The issue appears to be similarly opaque to segments of the community  business real estate tourism  that have a vested interest in protecting South Floridas bustling economy.         The business community for the most part is not engaged said Wayne Pathman a Miami land-use lawyer and Chamber of Commerce board member who attended the Fort Lauderdale conference. Theyre not affected yet. They really havent grasped the possibilities.         It will take a truly magnificent effort Mr. Pathman said to find answers to the critical issues confronting the area. Ultimately he said the most salient indicator of the crisis will be the insurance industrys refusal to handle risk in coastal areas here and around the country that are deemed too exposed to rising seas.         People tend to underestimate the gravity here I think because it sounds far off said Ben Strauss the director of the Program on Sea Level Rise at Climate Central an independent organization of scientists. People are starting to tune in but its not front and center. Miami is a boom town now but in the future that Im very confident will come it will be obvious to everyone that the sea is marching inland and its not going to stop.         The effects on real estate value alone could be devastating Dr. Strauss said. His  research  shows that there is about $156 billion worth of property and 300000 homes on 2120 square miles of land that is less than three feet above the high tide line in Florida.         At that same level Dr. Strauss said Florida has 2555 miles of road 35 public schools one power plant and 966 sites listed by the Environmental Protection Agency such as hazardous waste dumps and sewage plants.         The amount of real estate value and the number of properties potentially affected rises incrementally with each inch of sea-level rise he said.         Professor Wanless insists that no amount of engineering proposals will stop the onslaught of the seas. At two to three feet we start to lose everything he said.         The only answer he said is to consider drastic measures like establishing a moratorium on development along coastal areas and to compel residents whose homes are threatened to move inland.

About 500000 people were allowed to return to their homes on Sunday according to state media in Vietnam.         Weakened to Category 1 strength the typhoon came ashore near the port of Haiphong the Hong Kong Observatory reported. It was expected to weaken further as it moved inland toward Nanning China.

75,100000002526201,0,Article,News,Technology,technology,,Big Data’s Little Brother,QUENTIN HARDY,1255,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/technology/gathering-more-data-faster-to-produce-more-up-to-date-information.html,1,SAN FRANCISCO  David Soloff is recruiting an army of hyperdata collectors.         The company he co-founded Premise created a smartphone application that is now used by 700 people in 25 developing countries. Using guidance from Mr. Soloff and his co-workers these people mostly college students and homemakers photograph food and goods in public markets.         By analyzing the photos of prices and the placement of everyday items like piles of tomatoes and bottles of shampoo and matching that to other data Premise is building a real-time inflation index to sell to companies and Wall Street traders who are hungry for insightful data.         Within five years Id like to have 3000 or 4000 people doing this said Mr. Soloff who is also Premises chief executive. Its a useful global inflation monitor a way of looking at food security or a way a manufacturer can judge what kind of shelf space he is getting.         Collecting data from all sorts of odd places and analyzing it much faster than was possible even a couple of years ago has become one of the hottest areas of the technology industry. The idea is simple: With all that processing power and a little creativity researchers should be able to find novel patterns and relationships among different kinds of information.         For the last few years insiders have been calling this sort of analysis Big Data. Now Big Data is evolving becoming more hyper and including all sorts of sources. Start-ups like Premise and ClearStory Data as well as larger companies like General Electric are getting into the act.         A picture of a pile of tomatoes in Asia may not lead anyone to a great conclusion other than how tasty those tomatoes may or may not look. But connect pictures of food piles around the world to weather forecasts and rainfall totals and you have meaningful information that people like stockbrokers or buyers for grocery chains could use.         And the faster that happens the better so people can make smart  and quick  decisions.         Hyperdata comes to you on the spot and you can analyze it and act on it on the spot said Bernt Wahl an industry fellow at the Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology at the University of California Berkeley. It will be in regular business soon with everyone predicting and acting the way Amazon instantaneously changes its prices around.         Standard statistics might project next summers ice cream sales. The aim of people working on newer Big Data systems is to collect seemingly unconnected information like todays heat and cloud cover and a hometown teams victory over the weekend compare that with past weather and sports outcomes and figure out how much mint chip ice cream mothers would buy today.         At least that is the hope and there are early signs it could work. Premise claims to have spotted broad national inflation in India months ahead of the government by looking at onion prices in a couple of markets.         The photographers working for Premise are recruited by country managers and they receive 8 to 10 cents a picture. Premise also gathers time and location information from the phones plus a few notes on things like whether the market was crowded. The real insight comes from knowing how to mix it all together quickly.         Price data from the photos gets blended with prices Premise receives from 30000 websites. The company then builds national inflation indexes and price maps for markets in places like Kolkata India; Shanghai; and Rio de Janeiro.         Premises subscribers include Wall Street hedge funds and Procter & Gamble a company known for using lots of data. None of them would comment for this article. Subscriptions to the service range from $1500 to more than $15000 a month though there is also a version that offers free data to schools and nonprofit groups.         The new Big Data connections are also benefiting from the increasing amount of public information that is available. According to research from the McKinsey Global Institute 40 national governments now offer data on matters like population and land use. The United States government alone has 90000 sets of open data.

78,100000002545108,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,media,Using Humor to Talk About Birth Control,TANZINA VEGA,747,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/media/using-humor-to-talk-about-birth-control.html,8,FEW things may be less comfortable to talk about with ones parents than sex and  birth control  and with that in mind a new public service campaign hopes to offer guidance through a series of ads and online videos.         The pro bono effort called We Get You promotes  Bedsider.org  a website that offers information on birth control. The campaign is aimed at African-American women 18 to 29 years old and was created in conjunction with BET Networks the Ad Council the advertising agency Havas Worldwide and the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned  Pregnancy  the organization that created Bedsider.org. The campaign will make its debut on Nov. 20 on the BET television network and online.         The broader goal of the campaign in addition to getting women to visit the site for information is to prevent the high rates of unplanned pregnancies among young adults. According to data from Bedsider.org seven out of every 10 pregnancies involving women 18 to 29 are unplanned. Among African-American women that age the percentage is slightly higher at 73 percent.         When people get into a relationship there is a moment in that relationship where you say Were going to stop using a  condom  we trust each other. But theres not much planning after that said Larry Swiader the senior director of digital media at the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.         Another issue driving the high rates of pregnancy for young adults is inconsistent use of birth control he said. Forty-four percent of unmarried African-American women who are in a sexual relationship but are not trying to get pregnant use contraception inconsistently or not at all according to data provided by Bedsider.org.         The series of short videos relies on a heavy dose of humor to get the point across. In one a mother enters the bathroom where her daughter is brushing her teeth. Honey? says the mother in a sweet tone Its time to talk about your vagina. Visibly uncomfortable the daughter stops brushing her teeth and stares into the bathroom mirror as her mother places a pamphlet bearing the title Your Vagina and You in front of her.         A second spot features a granddaughter getting ready to drive her grandmother home when the grandmother starts reminiscing about being the granddaughters age. Back then I was a sex expert the grandmother says. They used to call me Buttered Biscuit she adds before offering her granddaughter advice on birth control. The granddaughter winces.         A third video features a young couple having a candlelit dinner at the boyfriends house when his dog begins mounting the girlfriends leg. While the table and the candle shake furiously the boyfriend brings up the topic of birth control. The girlfriend gives him a wary look.         The campaign uses humor as opposed to lecturing our young people said Debra Lee the chairwoman and chief executive of BET Networks. It gives them the benefit of the doubt and lets them know they are smart.         Sonya Lockett the vice president for public affairs at BET Networks said the campaign would also be useful in exposing young women to new forms of birth control. It lets you know that there are a myriad of other avenues for you as a young woman; its not just about condoms and its not just about the pill she said.         In fact in 2013 the most common forms of birth control viewed on Bedsider.org included the intrauterine device hormone implants that are placed in the arm the pill and hormone injections or the shot which are all methods Mr. Swiader described as low maintenance and highly effective.         Bedsider.org also offers video testimonials from women describing their experiences using different methods of birth control. For men there are videos that explain birth control methods like withdrawal or the birth control ring. (Its sort of like one of those jelly bracelets from the 80s the male narrator explains.)         The campaign is part of a second wave of ads that Bedsider.org created in partnership with the Ad Council to address unplanned pregnancy in young adults. In 2011 the first set of ads were focused on all young adults not just African-American women. In that series the ads featured couples engaging in awkward sexual moments like a woman spraying too much whipped cream on her partner and a man  sneezing  on his partners stomach as he prepared to perform oral sex. You didnt give up on sex says the ad. Dont give up on birth control either.

In the next 10 days the plants operator the Tokyo Electric Power Company is set to start the delicate and risky task of using a crane to remove the fuel assemblies from the pool a critical step in a long decommissioning process that has already had serious setbacks.         Just 36 men will carry out the tense operation to move the fuel to safer storage; they will work in groups of six in two-hour shifts throughout the day for months. A separate team will work overnight to clear any debris inside the pool that might cause the fuel to jam when a crane tries to lift it out possibly causing damage.         We are making our final preparations Naomi Hirose the president of the company known as Tepco said at a news conference on Friday. We hope to be done by the end of next year.         The attempt to remove the fuel rods underscores the complicated potentially hazardous work that lies ahead at the plant which was crippled by explosions and by meltdowns in three of its reactors in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.         The operation addresses a threat that has hung over the plant since the crisis started. Though the fuel has cooled significantly since the early days of the crisis and Tepco has shored up the reactor building it is still dangerous to have the fuel high up in a damaged structure that could collapse in another quake experts warn.         But removing it poses dangers too. The fuel rods must remain immersed in water to block the gamma radiation they emit and allow workers to be in the area and to prevent the rods from overheating. An accident could expose the rods and  in a worst-case scenario some experts say  allow them to release radioactive materials beyond the plant.         Plant engineers will use a crane to lift the fuel assemblies from the pool into giant casks that have been lowered into the water and then lift the casks out of the building. Each cask will be placed on a trailer and moved to a more secure pool at ground level.         There are potentially very big risks involved Shunichi Tanaka the head of  Japan s nuclear regulator said last week. Each assembly must be handled very carefully.         Tepco hopes that a smooth start to the removals will help it regain at least some of the credibility it lost in its response to the quake and tsunami that overwhelmed the plant and in the cleanup.         A string of blunders by Tepco including underestimating the potential for large amounts of groundwater to become contaminated and reach the ocean has some experts wondering whether the company is up to the task.         Even minor problems with the fuel removal could strengthen calls for the decommissioning work to be taken out of Tepcos hands.         All I can do is pray that nothing goes wrong said Yasuro Kawai a former plant engineer who now heads a group that is independently monitoring the decommissioning process.         He said much depends on whether the assemblies were damaged during removal  for example if the casks carrying them were to accidentally fall to the ground exposing the rods  and whether such damage was severe enough to force workers to evacuate.         If they drop the rods will the situation be easily contained or do we need to worry about a more dangerous chain of events? Mr. Kawai said. There are just too many variables involved to say for sure.         Tepco officials said the removal plan has been vetted by the companys engineers and outside experts including the International Atomic Energy Agency. But the work will be carried out by a Tepco-led team and without external supervision.         The company said it has taken extra precautions. The plant has been preparing for months erecting a steel structure around and over the damaged reactor building and fitting it with a crane to lift the casks about 100 feet in the air. Underwater cameras will help engineers search for debris left from the original explosion that might jam the assemblies and a robotic arm will be used to try to remove any debris that does get in the way.         The crane is designed to hold its load if power is lost and Tepco said it has doubled the cabling that will lift the cask which could weigh as much as 90 tons when filled.         The biggest fear is that an earthquake or tsunami will disrupt the fuel assembly transfer. Sizable aftershocks from the 2011 quake frequently jolt the region. Last month a magnitude-7.1 quake off the coast near Fukushima caused a small tsunami.         Tepco has said the steel covering structure and crane can withstand an earthquake as strong as the magnitude-9.0 quake that damaged the plant in 2011.         Lake H. Barrett a former United States Department of Energy official who was in charge of removing fuel from a stricken reactor after an accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979 is now a special adviser to the president of Tepco. He said he believed that the risks in removing the fuel from the Reactor No. 4 pool at Fukushima were small and that a significant release of radioactive material was highly unlikely.         And when the job is done Mr. Barrett said the overall danger will be reduced.         This fuel really needs to come back down to a ground-level pool that is not damaged he said. Thats going to improve the risk situation.         In the early days of the crisis American officials were so worried about the pool that they advised Americans to stay farther from the plant than the Japanese government ordered which many Japanese officials still remember with humiliation. The worst-case scenario of a breach in the pool leaving the fuel rods uncovered has not happened and Tepco believes the fuel assemblies have relatively little damage.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: December 11 2013 Because of an editing error an article on Nov. 11 about the risks involved in removing spent fuel rods from a crippled reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan referred incorrectly to a step in the procedure. Plant engineers planned to use a crane to lift the fuel assemblies into giant casks that had been lowered into the spent fuel pool where the rods are stored then lift the casks out of the pool; the assemblies would not be lifted out of the pool and into the casks.

Musicians enthrall audiences with high-octane performances reflecting Salvadors status as a bastion of Brazils popular culture. Luxury residential towers overlook a stunning harbor. The industrial park on the citys outskirts contains cutting-edge plants opened by Ford and other multinational corporations.          Salvador the largest city in northeastern Brazil a region that is still posting enviable economic growth even as the national economy slows should have the wind at its back. But the boom here is producing another outcome: Instead of celebrating Salvador as its residents have long done  the writer Jorge Amado once called it a laid-back place of eternal beauty  many people here are increasingly revolted by their city.         In what may serve as a cautionary tale for other cities in the developing world Salvadors rising prosperity on display in new shopping malls sprawling megachurches and well-guarded gated communities exists alongside a troubled reality. A surge in violent crime has transformed Salvador into Brazils murder capital motorists grapple with traffic that ranks among the most chaotic and violent of any South American city and resentment festers over the metamorphosis of once-elegant seaside districts into crime-ridden areas with abandoned buildings best described as ruins.         Our political leaders are of such mediocrity that it is hard to comprehend said Antonio RisÃ©rio a writer and historian who has chronicled Salvadors origins as Brazils first capital from 1549 to 1763 and the cradle of African-Brazilian culture. Were not a failed city but were a place where the middle class lives in fear added Mr. RisÃ©rio among the most acerbic critics of how Salvador has recently changed.         Salvador now has more homicides each year than any other Brazilian metropolis including the megacity SÃ£o Paulo which is four times as large. The security breakdown has grown so acute and surreal this year that murder victims are being found beheaded  as in the case  of a body found on a road to the airport and tortured by mobs  as in the case  of a rape suspect ambushed by residents in a slum called Bairro da Paz.         While  inequality  has persisted rising incomes and access to credit helped double Salvadors car fleet over the past decade to more than 750000. But with highway projects stalled or nonexistent and parts of Salvador still filled with colonial-era cobblestone streets and alleyways road rage is intensifying.         This city of 2.9 million (the metropolitan area has almost five million) was stunned in October by a  traffic skirmish  in Ondina one of Salvadors most exclusive residential districts as video cameras captured a 45-year-old ophthalmologist in an S.U.V. running down two siblings on a motorcycle crushing them to death against the fence of a hotel.         Complicating Salvadors mobility challenges are the public transportation debacles symbolized by a lavishly expensive subway system that somehow has never functioned. Brazilian construction companies began building the subways huge pillars of reinforced concrete designed for commuter trains imported from Asia in 1997.         The Brazilian authorities spent hundreds of millions of dollars of public money on the project and auditors found big cost overruns but it was not completed. Sixteen years after construction began officials finally said in October that they would spend $600 million more to get it running but only after the 2014 World Cup when other Brazilian cities plan to showcase new transit systems.         Faced with such disarray some in Salvador try to deflect criticism by noting statistics that show other cities in northeast Brazil including MaceiÃ³ and JoÃ£o Pessoa with higher per-capita murder rates. And Salvadors cultural offerings remain sublime fitting for a city that propelled some of Brazils greatest singer-songwriters like Caetano Veloso and filmmakers to fame.         But many here bemoan comparisons with Recife another city in the region that is the political base of Eduardo Campos a contender in next years presidential elections and has a lively cultural scene that produced Neighboring Sounds Brazils critically acclaimed submission in the Oscar race for the best foreign film.         Salvadors malaise is tainting its once vibrant tourism industry. In Barra a waterfront area where surfers still catch waves off sun-kissed beaches an Italian owner of a small hotel was  bludgeoned to death in late 2010 . In October a 15-year-old Brazilian tourist  was killed  in the old city center by a stray bullet from a gun battle.                Also in T Magazine »       
81,100000002497206,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Bystanders Shot by the Police Face an Uphill Fight to Win Lawsuits,J. DAVID GOODMAN,1453,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/nyregion/bystanders-shot-by-police-face-uphill-fight-to-win-lawsuits.html,19,Outside the Empire State Building in Midtown one mild morning in the summer of 2012 the crowd consisted of tourists and office workers  and a solitary gunman who was fleeing the site of a murder. As the police closed in the gunman drew his .45-caliber handgun and two officers  opened fire  discharging 16 shots in all.         Ten people were hit: the gunman who was killed and nine pedestrians caught in the hail and ricochet of police bullets.         Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg described the shooting in August 2012 as an appropriate heroic response by the officers but sympathized with those wounded. Its sad that anybody else was injured he said then.         In the months since however lawyers for the City of New York have presented a far more aggressive stance against the wounded bystanders who have sued essentially refusing to settle the cases and moving to have them thrown out before trial.         Since 2011 16 bystanders have been struck by police bullets in the city. The most recent case occurred in September when two officers near Times Square  shot at a man  they mistakenly believed had a gun. The man was not wounded but two female bystanders were. One of the women Sahar Khoshakhlagh has filed a notice of claim the precursor to a lawsuit accusing the officers of being negligent in papers received by the city in October. If she files suit Ms. Khoshakhlagh will almost certainly face a battle in court.         Since 2010 after the State Court of Appeals  threw out a lawsuit  by a bystander hit by police bullets city lawyers have taken the position that most bystander cases should be similarly dismissed.         The states highest court has recognized that police officers split-second decisions to use deadly force must be protected from this kind of second-guessing Michael A. Cardozo who is in charge of the citys Law Department said in a statement after a woman wounded in the Empire State Building shooting sued.         For city lawyers the hard-line stance is an extension of the citys strategy in fighting most policing lawsuits contesting cases that they believe have little legal merit and designating them as no-pay cases. But for those suing the police the prospect of a protracted legal fight presents an odd experience: to be shot by police officers then to have the city defend the shooting and deny any responsibility for it.         On the one hand theyre trying to protect people said Jeffrey L. Seglin an ethicist and lecturer on public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. On the other hand you think they would try to take care of people who get hurt in that process. The legal thing isnt always the right thing.         Law Department officials would not comment on the strategy in part because it involved continuing cases. A spokeswoman for the Law Department said the city evaluated each case based on its individual merit. But several defense lawyers who are representing bystanders wounded by the police said they had been told the same thing: The city is not interested in negotiating a settlement.         They said its a no-pay case said Amy B. Marion a lawyer representing a woman from North Carolina Chenin Duclos who was  wounded near  the Empire State Building. They said to me Absolutely we feel that the law is very clear in this area. Thats their position. Thats what its about for them. Its nuts and bolts.         How other cities handle bystander lawsuits can vary greatly. For six years the Chicago Law Department battled a 13-year-old who was wounded by officers firing at a fleeing suspect before winning at trial in 2010. So a 13-year-old girl who was shot in the shoulder ended up getting nothing her lawyer Russell Ainsworth said. Philadelphia reportedly reached a $1.8 million settlement last year in the case of a bystander fatally shot in 2008 by officers aiming at an armed suspect; they were cleared of wrongdoing.         New Yorks legal strategy does not call for contesting every lawsuit involving a bystander shot by the police especially in cases where the officers actions cannot be justified or if plaintiffs are willing to accept small awards. Bystanders can apply to the state Office of Victim Services for reimbursement of their medical bills and other expenses.         Since 2010 the city has chosen to settle three bystander cases stemming from two police shootings. In total the city has paid more than $18 million in 21 bystander cases since 2003 according to the city comptrollers office mostly from shootings in the 1990s and early 2000s. About $9.8 million came in three substantial jury awards.                Also in Video »

The protests were directed against a Saudi campaign to arrest and deport illegal immigrants who were given until last week to get valid work permits or leave the country. In recent days the security forces have raided the work sites of large employers of foreign laborers and the neighborhoods where they live to round up violators.         Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Persian Gulf nations have long relied on large numbers of foreign laborers from Africa Asia and elsewhere to keep their economies running by doing jobs like driving taxis and building skyscrapers as well as staffing hospitals schools and universities.         Human rights organizations have accused the gulf countries of failing to protect the rights of foreigner laborers many of whom pay large placement fees to get jobs and surrender their passports to those sponsoring them once they arrive.         On Sunday FranÃ§ois CrÃ©peau the United Nations  special rapporteur  on the human rights of migrants called on Qatar to abolish the sponsorship system for migrant laborers saying it often leads to abuses.         Qatar which is scheduled to host the 2022 World Cup has increased its reliance on foreign workers to prepare for the event.         Mr. CrÃ©peau told reporters in Qatars capital Doha that many foreign workers lived in subpar conditions and he described one worker residence he had visited as a slum Reuters reported.         Officials in gulf countries contend that no workers are forced to move to the region for jobs but that those who do can earn much more than they can at home.         The tensions in Saudi Arabia come amid a push to increase the percentage of Saudis in the countrys work force while reducing the number of foreigners.         The Saudi government announced an amnesty for foreign workers without proper work permits that ended on Nov. 4. On Saturday clashes broke out between workers and police officers in a poor neighborhood in Riyadh the capital where many migrants live.         Saudi authorities said that scores of people were injured and that hundreds were detained; more than 100 cars were damaged. One Saudi and one unidentified person were killed they said.         On Sunday thousands of laborers most of them from countries in East Africa turned themselves over to the authorities. Some had paid smugglers to get them into the kingdom while others had arrived legally but had changed jobs or not kept their employment documents up to date.         More than five million of Saudi Arabias 27 million inhabitants are foreigners most of them low-paid laborers.                Also in Video »

A very small sampling includes his support for Nafta his evisceration of welfare his support for the death penalty and his deregulation of Wall Street.

What should be questioned is how humanitarian aid is allocated.         People must have access to clean water sanitation shelter food and medical care. But when Syrian refugees crossed borders into Jordan Lebanon and Turkey one of the first questions they asked was whether their children would have access to education. Humanitarian funding by national governments for education in 2011 stood at 1.4 percent of overall funding a minuscule sum given the need.         Education is a human right that does not stop when a conflict occurs. Education provides the foundation for economic recovery and for healthier lives especially when girls are educated and is what Syrian refugees and international displaced people are requesting.         If the humanitarian community and those that fund humanitarian work are not responding to the clear requests of those in need can we truly say we are doing no harm?         LORI HENINGER

New York State has been very effective at deinstitutionalization. But deinstitutionalization cannot work if adequate community services are not in place. Because they are not many of the homeless with disorganized behavior are the chronic mentally ill who might have previously been in state psychiatric centers.         Tragically the severely compromised medical and mental states of the homeless are a blessing in disguise for some as it will give them temporary shelter in either an acute-care hospital or a nursing home. I have witnessed this pattern as a hospital psychiatrist in New York City.         Better supportive housing and community treatment programs would likely keep them healthier and prevent the cycle of costly hospitalizations.         JEFFREY B. FREEDMAN

Colleges Gauge Applicants Creativity  (news article Nov. 3):         I began your article about quirky questions on college applications with a smile on my face as I dimly remember finding them a pleasant break in my own grind of applying. But pleasure quickly turned to dismay as I read the current iterations of these questions every one of them too clever by half.         Though the article mentions that overseas students may find the questions impenetrable it doesnt point out that the same cultural barrier applies to working-class applicants those from rural school districts and the inner city those who are the first in their families to go to college and blacks and Latinos.         As a former admissions officer I know that questions like these are a practice sport and that the young people whove had practice have gained it at upper- and upper-middle-class dinner tables sparring with parents already able to give them every advantage. So to an impoverished students burden of measuring up to competitors who have had fancy internships and expensive overseas experiences colleges have added what purports to be a search for creativity but is in fact a preference for privilege.         These quirky questions can be exclusionary and may contribute to institutional racism and class discrimination in college admissions.         KELLY KLEIMAN

But while Mr. Forbes served as the public face of the event the real orchestrator was Mike Perlis Forbes Medias 60-year-old soft-spoken and folksy chief executive who has spent the last three years transforming the company from a financially troubled family business into an enterprise that has moved aggressively to embrace the new digital landscape.         As the first nonfamily member to run Forbes Media since its founding in 1917 Mr. Perlis has tried to mix Forbess storied history with its need for profits. He has preserved longtime traditions like giving employees Malcolm Forbess birthday off and has hired back 28 employees to the 370-person company who left Forbes Media during more troubled times. His credibility has also benefited from the poaching of his top talent by rival media outlets including The Washington Post and The New York Times.         Working with Forbes Medias chief product officer Lewis DVorkin Mr. Perlis has expanded the companys use of native advertising or using journalistic content for marketing purposes and has built a contributor network of 1200 bloggers. He is also expanding other revenue streams like more than doubling the number of Forbess annual conferences licensing the software it uses for its contributor network and lending its name and content to a business school willing to pay for its brand.         Mr. Perliss friends and contemporaries say his aggressive approach is necessary to save the Forbes brand.         He brought the right temperament to an organization that at the time was 93 years old said Mr. Forbes but hes not going to be the bull in the china shop.         Kenneth Lerer who has worked with Mr. Perlis while financially supporting start-ups like The Huffington Post and BuzzFeed said Hes doing what needs to be done. For the traditionalist it is a gamble. But I dont see there is another option.         Mr. Perlis who previously served as a board member for The Huffington Post and sits on BuzzFeeds board is trying to restore a brand in a vastly temperamental media market. Mr. Forbes credits him with improving revenues since his arrival and making the media group profitable; a Forbes spokeswoman said that advertising revenue for Forbes.

KLEIN,818,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/sports/hockey/after-falling-in-draft-rookie-rises-with-predators.html,8,NEWARK  Seth Jones Nashvilles teenage defenseman could be forgiven for thinking he has a personal Curse of Prudential Center. He is having an incredible first six weeks as a pro  so good that he is being considered for a spot on the United States Olympic team  but neither of his hockey visits to the building has gone well for him at all.         Its where I got drafted Jones said Sunday afternoon when asked if he was familiar with the arena. But other than that no.         On Sunday night Jones and the  Predators  lost to the  Devils  5-0. He was on the ice for two goals against including Jaromir Jagrs 686th N.H.L. goal and 1700th point; he was in the penalty box when Marek Zidlicky scored a power-play goal; and he could not put a shot on Martin Brodeur who now has shutouts in consecutive games.         Joness previous visit was in June for the N.H.L. draft. Hyped as a cant-miss prospect who would go first over all he had to wait as first Colorado then Florida then Tampa Bay chose forwards instead. Finally he fell into Nashvilles lap at No. 4 making Predators General Manager David Poile feel like the luckiest man in hockey.         Despite Sundays loss Jones 19 has been playing this season with a vengeance as if to prove the doubters wrong. He said so himself after the draft.         I have a competitive nature he said. You definitely want to prove them wrong and you definitely want to show them why they should have picked you. Thats not my only goal next year but its definitely on my list.         He really could make the Olympics when the American team is chosen next month.         He has certainly played himself into the mix said Poile who is also the general manager of Team USA. Our committee is going to keep looking at him for Sochi.         Jones one of the most highly publicized American prospects in N.H.L. history is mature beyond his years. Born in Texas and raised in Denver the son of the former N.B.A. player Popeye Jones he was a league champion with the Portland Winter Hawks and a gold medal winner with the United States junior team. He is a rare black American star in the game yet he deftly points out that he is biracial and that his mother who is white played as big a role in his athletic upbringing as his famous father. So many expectations all handled calmly by Jones.         Nashville Coach Barry Trotz who cannot say enough good things about Joness poise has entrusted him with a slot in the first defense pairing alongside Shea Weber widely considered the best defenseman in hockey.         Jones played 24 minutes 43 seconds Sunday just about his 24:40 average by far the most among N.H.L. rookies and 18th among all league players. He is 6 feet 4 inches yet in Trotzs estimation he skates like hes 5-10 and is so cool and collected its like he has ice in his veins. He has 2 goals and 7 points second among rookie defensemen and what makes all this even more remarkable is that he is doing it while playing on the left side after playing all his young life on the right.         Its not nearly as hard as people make it out to be to be honest Jones said. Its just a little bit different. You have to use your backhand so its tough sometimes to keep the puck in. But thats it.         Weber disagreed. Its a hard thing to do at the junior level much less the N.H.L. he said. But Seth has done it and done it well. Hes been pretty special.         Despite his size Jones plays with the low-impact artistry of his idol Nicklas Lidstrom. But last week was probably Joness toughest in the N.H.L. despite a sweet 6-4 victory on Wednesday at Colorado the team he grew up rooting for but that passed him up in the draft. In that game Jones was shaken up after being charged from behind into the boards by Colorados Jamie McGinn.         Oh man that was one of the hardest hits Ive ever taken Jones said. I didnt have a headache or anything. It was more my mouth  my teeth hit the dasher.         Against Winnipeg Jones was briefly demoted to the third defense pair and then came Sunday and the return of Joness personal Curse of Newark. But Trotz has faith in his young charge.         He understands the traditions of the game Trotz said. Hes poised and polished both on and off the ice. You dont have to tell him how to do something too many times  he knows.         Jones said of being given so much responsibility so soon: I was surprised for sure at first. The coaches have trusted me with this position. Ive just got to try to keep it going.                Also in T Magazine »

That is the idea behind a new $120 million venture by Scooter Braun the manager of hit acts like Justin Bieber Carly Rae Jepsen and Psy.         In a deal that has kept the music industry guessing for months Mr. Braun is assembling a coalition of managers and musicians and raising an investment fund intended to strengthen their position in the changing music industry according to several people with direct knowledge of the plan.         Mr. Braun is in advanced talks with a number of potential partners including the singer and rapper Drake along with his managers; Jason Owen who represents Shania Twain and the country band Little Big Town; and Troy Carter who until recently managed Lady Gaga according to these people who were not authorized to speak publicly.         A spokesman for Mr. Braun declined to comment on Sunday.         Board members of Mr. Brauns venture  whose name was not known  include Thomas Tull the Hollywood producer and David Politis founder of the technology company BetterCloud.         Jeffrey Katzenberg the chief executive of DreamWorks Animation SKG is said to be acting as an informal adviser on the project.         The majority of the $120 million raised is from funds managed by Waddell & Reed Financial an investment management company based in Overland Park Kan. The venture has commitments for financing that could bring the total to about $200 million under certain conditions.         Last year Waddell & Reed invested $443 million in Mr. Tulls company Legendary Entertainment whose films include 300 and The Dark Knight.         If successful the alliance could significantly raise the profile of Mr. Braun who at 32 has already established himself as a sharp talent hunter with a keen command of social media.         His company SB Projects also encompasses a record label Schoolboy as well as divisions for film television music publishing and technology investment.         His new venture is expected to pool the resources of its members and backers to invest in technology companies publishing and other assets that historically have been outside the realm of managers.         The structure of the coalition is expected to be somewhat loose with those involved remaining relatively autonomous; most of the deals are said to cover only 50 percent of the managers businesses. Mr. Bieber is a participant in the venture.         With the balance of power in the music industry shifting away from record companies the role of managers and other artist representatives has been evolving. Recently Irving Azoff a longtime manager and the former executive chairman of Live Nation Entertainment announced a deal with the Madison Square Garden Company for a multifaceted music company.         Lyor Cohen a former top executive at the Warner Music Group also recently announced a small content management firm.         Of the partners Mr. Braun has recruited a question remains about the involvement of Mr. Carter. Lady Gaga  by far Mr. Carters most successful client  is said to have recently dismissed him which would most likely diminish the value of his company. But Mr. Carter has reportedly remained involved in the marketing of Lady Gagas new album Artpop and it is unclear whether a separation agreement between them has been fully negotiated.         Despite this uncertainty talks between Mr. Braun and Mr. Carter about the venture are said to have continued.

When Roddick the former No. 1 lost to David Ferrer at Wimbledon last year his protracted exit from the court with a whirl and kiss to the crowd suggested he would not return. Roddick announced his retirement at the  United States Open  two months later.         As  Roger Federer  said goodbye to the more than 17000 fans who watched him lose a semifinal match to  Rafael Nadal  on Sunday his departure from the ATP World Tour Finals seemed nondescript. With a bag over each shoulder he waved with one hand then another and made the short walk to the locker room at O2 Arena.         Unless Federer does an about-face retirement is not in his immediate future.         Why just walk away? said Federer who clearly wants to return to the elite eight-man event he has claimed a record six times.         But given that Federer will be 33 by the time of the 2014 season-ending championships that he endured further back problems in the summer and that he did not qualify for this years tournament until two weeks ago in Paris the question still arose: Could this be his last visit to the World Tour Finals?         No I dont think so the television analyst and former South African player Robbie Koenig said. I think what weve seen at the tail end of the season is a much healthier Federer.         Its been a positive end to the season for him and I think hes going to take that into next year.         Federer can start pondering next year in earnest after his 7-5 6-3 loss. This was Nadals first victory indoors against Federer in five tries improving his overall record in the rivalry to 22-10.         Nadals opponent in Mondays final is  Novak Djokovic  who extended his winning streak to 21 matches by beating Federers fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka 6-3 6-3.         Wawrinka said he and Federer chatted about their semifinal opponents Sunday morning although any tips they shared  judging by the results  did not help. Federer was coming off a two-and-a-half-hour win on Saturday against Juan MartÃ­n del Potro. The slugfest featured between-the-legs shots from del Potro and a no-look over-the-shoulder lob from Federer.         On Sunday the early exchanges favored Federer.         He earned the opening three break points at 3-2; on the second with ample space down the line he erred on his increasingly erratic forehand. Federer had complained Saturday that statisticians at the World Tour Finals were harsh but even he could have no argument about the miss being categorized as an unforced error.         Nadal broke for 5-4 but was then broken himself in a game highlighted by Federers capping a 30-shot rally with a forehand winner.         By the end of the first set though Federers first-serve percentage dipped and rallies became extended both to Nadals liking.         On his second opportunity Nadal served out the set to love.         He did not face a break point in the second with Federers forays to the net proving largely unsuccessful.         Federer seemed to be disappointed in the speed of the court.         Its unbelievable that he gets away with playing so far back indoors these days he said of Nadal but thats the conditions.         Djokovic also chose to play mainly behind the baseline and allow Wawrinka who compiled a hefty 10 unforced errors through four games to dictate much of the first set. Djokovic struck his first winner in the ninth game.         Djokovics forehand passing shot on a full stretch energized spectators in a second set in which Wawrinka trailed in each of his service games.         The match resembled Djokovics recent straight-set win over Wawrinka in Paris rather than their five-set thrillers at the United States Open in September and at the Australian Open in January.         The final between Nadal who is guaranteed to finish 2013 at No. 1 and Djokovic is the perfect end to the season according to Koenig.         You have the guy who is the best player in the world and the guy who is probably the hottest player in the world he said.         Federer can only watch.                Also in T Magazine »

And then there is City on Fire the 900-page debut novel that took the publishing industry by storm last week.         It was even more evidence that the long novel is experiencing a resurgence as a dozen publishers competed for the rights to release the book set in New York City in the 1970s. City on Fire was written by Garth Risk Hallberg a 34-year-old who has contributed to The New York Times Book Review and The Millions. Publishers who had a copy of the manuscript  and said they could concentrate on little else until they had finished reading it  rapturously compared it to work by Michael Chabon and Thomas Pynchon.         The book drew an advance that is highly unusual for a debut novel. In a two-day bidding war 10 publishers bid more than $1 million. Knopf emerged the victor paying close to $2 million said two people familiar with the negotiations.         Before the acquisition Diana Miller an editor at Knopf wrote Chris Parris-Lamb Mr. Hallbergs agent an email praising the book saying it was off the charts in its ambition its powers of observation its ability to be at once intellectual and emotionally generous.         Sonny Mehta the chairman and editor in chief of Knopf said on Sunday Its a large spacious and extremely ambitious novel. It has a richness to it and that was really what I responded to almost immediately.         No publication date has been set.         Mr. Parris-Lamb first read the book a year ago and said that Mr. Hallberg who took six years to write it was initially concerned about the length. Mr. Hallberg declined to be interviewed.         There are a lot of very long novels with not a lot of structure to them Mr. Parris-Lamb said. The intentionality and purposefulness with which the novel reached these lengths is really remarkable.         The events of the book Mr. Parris-Lamb wrote in a letter to publishers revolve around a central mystery: what exactly is going on behind the locked steel doors of a derelict townhouse in the East Village and what might it have to do with the shooting in Central Park in the novels opening act?         Mr. Hallberg has written an illustrated novella A Field Guide to the North American Family published in 2007.         Scott Rudin the producer bought the film rights to the new book last month before the auction for the publishing rights.         The scale of it the vision of it the big political ideas how tightly knitted all the stories are to each other and how densely and pleasurably plotted it is made me feel like for the purposes of a movie he had done the lions share of the work that anyone would have to do Mr. Rudin said. It doesnt need to be massively reinvented to be a movie.        
93,100000002544928,0,Article,Review,Arts,arts,dance,A Night of Surprising Revelations and ‘If Onlys’,ALASTAIR MACAULAY,1045,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/arts/dance/suzanne-farrells-troupe-revives-pas-de-dix.html,3,WASHINGTON  Its impressive to find one muse paying tribute to another. The choreographer George Balanchines muses were his ballerinas. Many of his ballets were designed as vehicles for them. When new they seemed principally to celebrate what was most splendidly singular about them. Paradoxically though these same works in due course became vehicles for many dissimilar ballerinas that followed. If youve seen a piece danced by its first-cast ballerina subsequent performances make you love the way the ballet still retains something   of her essence and feel how irreplaceable she is. Yet the piece also becomes something else a vehicle for the dancer of today.         Balanchine created many ballets for Maria  Tallchief  and  Suzanne Farrell . Tallchiefs glory helped to establish the young New York City Ballet in the late 1940s and early 50s; she was still there when the young Ms. Farrell emerged in the early 60s. Ms. Farrell became Balanchines main muse during the last 20 years of his life. At an Oct. 2 event at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts commemorating Tallchief Ms. Farrell was one of several featured speakers. Last week her company  the Suzanne Farrell Ballet based at the Kennedy Center here  revived a Balanchine rarity  Pas de Dix  in memory Ms. Farrell said of my friend Maria Tallchief for whom he created it.         Pas de Dix is the first of three one-act ballets in which Balanchine revisited the dances of Marius Petipas three-act Raymonda (1898) with its richly colorful score by Alexander Glazunov. Though Pas de Dix has been revived in recent years by Miami City Ballet it is not danced by New York City Ballet probably because that company still performs CortÃ¨ge Hongrois (1973) the third of Balanchines Raymonda ballets which uses much of the same music but with altered choreography.         The revival which I saw on Friday works on several levels. It captures something   of Tallchiefs burningly incisive Ã©clat (so unlike Ms. Farrells grandly wittily remote manner); it makes us feel the gap Tallchief    left behind her (though I never saw her dance I know the film of her Pas de Dix performance); and it establishes an enduring character of its own a brightly palatial Hungarian-flavored theme-and-variations treatment of medieval chivalry.         You cant miss the speed and audacious off-balance    risks with which Balanchine treats the Raymonda dances the glitter of the womens footwork the thrusting cleanness of the dancers line. Heather Ogden was Fridays ballerina a little tense in this debut performance but with elegance dash and sparkle  Tallchief virtues which Ms. Farrell has been at pains to elicit here.         The pattern of Ms. Farrells annual season is now clear. She may include a ballet or two by Jerome Robbins Maurice BÃ©jart or Paul Mejia but only works that she herself danced; she concentrates on Balanchine though and in his repertory she has the artistic authority to revive ballets she herself never performed. Her nearly weeklong season at the Kennedy Center this month included several Balanchine offerings including two extremes of modernism Agon (1957) and Episodes (1959); the Waltz of the Flowers given here with the title Tempo di Valse from his Nutcracker (1954); Duo Concertant (1972) in which pared-back modernism and Romantic ardor meet; Â and Mozartiana from 1981 originally a superlative Farrell vehicle.Â  A non-Balanchine item was the one-act Romeo and Juliet (1978) choreographed   to Tchaikovskys overture of that name by Mr. Mejia then Ms. Farrells husband.         The Suzanne Farrell Ballet is essentially a small-scale pickup operation; its dancers are either borrowed from other companies or freelancers. (I had seen Paola Hartley and Natalia Magnicaballi two of the women dancing its ballerina roles performing in Ib Andsersens Cinderella the previous weekend in Phoenix.) When you see what Ms. Farrell achieves under these circumstances its impossible not to wish that she had dancers of greater prestige and more uniform training more rehearsals more performances more touring  more money in short. In the past it has had first-rate orchestral playing (especially under the conductor Emil de Cou now at Pacific Northwest Ballet). But on Thursday and Friday while the conductor Allan Lewis provided rhythmically stiff accompaniment there were too many woodwind blips and in Agon lapses of orchestral coordination.         In most Balanchine ballets  Pas de Dix is an exception  Ms. Farrell does not try to evoke the ballets original muse or her own particular qualities. She concentrates on how the piece will reveal its current interpreter just as she herself when dancing erased the ghosts of a works previous performers. In Mozartiana on Thursday  Ms. Magnicaballi  beautifully caught the mood of prayerful invocation in the opening Preghiera. But she is demure without the playful wit or drastic contrasts of scale to illumine the climactic Theme et Variations. Elisabeth Holowchuk understands the drama of the  Agon  pas de deux but did not have the power or line to make it momentous. Pavel Gurevich proved efficient but charmless as the male lead in Pas de Dix.         Yet every work shows basic revelations of how steps illuminate music in space. I never watch the Farrell Ballet without learning something; and Im sorry I could not stay to see the alternate casts in each program. The Duo Concertant that Ms. Magnicaballi and Michael Cook danced on Friday was not the equal of the finest current performances by New York City Ballet but it was still so marvelously full of fresh inflections that it added to my sense of this duets changing moods. The same is true of the Tempo di Valse led by Ms. Hartley (in the Dewdrop role).         Some individual dancers transformed their roles. Ian Grosh and especially Matthew Renkos pulsating attack in the Bransle   Gay for two men in Agon made this the most exciting account of this duet I have seen in many years. They were vivid in showing how steps and shapes turn music into three-dimensional drama. Mr. Renko is so purposeful of step that he likewise irradiates the opening Symphony of Episodes. Kirk Henning though not a strong virtuoso brought glee beauty and sweetness to the Gigue in Mozartiana and was an angelic Romeo in Mr. Mejias ballet.         The Farrell Ballet is a conundrum: fatally limited but at its best invaluable casting a brilliant light here and there.

It runs 12 hours features a few dozen bands and takes place in barns and churches spread out around Groningen. You need to bicycle from one to another and you are given suggested routes based on musical style or region. So idealized so humane: Only in Europe right?         No.  Jazz and Colors  which had its second annual occurrence on Saturday all over Central Park is our closest analogy but New Yorkishly fuller and quicker. It is produced by Peter Shapiro owner of  Brooklyn Bowl  and the Capitol Theater and booked by Brice Rosenbloom music director of Le Poisson Rouge and programmer of Winter Jazzfest among other events. It put more bands in a much smaller space and took a third of the time. It cost nothing to visit and all the bands were assigned the same set list mostly standards and songs about New York with a half-hour free-for-all at the end.         You dont tell a jazz group what to play. But this was more a transcendentalist experiment than a jazz festival. You could hear Arturo OFarrill and the Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra play a spacious brass-defined arrangement of Herbie Hancocks Maiden Voyage at the Naumburg Bandshell then walk five minutes due west and hear the same song by Brian Charrettes Organ Sextette funkier and slenderer with flute and bass clarinet.         The point of Jazz and Colors seems basically sensory: Hear jazz feel autumn. It is not geared either toward serious cardio-aerobics or comprehending the essence of individual artists. Few of the listeners I saw had the ambitious agenda-driven park-devouring look in their eyes. You wouldnt want to try to see all 30 bands. It wasnt feasible.         Reader I saw 23 with the help of a bike from Columbus Circle (ELEW and Nature of the Next with the crowd-stirring pianist Eric Lewis on a grand piano) to the Harlem Meer (the guitarist and singer Doug Wamble). Most band spots were within sight and hearing of the East or West Drives with biking lanes. Some were harder to reach along paths far from an arterial route and surrounded by hills where only walking is allowed. Jason Kao Hwang occupied one of those; by the time I got to him he was playing a version of New York City by Gil Scott-Heron stretching out in an electric violin solo with a wah-wah pedal.         The bands played unplugged or with small amplifiers sometimes with towels over snare drums. These were the acoustics of no acoustics but some performances stood out even to someone flying past or stopping only for five minutes. The tenor saxophonist Lakecia Benjamin led a moody slow-jam version of Cherokee against perfectly graying skies on the Great Hill. The electric guitarist Mike Baggetta with the band Yard Byard in the Wild West Playground played a measured shimmery almost surfy solo that I wanted to take home and study.         And in a short unannounced set the former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh set up with the guitarist Eric Krasno and the drummer Joe Russo. The music sounded casual and friendly but fairly deep from the start: collective soloing in simple ad-lib structures and for a while on Paul McCartneys Get Back. Maybe 50 people watched on a strip just east of the Sheep Meadow called coincidentally Dead Road. Among them were a few who werent holding a Jazz and Colors map seemed unaware of the event and agnostic about improvised music per se but who had happened upon a musician they knew and loved playing through a battery-powered practice amp with his feet on the ground. Their facial expressions came as a series: recognition shock bewildered gratitude.        
95,100000002544887,0,Article,News,Arts,arts,,"War Theater, Repurposed",ROBIN POGREBIN,1209,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/arts/veterans-pursue-careers-in-the-arts.html,1,His musical pitch vocal range or favorite aria did not come up much when B. R. McDonald a tenor was kicking down doors and jumping out of planes in Iraq and Afghanistan as a member of the Armys Joint Special Operations Command.         At 12000 feet the last thing youre going tell somebody is: I was an opera singer he said.         Mr. McDonald who has a vocal performance degree from the University of North Carolina and sang in an a cappella group  the Clefhangers  put that side of himself aside during eight years in the military.         But when he left the service in 2009 and wanted to pursue a career in the performing arts Mr. McDonald felt at a loss. He had not performed in years. His skills were rusty. He had no mentor no professional contacts.         If many returning veterans have re-entry issues those reclaiming or starting careers in the arts encounter unusual hurdles Mr. McDonald said. Repertoires have gone stale. Auditions loom like dental visits. Professionals assume they are amateurs.         Most of us are stepping into it later in life he said. That presents a challenge in any industry but especially in arts and entertainment. Its all about relationships: Who do you know?         So Mr. McDonald started one of a growing number of organizations that are set up to give veterans with a creative bent the kind of support they need and have trouble finding.         His  Veteran Artist Program  helps former soldiers learn to navigate the entertainment business and pitch their projects. Its Vets on Sets initiative for example helps veterans start careers in filmmaking and its visual arts project arranges gallery shows and workshops.         Last week in honor of  Veterans Day  the program  together with the veterans group  Warrior Gateway   held a weeklong  Arts & Service Celebration  in Manhattan. The program offered networking opportunities career development and performances. In one session veterans pitched their ideas for projects to producers directors and agents. WNET the Tribeca Film Institute the Independent Filmmaker Project and New York Universitys film school were among the organizations that sent representatives.         The week concluded on Saturday with a performance of The Telling Project in which military veterans  and their family members  tell their stories onstage; various incarnations have been performed in 14 cities and nine states since 2008.         Other programs like Mr. McDonalds include one run by the  Writers Guild  Foundation that gives veterans mentors professional film and television writers.         Mike Dowling an alumnus of that program and a former Marine recently started his own organization  Veterans in Film & Television   He is an Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran turned actor the website says  with Kyle Hausmann-Stokes a former Army staff sergeant.         Various universities like Columbia and Syracuse have established programs to help veterans perfect their writing skills and several independent writing workshops for veterans have formed around the country.         A  Words After War  workshop led by Matt Gallagher a former Army captain holds weekly meetings drawing about a dozen writers  some veterans some not  to a cramped book-lined space in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. Sitting in a circle the participants discuss examples of war literature from Ernest Hemingway to Phil Caputo and critique one anothers original work.         I wouldnt have been able to do any of this on my own said Brandon Caro a member of that group who was deployed to Afghanistan as a Navy combat medic in 2006. I wouldnt have had the feedback that I need. I wouldnt have felt connected. I wouldnt have known where I was going or how I was progressing.         While the arts are often used for healing purposes Mr. McDonald said his program is not a therapy-based organization in part because assumptions about veterans post-traumatic stress can hurt their professional prospects. Its a barrier to entry to you in the industry he said if you walk into the room and everyone assumes youre screwed up.         That said returning service members face a vastly more sympathetic landscape today than those who came back from Vietnam a striking shift in the national posture toward the military that is evident in the number of current cultural exhibits and experiences that have been inspired by their efforts.         The Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra this month is presenting a new  composition  based on the poetry of the Army veteran Brian Turner. The  Brooklyn Museum just opened an exhibition  of war photography including images taken by active duty troops.                Also in T Magazine »       
96,100000002544893,0,Article,News,Arts,arts,music,Making Sure Miles Stays Forever Young,LARRY ROHTER,1227,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/arts/music/making-sure-miles-stays-forever-young.html,1,LOS ANGELES  Miles Davis  died here  more than 20 years ago but in some ways he remains as much a presence as ever and not just because recordings continue to be issued under his name. A book of his paintings and drawings was published last week a biopic about him is in the works a stamp with his image circulates and a museum exhibition devoted to his life is traveling the world.         Overseeing those initiatives and others are his three heirs: his son Erin his daughter Cheryl and their cousin Vince Wilburn Jr. Like those who manage the estates of Jimi Hendrix Bob Marley or John Coltrane they are grappling with a complicated challenge: How do you keep this trumpeter an archetype of 20th-century popular music in the public eye and maintain his brand even as his original core audience is aging?         Were talking to everybody because were involved in growing and promoting and exposure Erin Davis said during a long joint interview late last month at the office of the heirs publicists here. Its taken me 20 years to realize what were doing and how it affects the future.         The heirs confront a paradox: With more than four million copies sold in the United States alone Daviss 1959 album Kind of Blue is the most popular jazz record of all time. But the rest of his catalog which includes historic recordings like Birth of the Cool and Bitches Brew and covers a gamut of styles from hard bop to fusion and funk is not as familiar to the public.         Davis left behind an enormous body of work: In a recording career spanning nearly 50 years he made well over 100 albums. The release of a limited-edition 70-CD boxed set in 2009 was followed two years later by a 20-CD box with miniature sleeves that mimic the original LPs. On Monday a set of remastered mono versions of the first nine albums Davis recorded for Columbia Records now a part of Sony  is being issued .         But there is much more in Columbias vaults in the archives of television and radio networks in countries where Davis toured and in the familys own collection. (Davis recorded all his shows and rehearsals once the technology became available.) The heirs however talk of the need to exercise restraint to avoid the risk of diluting the value of the Davis name.         We dont want to rehash or saturate the market with Oh heres another Miles recordÂ  said Mr. Wilburn who played drums in his uncles ensembles in the 1980s and now leads his own band. We dont put things out just for the sake of putting things out. This is really thought out from a blueprint.         Many of the releases in recent years including Mondays seem aimed at completists and other longtime fans. The bigger test is the casual listener especially a new generation that may be only vaguely aware of Davis.         Lots of young people have heard of Miles Davis and make some association with his name even if its just Oh hes coolÂ  said Adam Block the president of Sonys Legacy label which handles the reissues. Our job is to find ways to tell stories that validate those feelings and educate those with some interest in his music.         He added: Theres a need not just to refresh memories but a desire to create new ones.         In recent years Daviss heirs have stepped up their efforts to take his music to audiences at events like the indie-oriented CMJ Music Marathon in New York. At last years SXSW music festival in Austin Tex. they even sponsored the  Miles Davis House  described as a genre-bending odyssey featuring rock and pop bands that professed an affinity to his music.         I always want the next generation to know about Miles Erin Davis said. Some people figure it out for themselves. But with others you have to show them something and they come to it.         The museum exhibition called We Want Miles is an expression of the same impulse. Though it has not yet toured the United States it has been shown in France Canada and Brazil. Cheryl Davis described the multimedia retrospective as a comprehensive walk through his life with trumpets pictures people speaking about him and original manuscripts and sheet music.         As part of their outreach to a younger audience the Davis heirs have also been pursuing collaborations with hip-hop artists. Mr. Wilburn mentioned overtures to Questlove of the Roots Pharcyde and Nas but also said that its got to be tastefully done because people have played the samples for us and if its derogatory towards women or people of color were not about that.

97,100000002544930,0,Article,Review,Books,books,,A City Built on a Paradox: Cooperative Individualism,JANET MASLIN,926,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/books/amsterdam-by-russell-shorto.html,6,One of the best-known fables about the Dutch is the story of the boy who wards off disaster by putting his finger in a leaky dike. As Russell Shorto points out in his new history of Amsterdam this tale was made up by an American (Mary Mapes Dodge who had never been to Holland when she wrote her 1865 book  Hans Brinker or The Silver Skates  in which the account of the boys wondrous feat appears). And it is a nonsensical story in the Netherlands where heroism is often a communal effort.         Were the Dutch to construct such a fairy tale Mr. Shorto writes the hero would probably be the town water board.         Mr. Shorto a regular contributor to The New York Times and the author of the superb 2004 book  The Island at the Center of the World  drew on Amsterdams history as he described the founding of New Amsterdam a.k.a. New York. Now he devotes a full volume to Amsterdam and has to struggle a bit to make a consistent case for it as the worlds most liberal city. This claim becomes a stretch at times. Amsterdam would have succeeded even without an overworked organizing principle.         A History of the Worlds Most Liberal City is also a subtitle likely to be misunderstood. The book uses liberalism to describe an overall attitude not a particular political position. And that attitude championing individual freedoms while showing how they support a capitalist economic structure has appeal for both ends of the political spectrum. Amsterdams attitude is Together we maintain a society of individuals Mr. Shorto writes. He acknowledges that for an American raised on a diet of raw individualism it remains a bit of a challenge to parse that logic.         Its fitting that Mr. Shorto uses Amsterdams water problems as a prime example of what cooperative effort can accomplish. About a thousand years ago inhabitants of the region began building dikes to keep out the sea and cut water channels into peat bogs: They thus set off a never-ending struggle against nature one that continues today.         Because he has a penchant for good anecdotes Mr. Shorto mentions that the Dutch and their water battle appear in a Dutch book called The Encyclopedia of Stupidity. But he also lauds the success of the group effort and the thriving economy that it helped initiate. This books story of how Amsterdam became an ascendant port city leads naturally into accounts of the Dutch East India Companys thriving global trade and Amsterdams development of an early stock exchange as an offshoot of its new wealth. When faced with inconvenient facts like the slave labor instrumental in this financial miracle or the atypical nature of Amsterdam among other Dutch cities Mr. Shorto has a simple strategy: gloss over them.         But the history of Amsterdam is so rich and eventful that continuity is not much of a problem. There is a chronology of Hollands rulers and military commanders like William the Silent. There is the 80-year war with Spain and the burst of growth that followed. There is the legacy of religious persecution that may have made Amsterdam so famously tolerant though that argument hits a snag when it comes to Nazi occupation. Mr. Shorto who also has an eye for striking statistics points out the wide margin by which the Netherlands led Europe in the percentage of its Jews killed. As for religious tolerance today he cites two contrasting approaches to tensions between Islam and the West: the radical position of the outspoken Somali-Dutch feminist  Ayaan Hirsi Ali  and a two-man Muslim-Jewish team of leaders who tilt toward conciliation. Like any city built on idealism Amsterdam faces problems that elude easy resolution.         Of course Amsterdams most famous and tourist-friendly regulations involve prostitution and marijuana the lax marijuana laws prompting more quotable statistics. The book cites an assertion that 40.3 percent of Americans have used cannabis while only 22.6 of the Dutch who can use it legally have tried it. But Mr. Shorto does not compare marijuana use in for example Amsterdam with its hippie-hazy image with its use in The Hague. He does cite Dutch intolerance when it comes to both tobacco smoke and prescription drugs.         Other major sections in this enjoyably crowded book address eclectic Amsterdam architecture and the great importance of Dutch art. Mr. Shorto favors the trick of describing a young mans early history while withholding the fact that the young man is say Vincent van Gogh. But many of the stories he tells are about Dutch crusaders eccentrics and visionaries who are not well known to American readers. Amsterdam ought to change that.         In a book that easily fuses large cultural trends with intimately personal stories Mr. Shorto pays much attention to   Frieda Menco-Brommet  Anne Franks close childhood friend. He revisits her memories of the Frank family  and more originally writes of Ms. Menco-Brommets later life and her decision to live on the very block where her family had been brought after their hiding place was discovered and where her Auschwitz nightmare began. Ms. Menco-Brommets response to having this matter dredged up provides Amsterdam an unexpectedly lovely ending.         Mr. Shorto ultimately concludes that Amsterdam despite its spectacular history is a relatively poky place in todays era of global expansion. It is small in population he writes; in terms of geographic area you could tuck the whole of it into a corner of Shanghai or Karachi and it probably wouldnt be noticed. It has no skyscrapers. But the advantage of a modest skyline is the seemingly limitless horizon.

He demonstrates this repeatedly in The Wrong Mans his new spy-comedy series for the BBC and  Hulu . Air bag exploding in his face? Funny. Sobbing when told to throw away a new cellphone? Funny. (I dont want to go back to Nokia!) Looking both directions at an intersection in a getaway car? Funny.         Mr. Cordens comic persona  hangdog yet feverishly industrious both naÃ¯ve and witheringly sarcastic  is the engine driving The Wrong Mans (beginning Monday on Hulu) which he created with his co-star Mathew Baynton. As he did in his earlier series  Gavin & Stacey  Mr. Corden plays the sidekick who can be depended on to save the day despite having more heart than common sense. But where the dangers in Gavin & Stacey were strictly romantic in The Wrong Mans theyre mortal. Its hard to imagine another six-episode comedy with a higher body count.         The two stars play losers who work in the offices of a British county council. Mr. Corden is Phil the 31-year-old mail clerk; Mr. Baynton is Sam slightly higher up the food chain a noise guidance adviser whose ex-girlfriend has just been named his boss. Walking to work one morning Sam observes a car accident and then finds a cellphone beside the road events that plunge him and Phil into a dark spiraling farce that eventually encompasses kidnapping Chinese gamblers Russian mobsters a crooked development scheme and the British secret service. The shows ungainly title refers to the accidental nature of their involvement as well as their complete unsuitability for the job.         Sam and Phil are a typical comic duo: Sam thin neurotic and reluctant; Phil large enthusiastic and delusional. You cant put the genie back in the bottle Phil yells as he pushes Sam toward some new level of danger. Well of course you can Sam replies. Thats where the genie lives.         Mr. Baynton who appeared in another deft British comedy available on Hulu  Spy  is very funny in his own right and as The Wrong Mans goes along the focus shifts away from Phils energy and endless movie quotations to Sams budding heroism. Unfortunately this also signals a slight descent into Butch-and-Sundance buddy-movie clichÃ©s and feel-good affirmations. Phil is inevitably chewed out for his juvenility setting the stage for the inevitable redemptive big finish.         Mostly though The Wrong Mans coasts along on the strength of Mr. Corden Mr. Baynton and Tom Basdens sneaky-funny writing (You know what danger doesnt do? Call ahead. Unless its the I.R.A.) and the pleasure of watching Mr. Corden timidly but delightedly snorting drugs at a mobsters party or trying to blend in with a group of svelte dancers. A second season has  not   been announced but based on the obviousness of the cliffhanger that ends Season 1 it appears that everyone involved is expecting one to happen.

99,100000002544862,0,Article,Review,Arts,arts,music,Conductor and Orchestra Arrive Together,ZACHARY WOOLFE,1037,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/arts/music/at-cincinnati-symphony-louis-langrees-inaugural-weekend.html,1,CINCINNATI  You cannot become great if youre not willing to sacrifice Maya Angelou told the audience at Music Hall here on Friday evening an hour before she took the stage as the narrator in Coplands stirring Lincoln Portrait.         It was a sentiment that had particular resonance for the  Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra  which had invited Ms. Angelou to take part in the French conductor Louis LangrÃ©es inaugural concerts as the venerable ensembles 13th music director.         This is certainly an organization that has known greatness since its founding in 1895. The affable Mr. LangrÃ©e whose well-regarded work as music director of Lincoln Centers Mostly Mozart Festival brought him to Cincinnati for the first time just two years ago is the latest in a distinguished line that has included Leopold Stokowski Fritz Reiner Thomas Schippers and most recently Paavo JÃ¤rvi.         But the orchestra has also come to know sacrifice. Like many arts institutions it found that the economic recession created new problems as well as revealing existing ones including unsustainable deficits and a habit of raiding the endowment. ( Weve seen  how that movie ends.)         While similar troubles elsewhere resulted in contentious and continuing labor disputes Trey Devey who became the orchestras president early in 2009 finessed a 15 percent across-the-board budget cut including wage concessions.         This discreet move toward stability persuaded Louise Dieterle Nippert a Procter & Gamble heiress to create an $85 million fund that essentially pays for the Cincinnati Opera and Cincinnati Ballet which also perform in Music Hall to hire the orchestra as their house band. Coupled with the Orchestras Cincinnati Pops season and the choral-focused May Festival which grew out of the citys German singing societies the gift from Nippert who died in 2012 allowed the orchestra to continue a year-round schedule responsibly.         It was a saving grace that gave the ensemble breathing room to concentrate on expanding its repertory and building its audience as well as attracting a conductor like Mr. LangrÃ©e whose career has been on an upswing  including debuts with the Metropolitan Opera and the Berlin Philharmonic  since he was appointed to the Mostly Mozart position in 2002. In New York well liked by the musicians and brightly effusive on the podium  he spruced up the energy  of a group that had been flagging.         For his inaugural program in Cincinnati he deftly combined nods to the orchestras history the citys musical life and new music. Fridays concert opened with Jennifer Higdons On a Wire a sprightly chamber concerto composed in 2010 for the young sextet called eighth blackbird whose members did graduate study at the University of Cincinnatis College-Conservatory of Music.         It begins with the six soloists surrounding the open body of the piano pulling rosined fishing wire around certain strings to elicit haunting whalelike calls from them. The players eventually disperse to their own instruments but periodically return to the piano including for a slow passage in which the eerie calls alternate with nocturnal marimba colors over lyrical surges in the orchestra.         The muscle and emotion of Coplands Lincoln Portrait which was commissioned by the conductor AndrÃ© Kostelanetz and given its premiere by Kostelanetz and the Cincinnati Symphony in 1942 highlighted the ensembles characteristic sound: the different sections adroitly balanced and focused yet never harsh with bronzed burnished brasses infusing a strings section that plays with warm cohesive bite. Ms. Angelou brought her inimitable combination of majesty and folksiness to the speaking part drawn from Lincolns writings ferociously digging into the final words of the Gettysburg Address.         As if Beethovens Fifth Symphony required explanation or excuse it was featured in the orchestras first season back in 1895. Mr. LangrÃ©es brisk tight interpretation was reminiscent of many of his performances of the Classical repertory at Mostly Mozart: polished and impressively energetic if somehow weightless with movements that propelled forward without accumulating intensity. The ensemble played with fleet agility with particularly eloquent solos from the oboist Dwight Parry and the piccolo player Joan Voorhees her tone immaculate.         Mr. LangrÃ©e has thrown himself into life with the orchestra; buying a home in the city as he has is no longer a guarantee for globe-trotting music directors. In August he and the ensemble drew 35000 people over two performances to LumenoCity an outdoor concert and light show in Washington Park which faces Music Hall and was known for crime and drugs until recent efforts aimed at revitalizing it and the surrounding Over-the-Rhine neighborhood.         His next program featuring Mozart and Tchaikovsky is part of the orchestras One City One Symphony initiative a series of listening parties and outreach by the players and staff. He will conduct premieres by David Lang and Nico Muhly in March as part of the MusicNOW festival of new work founded in 2006 by the composer and guitarist Bryce Dessner.         It goes without saying that challenges remain. While salaries will soon return to their pre-2009 levels the financial woes affected hiring making new appointments one of Mr. LangrÃ©es most pressing priorities. The vast Music Hall is not a space that you want to attack with less than a full complement of players.         The hall built in 1878 in imposing red-brick Victorian Gothic Revival style is a mixed blessing a vital part of the ensembles identity but a struggle to fill except for major stars and special occasions like this weekend.         While average concert attendance has risen to 1900 from about 1550 in 2007  a 23 percent increase  thats in a hall that seats 3400. The acoustics are clear and the grand wide space retains a certain intimacy despite its size because there are more seats on the sides of the balcony levels than in many theaters. But barring a true overhaul the hall would at least benefit from a much-delayed renovation scheme that would trim capacity by increasing legroom.         In the meantime Mr. LangrÃ©e and the orchestras spirited music making will help fill the Gilded Age space. As striking as his conducting though was a passing moment on Friday: When intermission began he waited until Ms. Angelous wheelchair had been brought to her then walked offstage in her wake. No one would have remarked had he done differently but it was a gesture as classy as his artistry.         This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 13 2013 A music review on Monday about the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra whose program at Music Hall in Cincinnati included Lincoln Portrait by Aaron Copland referred incorrectly to the commission of that work. While the Cincinnati Symphony performed its premiere in 1942 it was commissioned by the conductor AndrÃ© Kostelanetz who conducted the premiere not by the orchestra.
100,100000002544817,0,Article,News,Technology,technology,,"To Grow, Twitter Looks Outside Its Own Walls",VINDU GOEL,1101,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/technology/to-grow-twitter-looks-to-wider-web-and-outside-developers.html,3,"SAN FRANCISCO  For  Twitter  to justify the high valuation of its stock the micro-messaging company must spread the gospel of tweeting far beyond its current active user base of 232 million accounts.         To do that Twitter is counting on millions of websites to link to the service and encouraging legions of independent developers to find creative new uses for its platform driving up activity and the number of advertisements that Twitter users see.         Joe Budzienski co-founder of  Gozaik  is among the developers trying to innovate on top of Twitters core service.         His start-up has developed a system that scans Twitters half-billion messages a day for job listings posted by employers indexes them and makes them easy for job seekers to search. It also builds profiles of Twitter users based on publicly available information that employers can look at to find candidates.         According to Gozaiks analysis 15 jobs are listed on Twitter every minute  roughly 150000 a week. One thing that is constant chatter on Twitter is jobs"" Mr. Budzienski said.         But matching those ads to potential employees is a challenge amid the cacophony that is the Twitter stream.         So besides the search engine on its own site Gozaik is developing an advertising tool that will let employers send job-related messages to specific users on Twitter who match their profile of an ideal candidate.         The system which is still in testing delivers the ads through Twitters existing real-time bidding platform. If it works it could lead to more job ads on Twitter and help the company tap into the robust market for employer services that has made LinkedIns career-oriented social network so profitable.         We believe that one thing we can bring to Twitter is an entire new ecosystem an entire new source of revenue said Mr. Budzienski adding that his companys experimentation has been approved by Twitter which is allowing Gozaik to have free access to all users tweets.         Other start-ups like Tame and Nuzzel are trying to improve on  the shortcomings of Twitters design  which presents messages in reverse chronological order regardless of significance.          Tame  a German company founded with financial support from the national government has built an alternative interface. Its tool which costs 5 euros a month analyzes a users feed and sorts posts into three columns  links topics and people  based primarily on how frequently they are mentioned.         If for example lots of people are discussing the latest revelations of spying by the National Security Agency those posts would bubble to the top. Users can also choose to examine their pool of tweets over one to 24 hours offering a quick way to catch up on the top messages over that time.         We believe something is important if lots of people talk about it said Torsten Mueller Tames co-founder and chief marketing officer who is temporarily working in an incubator space in the same building as Twitters headquarters in San Francisco. We offer you this instant analysis.         Twitter declined to make executives available for this article.         However the company generally supports this kind of innovation. It offers a host of free tools for outside sites and developers including  Twitter Cards  which allow publishers e-commerce sites and mobile applications to extend a 140-character tweet by adding photos previews of articles or links to mobile apps.         The feature is widely expected to be the basis for future Twitter services like video advertising or a way to buy a product directly from a tweet without leaving the site.         Beyond developers Twitter wants its messages republished and embedded on as many websites as possible and a team of employees led by the vice president for media Chloe Sladden work with news media broadcast outlets and the entertainment industry to integrate Twitter into their activities.         Posts about big news events like the passenger  David Euns photograph of the Asiana Airlines plane that crashed  in San Francisco in July often pop up in hundreds or even thousands of other places. That builds buzz about Twitter and exposes potential new users to the service.         They are one of the first technology companies to really approach media in a collaborative form said Ryan Osborn vice president for digital innovations and social media at NBC News. Were at a fascinating time in media where companies telling stories realize all these things are coming together so there is a symbiotic relationship.         In its prospectus for investors Twitter said that it did not make money directly from such deals but that increased use of its platform allowed it to show more ads.

101,100000002544781,0,Article,News,Crosswords & Games,crosswords,bridge,Two Advanced Books to Raise Your Game,PHILLIP ALDER,440,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/crosswords/bridge/two-advanced-books-to-raise-your-game.html,4,Among the advanced books published this year were Fantunes Revealed by Bill Jacobs and The Thin Fine Line by Neil Kimelman (both from Master Point Press).          I was surprised when the International Bridge Press Association gave its book-of-the-year award to Jacobs who explains the unusual bidding system employed by Fulvio Fantoni and Claudio Nunes. They were born in Italy but now represent Monaco and are the worlds two top-ranked players.         It is a great system with among other things unlimited one-level suit opening bids but it contains many artificial relay sequences and takes a lot of learning. There are also several deals taken from tournaments featuring Fantunes as well as Jacobs and his partner Ben Thompson. Both are Australian.         My concern about the award is that this book will have a limited market.         The one by Kimelman a Canadian is a sequel to his Improve Your Bidding Judgment. He gives a lot of practical advice for tournament players while expanding on his first book adding lots of new material.         One of my favorite conventions is the fit-bid especially in competitive auctions. An unusual jump shows length and strength in the bid suit and support for partners suit. This allows a partner to judge the combined values very well. Double fits are delicious; misfits are miserable. (The only splinter bid I play in competition is a jump cue-bid. For example if the opener bids one heart and the next player overcalls one spade responders jump-cue of three spades is a splinter bid; but a jump response of four clubs or four diamonds is a fit-bid.)         Kimelman includes the diagramed deal in his book taken from the 2010 dOrsi Senior Bowl world championship. Over Norths takeout double East makes a four-club fit-jump announcing long clubs heart support and a willingness to try for (at least) 10 tricks in hearts. When South advances with four spades I think there is a good case for Wests doubling. He has a trump honor an ace and most important a singleton in his partners suit. But if he passes East will double.         Against four spades doubled West leads his club. The defenders will take one spade one heart and two clubs for down one plus 200.         At the table West erred badly by bidding five hearts. He was doubled and lost one spade two diamonds and a diamond ruff for down two minus 300.         Fit-jumps occur in one other important position: by a passed-hand responder. For example you pass partner opens one heart and you respond two spades. This is a fit-jump. The textbook example is a maximum pass five respectable spades and four decent hearts.                Also in T Magazine »       
102,100000002544851,0,Article,Review,Arts,arts,design,The Remnants of a Culture’s Heart and Soul,EDWARD ROTHSTEIN,1207,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/arts/design/iraqi-jewish-documents-at-the-national-archives.html,1,WASHINGTON  These are not the weapons of mass destruction that the American Mobile Exploitation Team Alpha was seeking in Iraq during the spring of 2003. But the books and manuscripts that the team found in a flooded basement of Saddam Husseins secret police headquarters  now on display for the first time at the National Archives here  look like victims of some form of ordnance.         They are ragged warped torn stained. And that is after extensive restoration. This new  exhibition  Discovery and Recovery: Preserving Iraqi Jewish Heritage presents just 24 artifacts (and some reproductions) selected from 2700 volumes and tens of thousands of documents  the American military found submerged  in four feet of fetid water in the Mukhabarat Iraqs intelligence building. Those items which had been collected by the Iraqi office investigating Israel and the Jews span five centuries of Jewish life in Iraq. It took weeks for the American team to gather them set them out to dry and ship them  in disarray and black with mold  to the National Archives. Much still awaits being  restored  and digitized at the archives laboratories in College Park Md.         Their condition though may be the least complicated thing about them. The flooding was caused by an unexploded coalition bomb  an accident of war. The mold was partly the result of the military rescuers inability to freeze the waterlogged material immediately which would have halted decay. The costs of the restoration overseen by the archives director of preservation  Doris Hamburg  have been mainly paid with $3 million from the State Department which will return the materials to Iraq next year  as was agreed.         But that plan has touched a quivering nerve. Protests have been registered by Senator Charles E.  Schumer  of New York a Democrat and other members of Congress;  Iraqi Jews  now in other countries have also been  pressing for alternatives  to the collections return. Passions are high too because the collections state of ruin is an uncanny representation of what happened to the Iraqi Jewish population itself. It had been the oldest Jewish diaspora in the world arriving before the sixth century B.C. In 1940 Jews accounted for a quarter of Baghdads population; there were more than 130000 Jews in Iraq.  Now there is scarcely a handful .         So these documents which are  gradually being made available online  offer a wide-ranging requiem. On display is a 16th-century Hebrew Bible and a students 1967 transcript from a Jewish school in Baghdad. There is a 1793 volume of the Babylonian Talmud and an 1815 copy of the Zohar a mystical text.         But this cache really should not be called the Iraqi Jewish Archive as the National Archives refers to it. That title implies a systematic collection. Actually as is clear online it is a miscellaneous assemblage of treasures and trivia incorporating legal documents and prayer books office correspondence and Hebrew calendars. What then was it doing in the intelligence services basement? And what will be its fate?         Historians have yet to explore these materials fully but the impression from the exhibition and from surveying the 2000 documents online is that very little intelligence was involved in this gathering of intelligence. It seems as if items were  indiscriminately taken  from every variety of Jewish institution. Dissertations newspapers textbooks rabbinical literature and telephone books were pulled from hospitals schools community organizations libraries. We may be seeing a classic anti-Semitic doctrine at work: the belief that the very transmission of Hebrew texts is evidence of a dangerous cabal.         Items in the collection may have also been seized for psychological effect as suggested by  Harold Rhode  a Pentagon analyst and an adviser on Islamic affairs for the secretary of defense from 1995 to 2010 who was present at the caches discovery and instrumental in its rescue. In  an online account  Mr. Rhode argues that part of this collection moved with the shrinking Jewish population until it was stored at the last synagogue in Baghdad. In 1984 Mr. Hussein carted away the cache; the purpose Mr. Rhode suggests was to humiliate the citys remaining Jews.         This exhibition illustrates how far they had already fallen. The rare centuries-old volumes on view testify to a Jewish community that was once worldly enough to afford such texts yet keen to study them feeding on a spiritual tradition of fervor and seriousness. As this show reminds us the Iraq region is where the tombs of Daniel Ezekiel Ezra and Jonah are found where the Babylonian Talmud was compiled and where great Jewish academies were established in the first millennium.         We see too that Iraqi Jews were often prosperous despite their secondary status under Islamic rule. In the 20th century some Iraqi Jewish businesses became international. (There is a 1920 letter from David Sassoon & Company in Bombay.)         It is tantalizing to learn that the military team was initially told that a seventh-century Babylonian Talmud was in the cache; it was never found but  important items were looted .         The salvation of the rest was as unpredictable as its presence in that basement. The extraordinary efforts required (supported by Donald H. Rumsfeld then defense secretary) may have salved the consciences of those in the United States administration who failed to stop the torching of  the great Central Library in Baghdad  a few weeks earlier.         As for the Jewish populations decline perhaps the collection will eventually shed light on the massacres hangings expulsions and degradations that befell its members beginning in the 1930s. But the exhibitions text provides a broad portrait. Nazis and their Islamic allies began making inroads culminating in the Farhud pogrom in 1941; the exhibition says 180 Jews were killed and hundreds more injured; other estimates are higher. Later that decade Iraqs entry in the war against Israel led to edicts removing Jews from public life and imposing restrictions on their commerce and travel. Mass migrations followed requiring forfeiture of property.         Some sense of the delicate maneuvering required by the remaining Jews in Iraqi is clear here in a 1949 Hebrew primer. Two pages with a poem declaring loyalty to King Faisal II were ripped out after he was killed in a military coup in July 1958. It is as if mixed feelings of loyalty and vulnerability first required including the pledge and then required destroying it.         Difficulties mounted again with the 1963 rise of the Baath Party. And Islamist attacks in recent years have not inspired confidence about returning this collection. What evidence is there that Iraq will now treasure artifacts of Jews and other cultures? How would this archive be freely studied? Since these documents were forcefully taken from the Jews of Iraq was the 2003 State Department agreement even valid? But if they belonged to that population who are its rightful heirs? Iraqi Jews now living in other countries?         The one thing that is clear is that this textual trace of a communitys life is not a backwater chronicle. The exhibition reminds us that while the Wests influence on Judaism has been profound it is by the waters of Babylon that many texts and practices of exilic Judaism were codified beginning a long evolutionary journey  even if this strand came to a grievous end in the muck of Iraqs Mukhabarat.         Discovery and Recovery: Preserving Iraqi Jewish Heritage runs through Jan. 5 at the National Archives Constitution Avenue at Ninth Street NW Washington; archives.gov.

103,100000002542003,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,international,Service Sector Gaining Steam in Chinese Economy,BETTINA WASSENER,1108,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/international/service-sector-gaining-steam-in-chinas-economy.html,2,HONG KONG  China long the worlds factory is becoming more service-oriented.         Sports apparel retailers like Li Ning Anta Sports Products and 361 Degrees International have thousands of stores around the country. The Alibaba Group founded in 1999  has swelled into an e-commerce giant  with more than 20000 employees and sales of $1.7 billion in the second quarter of this year. And Tencent which runs Web portals and chat services has a market value of nearly $100 billion.         This is Chinas economy growing up maturing into a state where services play an increasing role as the population grows richer. Chinas services sector has been growing steadily and  nonmanufacturing activity   now accounts for about as large a percentage of the economy as the manufacturing sector  about 45 percent. (The remainder is agriculture.)         The development is being encouraged by the policy makers who are gathering in Beijing this week for a four-day meeting on how to overhaul Chinas economy. Their goal is to reduce the dominance of heavy industry manufacturing and investment in infrastructure which for decades were the driving forces of Chinas sizzling growth.         They have aimed to diversify the economy and foster more productive growth by raising the share of activity generated by the service sector which spans areas as diverse as logistics tourism engineering health care and information technology.         The direction is pretty clear said Jian Chang the China economist at the British bank Barclays. They want to invigorate the service sector which they see as a key source of future growth.         Chinas service sector is still small in percentage terms compared with those of Britain and the United States where a vast array of services makes up almost 80 percent of the economy. But the  sector has about doubled  its share of the Chinese economy since 1980 according to the World Bank.         The rebalancing of the economy Ms. Chang said is already underway.         The swing has been driven largely by three decades of rapid economic growth that have left many of Chinas 1.3 billion inhabitants able to spend more money well beyond necessities. Much of this extra spending power has gone into cars and refrigerators. But it has also fanned demand for movies better health care meals at fast-food restaurants education and tutoring.         Manufacturing will remain a key pillar of the economy but at the margin future growth will come from the services industry said Wang Tao the economist for China at UBS. As people get richer they want more quality of life.         More recently the economic turmoil in the West has accentuated the shift by undermining demand for the toys shoes machinery and other goods that are churned out by the countrys export-dependent manufacturing sector. At the same time the new leaderships eagerness to rein in the excess capacities that plague parts of the Chinese economy has hit sectors like steel making.         Business surveys produced by the national statistics bureau have highlighted this divergence in recent months. While the index measuring activity in the  manufacturing sector  has been languishing for the past year the nonmanufacturing index has held up relatively well.         The  October reading  released this month came in at 56.3. A reading above 50 signals expansion.         One of the biggest beneficiaries of this spending power is the tourism sector which has exploded as Chinas middle class has embraced domestic and foreign travel. Visitor numbers at the Great Wall the karst mountains around Guilin and the seaside resorts of the island of Hainan have soared in recent years as have the flights hotels and bars that cater to travelers.         Air China one of the countrys largest airlines now carries more than twice as many passengers per month than it did five years ago.         Other areas have also grown.         International Sunshine Home a day care center for children which opened in the southeastern city of Xiamen in 2010 recently opened a second branch and is aiming to add one new branch a year over the next few years.         The education sector is fairly recession-resistant said David Powell principal of the daycare center. Our customers think of education as an essential service.         The flurry of activity is positive not just from the point of view of rebalancing the economy but also from the perspective of job creation economists say.         Already  service sector companies employ more  people in China than manufacturers. And the jobs generated by logistics centers hotels software companies and airlines tend to be not just numerous but also generally more suited to the millions who graduate from high schools and universities every year and who are reluctant to take jobs on factory assembly lines.         What is unclear analysts say is how fast the growth of the services sector will continue to be.         Lucy Chen contributed research from Beijing.

105,100000002544904,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,football,Defense Lifts Giants Over Raiders and to a Third Straight Win,BILL PENNINGTON,1012,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/sports/football/defense-lifts-giants-over-raiders-and-to-a-third-straight-win.html,1,EAST RUTHERFORD N.J.  Andre Brown and Terrell Thomas had become ghosts on the Giants roster faintly tethered to the team by a rehabilitation schedule and a weight-room regimen.         Giants Close-Up KEY PLAY/PERFORMANCE NUMBER OF THE WEEK: 19 TALKING POINT  - BILL PENNINGTON They were the hard-luck twins two Giants who could not catch a break.         A year ago Brown a journeyman running back was having the season of his life when he broke his left leg. This summer returning as one of the Giants featured backs he broke the leg again.         Thomas a gifted cornerback and perhaps the Giants best defensive player three years ago tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during the 2011 preseason. A year later he did it again.         But Sunday in a fitting representation of the teams nascent revival after a 0-6 start it was Brown and Thomas who rescued the Giants preventing a humiliating home defeat.         Browns gritty determined running  he had a career-high 30 carries  bailed out a sloppy Giants offense. On the opposite side of the ball Thomas intercepted a pass that led to the go-ahead second-half touchdown as the Giants turned back the pesky  Oakland Raiders  for a crude if imperative 24-20 victory.         The third consecutive victory keeps the Giants in the N.F.C. East playoff chase and throughout the Giants locker room Sunday night Brown and Thomas were being feted as the inspiration for a team that has not quit.         Everyone in this room has seen those two guys get knocked down and knocked down again safety Antrel Rolle said but they just kept getting back up.         Defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka added It made everyone believe in the strength of willpower.         Brown who rushed for 115 yards in his first regular-season game in roughly 50 weeks was moving slowly after the game with a hand pressed to a sore back. Told of his statistics Sunday he said: I had 30 carries? It felt like 50.         Brown who scored on a 1-yard run and whose dependable rushing on third down kept several Giants drives alive was a 2009 Giants draft pick but ruptured his left Achilles tendon in a preseason practice that year.         If I looked back and dwelled on all the injuries Ive had he said I wouldnt be here. But if you look around lots of players are struggling with injuries and fighting through it. I look to them as motivation.         Thomas was one of the players Brown had in mind. We have a mutual respect for one another Thomas said of Brown. Thomass interception was the turning point of a game the Raiders led by 20-14 in the third quarter. On the Giants sideline at the beginning of the second half Thomas had barked at his defensive teammates that they needed to cause a turnover.         He was right. The Giants offense was sputtering. In the final minutes of the first half  Eli Manning  had thrown an interception that was returned for a touchdown his third such misplay this season.         The Giants needed a lift. Oakland shifted into a passing formation that Thomas recognized. In practice last week the Giants scout team had run the same play mimicking Oaklands tendencies and Thomas anticipating where the ball would be thrown had intercepted a pass and returned it for a touchdown.         On Sunday watching things play out exactly as he had seen it in practice Thomas snatched the pass from Oakland quarterback Terrelle Pryor and started running for the end zone. Unlike at practice Thomass return was interrupted as he was brought down at the Raiders 5. But it set up Browns touchdown run and gave the Giants a 21-20 lead.         That lead was preserved largely by Brown who rushed for 44 yards in the fourth quarter setting up a field goal and killing the clock in the final minutes. Manning who completed 12 of 22 passes for 140 yards was having another off day throwing the football and Browns steady bursts up the middle were a welcome sight.         Perseverance does pay off and Andre is a guy who has persevered Coach Tom Coughlin said.         Defensively the Giants were impressive for another week and not just because of Thomass interception. In the last 14 quarters of play the Giants defense has given up one touchdown  and that was hardly its fault. It occurred Sunday shortly after the opening sequence of the game.         The Giants lost the opening kickoff as returner Jerrel Jernigan had the ball knocked from his hands. It was grabbed out of the air by Oaklands Andre Holmes who ran down the right sideline until he was pushed out at the 5.         Two plays later Pryor scored on a quarterback sneak. Less than a minute into the game the Giants were trailing 7-0.         The Giants regained some equilibrium and took a 14-10 lead. But late in the first half Manning inexplicably hurried a pass toward Victor Cruz even though Oakland cornerback Tracy Porter was between Manning and Cruz.         Porters 43-yard interception return for a touchdown gave Oakland the lead. Then the third quarter began with a long Raiders drive. Oakland had a first down at the Giants 1 and appeared poised to take a 10-point lead. But the Giants defense held turning back the Raiders on three successive plays and forcing them to settle for a field goal.         A huge stop Coughlin said.         Next for the Giants who are a third of the way through a three-game homestand will be the banged-up Green Bay Packers. The Giants have still not defeated a winning team and they continue to make costly mistakes  they turned the ball over three times and had a punt blocked.         But when the miscues mounted earlier in the season or when Manning had a pass intercepted and returned for a touchdown those were the kind of games the Giants lost. For the moment the Giants are discovering inspiration from within and feel buoyed by their three-game winning streak.         Weve been finding ways to win in the fourth quarter Manning said. And with some new faces and help here and there were coming together as a team.                Also in Video »       
106,100000002544155,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,,Supreme Court to Take Up Challenges to Union Practices,STEVEN GREENHOUSE,1314,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/supreme-court-to-take-up-challenges-to-union-practices.html,1,Labor leaders and businesses are closely watching a Supreme Court case to be argued this Wednesday that involves a popular strategy used by unions to successfully organize hundreds of thousands of workers.         That strategy  widely deployed by the Service Employees International Union and the Unite Here hotel workers union  involves pressuring an employer into signing a so-called neutrality agreement in which the employer promises not to oppose a unionization drive. By some estimates more than half of the recent successful unionization campaigns involve such agreements which sometimes allow union organizers onto company property to talk with workers.         Benjamin Sachs a professor of labor law at Harvard Law School said the case before the Supreme Court was potentially the most significant labor case in a generation.         Professor Sachs said that if the court ruled against labor it could significantly hobble efforts by private sector unions to organize workers. He added that the other big labor case the Supreme Court has agreed to hear this session could have a significant impact on public sector unions. In that case a home-care worker has asked the court to rule that the state of Illinois violated her First Amendment rights by requiring her to pay fair share fees much like dues to a union she did not support.         In the case being argued on Wednesday  Unite Here Local 355 vs. Mulhall  an employee of Mardi Gras Gaming in Florida sued Unite Here asserting that its neutrality agreement with the company was illegal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled in his favor finding that the agreement was a thing of value that federal labor law bars employers from giving to any union or union official.         Unite Here appealed urging the Supreme Court to overturn the Eleventh Circuit and instead embrace rulings of the Third and Fourth Circuits which have held that such agreements were not illegal things of value.         Karen Harned executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business Small Business Legal Center which filed a supporting brief with the Supreme Court applauded the Eleventh Circuit and denounced neutrality agreements asserting that they are the type of improper thing of value that employers are prohibited from giving to unions.         A lot of small employers dont have the resources to fight back if theyre the subject of a union campaign to get them to sign a neutrality agreement she said. We are concerned that neutrality agreements are nothing more than extortion. The way theyre being used by unions the unions say We promise not to trash your reputation or do X Y Z if you sign this agreement.'         The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation which helped the Mardi Gras employee Martin Mulhall bring the case said another prevalent union tactic  in which unions get employers to agree to use card check rather than a secret ballot election to determine whether a majority of workers want a union  should also be considered an illegal thing of value. With card check union organizers ask workers to sign cards saying they support a union and if a majority of workers sign them the union presents the cards to the employer so the employer will recognize the union.         As part of its neutrality agreement Mardi Gras Gaming agreed to permit card check. In exchange Unite Here pledged to back a casino gambling ballot initiative spending more than $100000 on the effort and not to picket or strike Mardi Gras during its unionization drive.         Craig Becker general counsel of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said the Right to Work groups legal theory to bar such agreements would criminalize a large swath of ordinary voluntary labor-management relations.         Under their theory Mr. Becker said parties cannot agree to this the employer cant give it unilaterally and the union cant even ask for it. The implications are really sweeping.        
107,100000002544863,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,,Texas and 5 Other States Resist Processing Benefits for Gay Couples,RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.,1045,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/us/texas-and-5-other-states-resist-processing-benefits-for-gay-couples.html,12,On the morning of Sept. 3 the first day the Pentagon said they could Alicia Butler and her wife Judith Chedville who is a Texas Army National Guard officer went to Austins Camp Mabry so Ms. Butler could get a military spouse identification card and register for the same federal marriage benefits provided to wives and husbands of heterosexual service members.         The two women handed a sheaf of official papers including their 2008 California marriage license to a clerk who glanced at the documents and declared Its one of those. She then called over her boss who told the couple that they would have to travel to a federal military base like Fort Hood 70 miles to the north to get the ID Ms. Butler recalled.         The reason: Texas is one of six states refusing to comply with Defense Secretary  Chuck Hagel s order that gay spouses of National Guard members be given the same federal marriage benefits as heterosexual spouses. Mr. Hagels decree which applies to all branches of the military followed the Supreme Courts ruling in June that struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act that had prohibited the federal government from recognizing  same-sex marriages .         While a majority of states ban same-sex marriages most are not fighting the new policy. But Pentagon officials say that in addition to Texas Georgia Louisiana Mississippi Oklahoma and West Virginia have balked. Each has cited a conflict with state laws that do not recognize same-sex marriages. (A West Virginia official said however that the state intended to follow the directive.) While the president has the power to call National Guard units into federal service  and nearly all Guard funding comes from the federal government  the states say the units are state agencies that must abide by state laws.         Requiring same-sex Guard spouses to go to federally owned bases protects the integrity of our state Constitution and sends a message to the federal government that they cannot simply ignore our laws or the will of the people Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma said last week.         But the six states are violating federal law Mr. Hagel told an audience recently. It causes division among the ranks and it furthers prejudice he said. Mr. Hagel has demanded full compliance but Pentagon officials have not said what steps they would take with states that do not fall in line.         Though the government does not keep official figures on same-sex marriages in the military the  American Military Partner Association  which advocates for gay service members estimates that the number could be 1000 or more of the nearly half-million National Guard members nationwide said Chris Rowzee a spokeswoman for the group.         The military grants a range of significant benefits to the spouses of active-duty guardsmen including the right to enroll in the militarys health insurance program and to obtain a higher monthly housing allowance. Spouse IDs allow unescorted access to bases with their lower-priced commissaries.         Officials in the six states say they are not preventing same-sex spouses from getting benefits because those couples can register and receive IDs through federal bases. But those officials conceded that many couples would have to travel hours round trip to the nearest federal installation. Advocates for gay service members though fear that some benefits offered on bases like support services for relatives of deployed service members could still be blocked.         Moreover gay spouses say that in an age that saw the scrapping of the militarys ban on openly gay service members it is discriminatory  and humiliating  to have to jump through extra hoops to receive benefits.         Ms. Butler a plaintiffs lawyer in Austin has had to navigate other tricky legal rules during her relationship with Ms. Chedville who is now a first lieutenant in the Texas Army National Guard and works as a civilian nurse in Austin.         After they started dating Ms. Chedville deployed to Iraq in 2003 to help repair air bases but the women had to keep quiet about their relationship because the ban known as Dont Ask Dont Tell was still law. Five years later they went to California to get married before a state referendum  Proposition 8  banned same-sex marriages. (Proposition 8 was later overturned.)         Ms. Butler is critical of state officials who say they are causing only a minor inconvenience because all the same-sex spouses have to do is travel to a federal base. The reasoning behind that notion she said was similar to that of the Southern states that once required separate  but what state officials then insisted were equal  water fountains and bathrooms.         Sometimes its about the indignities you make people go through Ms. Butler said. Its a petty way to score political points.         Aides to Gov.  Rick Perry  who is not running for re-election but has not ruled out another presidential bid in 2016 told the commander of the Texas Military Forces (the states National Guard) that his is a state agency and as such is obligated to adhere to the Texas Constitution and the laws of this state which clearly define marriage as being between one man and one woman said Josh Havens a Perry spokesman.         The state Guard commander Maj. Gen. John F. Nichols wants to support all his soldiers and treat them all equally and fairly but he cannot break state law said his spokeswoman Lt. Col. Joanne MacGregor who serves in the Texas Army National Guard. She said at least 20 federal installations in Texas were processing the benefits while Camp Mabry and four other Guard bases on state property were not.         General Nichols has asked the state attorney general Greg Abbott to issue an opinion on whether there is a way to adhere to Mr. Hagels demand. Mr. Abbott a Republican vying to succeed Mr. Perry next year may not issue an opinion for some months. According to early polls Mr. Abbotts toughest challenge next year is likely to be in the general election against State Senator Wendy Davis a Democrat who has supported equal treatment of gay people in the workplace.         If Mr. Abbott rules that state officials are allowed to issue IDs to same-sex Guard couples would Mr. Perry let General Nichols proceed? Mr. Havens the Perry spokesman said they would cross that bridge later.                Also in Video »       
108,100000002544839,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,basketball,"To Win Now, Nets Take Time to Learn What Works",BECKLEY MASON,834,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/sports/basketball/to-win-now-nets-take-time-to-learn-what-works.html,7, Jason Kidd  is taking the long view on  the Nets  supposed short window. Teams with rosters as old and expensive as the Nets $103.1 million collection of battle-tested veterans are often said to be in win now mode. But for the Nets who dropped to 2-5 with Saturday nights 102-97 loss to the Indiana Pacers now does not refer as much to this moment as it does to spring 2014.         The absence of urgency is evident in how little the Nets stars have played. Last season four Nets averaged more than 30 minutes a game with Deron Williams and Joe Johnson averaging more than 36 a night. So far this season only Brook Lopez is averaging 30.1 minutes a game; everyone else is playing fewer than 30. No other team in the league has such an even distribution of minutes which may explain the Nets disappointing start.         It is a simple thing but winning is difficult when your best players cannot play a lot of minutes.         Kidds minute-limiting logic is clear though. Kevin Garnett is 37 Paul Pierce is 36 and Williams is still recovering from an ankle injury. Kidd a Knick last season knows firsthand the value of regular-season rest.         But the Nets have started ramping up the workload for their formidable starting crew. On Saturday against the Pacers the last undefeated team in the N.B.A. four Nets played more than 32 minutes in an intense physical contest that came down to a few possessions in the fourth quarter.         Given Williamss absence through the training camp and the preseason it is no surprise that the Nets offensive chemistry has been a matter of experiment. Against the Pacers as has been the case throughout the season the Nets rarely generated more than a couple of passes on each offensive possession. The attack has been deliberate with the ball often staying on one side of the court as the Nets work through a simple play.         This style has led to a significant drop in 3-point attempts each game. Although Williams who led the team in 3-point attempts last season has played limited minutes 3-pointers also come when rapid ball movement keeps the defense scrambling.         Kidd and Williams opened the playbook more in the fourth quarter Saturday revealing some of the clever actions possible with this versatile and skilled roster. One especially effective play had Lopez and Pierce setting a double high screen for Williams. Corralling Williams without losing a huge roll man like Lopez or a shooter like Pierce stretched even the league-leading Pacers defense beyond the breaking point. The Nets got two fourth-quarter layups using the play.         Such moments nourish hope for the Nets even as they made a number of costly mental errors in the fourth quarter.         Lopezs play also raises expectations. The only Net who is just now entering his prime he is one of the N.B.A.s most effective post players. Lopez benefits from better passers this season but he is still learning how to work with Garnett on defense. There are moments in each game when Garnett seems to think Lopez will be in a different position to help and the Nets then give up an easy basket. Optimists believe those slip-ups will be eliminated by the time the playoffs arrive.         One positive has been the play of the bench notably Andrei Kirilenko the backup point guard Shaun Livingston and the scrappy rookie Mason Plumlee. The Nets will need that depth when one of their older or injury-prone players is out for a stretch of the regular season.         Beneath the updated look the Nets will go only as far as Williams can guide them. For the Nets to capitalize on all the new shooting and skill on the roster Williams needs to have that killer burst the special verve of a point guard who is in control of the offense. He needs to blow past his defender in transition and be the high-energy engine of the squad. It may take more than a week or two for him to find his form.         So it is too early to judge the Nets. Not only have we yet to see much of the team that will be on the floor at the end of the year but the Nets are also still figuring out what works and how to repeatedly do it.         The older Boston teams of Garnett and Pierce were slow starters. The Celtics began the 2011-12 season losing nine of their first 14 games before almost making the N.B.A. finals.         After Saturdays game Garnett was philosophical about the future. I dont think you put a timetable on something that youre trying to get perfection he said. Youre trying to cut down on mistakes and youre trying to form chemistry and youre trying to be consistent with that.         The Nets know winning now is less important than building to a peak sometime in May 2014. But that does not change how a tough loss feels in November.         It is frustrating Garnett said.                Also in Video »       
109,100000002544818,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,basketball,"For Knicks, a Slow Start and a Bad Ending",SCOTT CACCIOLA,847,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/sports/basketball/for-knicks-a-slow-start-and-a-bad-ending.html,7,As fans began drifting to the exits many of those who stayed  a mix of masochists and die-hards  did so purely for the chance to voice their displeasure.         Over the next hour as the  Knicks  began the slow painful post-mortem of Sundays 120-89 loss to the  San Antonio Spurs  Coach Mike Woodson questioned his teams pride. Carmelo Anthony used the word embarrassing. Metta World Peace hinted at conflicts that needed resolution.         Its things that even if anybody wanted to say something wed never say to you guys World Peace said. We would never tell the public.         It was a glum scene at Madison Square Garden as the Knicks (2-4) plunged to new depths amid their well-established early-season struggles: no defense no offense no rebounding no chance. Certainly not against the Spurs (6-1) long one of the leagues most successful and stable franchises.         The Spurs do not squander big leads. They do not make foolish mistakes. They do not lose focus not even during sleepy matinees in November. So the contrast between the two franchises was clear from the start as the Spurs in building a 37-point lead took the liberty of humiliating the Knicks on their home court.         We didnt compete tonight and thats just unacceptable Woodson said.         At this time last year the Knicks were undefeated and racing their way to a 54-win season. The Garden was abuzz. The games were parties.         Those days are gone as are several veterans  including Jason Kidd  whose collective value now seems apparent. The Knicks lacked cohesion even before Tyson Chandler broke his right leg last week and their situation grew so bleak that they staged a players-only meeting before Fridays win over the Charlotte Bobcats.         The Spurs are not the Bobcats however and the Knicks needed more than a meeting to match San Antonios size and experience.         I understood what we were up against tonight said World Peace who finished with 13 points and 5 rebounds off the bench. They were throwing some nice little wrinkles at these young fellas that they never saw before. Its just about getting better.         The Spurs shot 53.9 percent and outrebounded the Knicks 51-33 as Danny Green scored 24 points and sank 6 of 9 attempts from 3-point range. Tim Duncan collected 11 points and 10 rebounds and Tony Parker filleted the Knicks defense for 17 points and 6 assists.         Anthony led the Knicks with 16 points and 8 rebounds but often found himself double-teamed by defenders whenever he touched the ball. That second defender was sometimes Duncan who used his pterodactyl-like wingspan to obstruct Anthonys vision and limit him to 10 field-goal attempts.         The Spurs did everything right Anthony said. They did everything they wanted to do out there on the court.         The Knicks on the other hand played something that only vaguely resembled professional basketball. The damage began to accumulate in the games opening minutes. There was the Spurs Marco Belinelli buzzing past Raymond Felton along the 3-point arc and encountering zero defensive help en route to a layup and a 10-0 lead.         Early in the third quarter the Knicks Iman Shumpert pulled away for a fast-break layup that bounced off the rim before falling away. At the other end Green drained another 3-pointer. The lead was back to 22 and Woodson adopted a familiar pose: arms crossed his face contorted in a grimace.         Woodson said he was disappointed that his players had let their miscues on offense dictate how they played defense which meant not playing much defense at all.         Thats a bad combination when you do that Woodson said.         J. R. Smith the N.B.A.s reigning sixth man of the year made his first appearance of the season after serving a five-game suspension for violating the leagues drug policy. A warm greeting from the crowd devolved into jeers as Smith went 1 of 9 from the field with four turnovers.         The Knicks have lacked continuity this season. No chemistry. Little flow. Woodson acknowledged the challenge of reintroducing Smith to the lineup while attempting to make up for the loss of Chandler. Against the Spurs it was an impossible task.         We will figure it out said Anthony who used some version of that phrase eight times in a five-minute session with the news media. I have to remain very confident very positive in this locker room and hopefully my teammates feed off of that.         He added: If Im in here being negative then theyre going to be in here being negative and moping around and the morale is down. We cant have that not right now.         San Antonio seems to hold itself to a different standard. Before the game Coach Gregg Popovich graded his teams early-season performance: Were playing C-plus B-minus basketball right now. He rattled off the ways the Spurs could improve: transition defense ball movement weakside help rebounding.         How then to explain his teams success?         Good fortune Popovich said. Corporate knowledge. Theyre older than dirt; they know what theyre doing.         They left the Garden after showing just how much the Knicks still had to learn.                Also in Video »       
110,100000002544762,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,soccer,Cosmos Rewind: Champions Again,JACK BELL,483,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/sports/soccer/cosmos-rewind-champions-again.html,,"Most of their current players were not born the last time the New York Cosmos won a championship 31 years ago.         The names of the clubs cavalcade of international stars of yesteryear are merely names to the current generation. A glorious history that is both stirring and an impossible act to follow.         But Saturday night before a crowd of 7211 in Atlanta a collection of players wearing the green and white of the Cosmos set about writing their own story in a new North American Soccer League. The Cosmos the leagues fall champion defeated the Atlanta Silverbacks the spring champion to win Soccer Bowl 13 1-0 on a stunning goal by the former Spanish international Marcos Senna.         Its an exciting day for sure Cosmos Coach Giovanni Savarese said after the game. The New York Cosmos are back; we worked very hard this season to play in the N.A.S.L. We had to come in in the second part the fall season so we didnt have that much time to work. We are very proud very proud of the players because they accomplished great things. Week in week out they were able to do very well and tonight to bring a championship back to New York something that hasnt happened since 1982 is a proud moment for us.         Savarese and the rebooted Cosmos playing in the second tier of soccer in the United States built a roster around Senna who was clearly the class of the team and of the league. The team (10-1-4) lost only one game during the fall season and imposed its will on the Silverbacks on Saturday night controlling possession and the tempo of the match.         The Cosmos were in control in the first half but failed to finish a handful of chances. They broke the scoreless deadlock in the 50th minute.         Ayoze 27 a left wing from Spain who had a strong game took a free kick from 25 yards out that was cleared by the Atlanta defense. Senna lurked just outside the penalty area. He calmly controlled the ball with his thigh before gently stroking a dipping shot that found the top corner inside the far post.         Its difficult for me to say exactly the way the goal went in "" Senna said. What I can say is that it was a moment of happiness.         The championship is the sixth N.A.S.L. title in the history of the club but the first since the Cosmos defeated the Seattle Sounders 1-0 in Soccer Bowl 82 in San Diego. The current incarnation of the N.A.S.L. began in 2011.         Next up for the Cosmos will be a trip to Spain to play in Sennas testimonial match against his old club team Villarreal on Wednesday. The club is also planning a postseason trip to Bermuda and a preseason excursion to the United Arab Emirates for a tournament (Emirates Airlines is the clubs jersey sponsor).

111,100000002544800,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,soccer,"With Victory Over Arsenal, United Shows Its Mettle",ROB HUGHES,1018,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/sports/soccer/with-victory-over-arsenal-united-shows-its-mettle.html,2, Manchester United  is heading back toward the top of the  Premier League  it won last season. The change of team management after so many years and the march of  Arsenal  through the opening two months of the campaign had suggested a tough transition for the champion.         We knew that we couldnt afford to lose today said Wayne Rooney immediately after the result. We knew we had to do a job and we managed to do that. It was as tough as anything weve faced this season.         But with Sundays 1-0 win by United over Arsenal almost inevitably through a goal by Robin van Persie the gap at the top is closing and United has served notice that it is far from ready to abdicate.         Englands top fixture this may be but as the teams lined up to observe the traditional salute on Remembrance Sunday no fewer than 11 different nations were represented by the players linking arms around the center circle. They included a German Mesut Ãzil and a Japanese Shinji Kagawa.         Out of that impeccable stillness and silence came the roar of 77000 spectators and the organized rush of 22 players competing for an edge. Arsenal had suffered here the heaviest defeat  by 8-2 in 2011  of the era in which ArsÃ¨ne Wenger has been its manager.         But there was no expectation of that on this crisp and fine Manchester evening. In fact this has been the season so far when Arsenal has mastered its one weakness the vulnerability almost the disdain it used to have for defensive duties. Not once could Liverpool score against it last week and not once did Borussia Dortmund do so in Germany in midweek.         However Arsenal did fall to a set piece United routine midway through the first half at Old Trafford. And there was an obvious reason why.         Wayne Rooney won and took a corner kick out on the left. He directed the ball toward the near post of Arsenals goal guided it deliberately for his attacking partner and Arsenals former striker van Persie.         The closest two Gunners Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud defended like forwards. They were not really adept at the task. Ramsey stood still and allowed van Persie to jog past him; Giroud was beaten in the jump and van Persie sold by Arsenal to United for 23 million pounds in 2011 connected with a glancing header so fine and so powerful that it was over the line at the far post before the defender Kieran Gibbs could intercept it.         Such a cold goal. So clinical so precise and so calculated.         We knew at that point that Manchester United is beginning to get to grips after an indifferent start to the season caused no doubt by the uncertainty of losing its manager Alex Ferguson to retirement after more than a quarter of a century in charge. Set piece goals are part of the armory that Fergusons successor David Moyes had always employed at his previous cub Everton.         With set-piece soccer comes aerial combat. Two repercussions of that came before half time first when Manchesters Phil Jones and Arsenals goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny both went for a high ball into the goalmouth. They collided head-to-head Szczesny was treated while he lay on the turf and Jones somewhat harshly was yellow-carded by the referee.         That stricture seemed unnecessary because this at worst had been an unintended miscalculation between two men with eyes only for the ball. Quite possibly the ref Michael Oliver was being overly strict a week after the Tottenham Hotspur goalie Hugo Lloris risked playing on with concussion.         Lloris incidentally was prevented by the doctors from returning for the Spurs game on Sunday a game that was lost 1-0 at home to Newcastle United. Coming after Chelsea had dropped points against West Bromwich and Manchester City went down by the same score at Sunderland this turned into a very inviting weekend for both United and Arsenal.         United needed victory to get itself back into the title race. Arsenal hoped for the points to stretch the lead it had impressively built after 10 rounds in the Premier League.         Understandably therefore this contest in Manchester was hard fought with neither side willing to give an inch. United clearly has not lost the mettle that made it a champion.         One unforeseen handicap had befallen Arsenal even before the team arrived at the stadium. Four of its players fell ill somewhere between the return journey from Dortmund and the journey north to Old Trafford. Two of that quartet the giant defender Per Mertesacker and the elusive winger Tomas Rosicky did not even make the trip a third Mikel Arteta declared himself ready for action and the other affected player the German teenager Serge Gnarby was on the subs bench.         How much that disrupted Wengers game plan he would not say. Excuses are not in the vocabulary of a club hoping and intending to take the Premiership crown off the side it was visiting.         Defending champions however are no less likely to give up a lead to pretenders. The unforgiving physical aspect to the game continued unabated and by half time it was Manchester that was forced to re-arrange its defense when its captain and strong man Nemanja Vidic suffered a cut mouth.         Another facial injury. A suggestion perhaps of another slight concussion and though Vidic was back on his feet he was withdrawn and replaced. If English soccer has learned one thing from the controversy of the previous weekend it appears to be that sanity will prevail from here on in.         Last week Tottenhams coach AndrÃ© Villas-Boas had claimed it was his call his final word that counted in respect of allowing his confused keeper to return to the fray. As taut and as tense as the United-Arsenal conflict was the home sides captain was taken off for his own good when he suffered had injury.         Even as the home crowd sang their triumphant songs even as the relief encircled the arena many of us were quietly glad that common sense in medical matters had resurfaced in the English sport.

112,100000002544723,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,"Robbery Attempt Preceded Ice Rink Shooting, Police Say",J. DAVID GOODMAN;LIZ ROBBINS,978,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/nyregion/robbery-attempt-unfolded-before-shooting-at-bryant-park-rink-police-say.html,19,It was a crisp Saturday night the skaters jumping onto the freshly groomed ice in the oasis of Bryant Park in Midtown Frank Sinatra and Billie Holiday in the background. Nearby a wedding party was in full tilt at the Bryant Park Grill; vendors were cleaning up their stalls.         Then  the gunfire came . Several shots in quick succession.         Stunned revelers rushed frantically for the exits many stopping only to remove their skates leaving their shoes behind in their haste to escape. Among the few who remained were Javier Contreras 20 struck in the abdomen leg and hands; and Adonis Mera 14. Hours before Adonis had lugged his skates from Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan to the rink as he often did; his Facebook page included pictures of his Bauer hockey skates. Now he lay quivering on the ice with a bullet wound to his torso.         On Sunday detectives began reconstructing the events leading to the shooting which officials said was an aberration in the tree-canopied park behind the main branch of the New York Public Library. Since the  Bryant Park rink  opened in 2005 incidents were no worse than a fistfight said Daniel Biederman the president of the Bryant Park Corporation.         Theres never been a shooting said Frank DiPrisco the executive director of the event company Upsilon Ventures that runs the rink. Indeed while there have been shootings in or  near roller-skating rinks  in New York City no one could recall a recent shooting at an ice-skating rink.         By midday the police said that they had a 16-year-old suspect from the Bronx in custody at a Midtown station house and that witnesses had flagged him as the gunman.         The police identified him as Cory Dunton and said that he had been charged with attempted murder assault reckless endangerment and weapons possession.         The problem began shortly before 11 p.m. on Saturday when those hoping to still grab at least a few minutes of nighttime skating stood in a snaking line by a temporary tent on the parks south side.         The police said someone approached Mr. Contreras and demanded his winter jacket.         Mr. Contreras refused to hand over his coat believed to be a Marmot Mammoth commonly referred to as the Biggie and  occasionally the object of robberies  around the city. The two men did not know each other the police said. The stranger left.         But minutes later the police said the stranger returned with a handgun to the north side of the ice rink where he summoned Mr. Contreras who was skating and opened fire.         The police said possibly as many as seven shots were fired; Mr. Contreras was struck multiple times. The two wounded skaters were taken to Bellevue Hospital Center where they were listed as in stable condition on Sunday.         Danielle Behrens 21 was on the ice when she heard the shots. I processed it for about two seconds she said. But when she saw people dropping to the floor she got into a crouch before fleeing the ice. Her skates still on she hustled into a bathroom stall. I locked it she said. I was physically shaking and praying.         The rink has a capacity of about 500 skaters and park officials said about 300 were there when the shots were fired.         Everybody ran said Keshia Bowens 24. It was like a stampede.         Police officers ran onto the ice accompanied by paramedics. A young woman with long hair wailed clutching a metal police barricade just outside the rink. My brother just got shot in front of my face! she moaned as a friend tried to comfort her.         A friend of Adoniss said he rushed to the teenager after seeing him lying on the ice. He said he couldnt feel his legs and he was shaking nervously said the friend Christopher Guerrero 19 who grew up near Adonis near 160th Street.         He always goes skating every winter; it was like a hobby for him said Mr. Guerrero a freshman at Bronx Community College.         Inside the Bryant Park Grill wedding guests danced to throbbing music as parkgoers fled.         They told us that no one could leave but thankfully the party was still going on so no one wanted to leave said Neza Jimenez the D.J. at the reception. The maÃ®tre d just warned me not to open the door if I saw anyone trying to get in.         The rink at Bryant Park a popular destination for tourists and a familiar harbinger of the holiday season is the only place in New York City where skating is free for those with their own skates. It opened on Nov. 1.         By Sunday morning all traces of the shooting had been scrubbed from the ice and skaters returned as did the crooning of Sinatra over the speakers. Small children their parents in tow circled the ice laughing and falling gleefully.         Josef Melzer 19 a Yeshiva University student had been skating with his brother minutes before the shooting. As he went to catch a bus uptown he saw people running in socks and carrying their skates.         I was shocked out of my pants Mr. Melzer said after learning what had precipitated their flight.         Park officials were flabbergasted too.         Bryant Park is essentially crime-free Mr. Biederman said. When we took it over there were 500 felonies a year. And now theres been nothing violent for the last 20 years or so. The record is good enough that we dont have to caution everybody that its a dangerous area.         The crowd on Sunday mornings however is different from the crowd on weekend nights regular skaters and officials acknowledge.         Debbie Squiers said she no longer brought her 8-year-old daughter Jordan Mandel on Friday nights because she found the skating at Bryant Park to be too aggressive.         Its tough here at night. They get a lot of teenagers. You have to go to Wollman Ms. Squiers said.         Penn Bullock Kenan Christiansen and Fausto Pinto contributed reporting.        Also in Video »

Incognito acknowledged that the words may appear inappropriate to those unfamiliar with his relationship with Martin but that they were typical of what he said was a friendship.         Im embarrassed by my actions Incognito said. But what I want people to know is the way Jonathan and the rest of the offensive line and how our teammates how we communicate its vulgar.         He added When the words are put in the context I can understand why a lot of eyebrows get raised.         He said Martin also sent him threatening text messages.         The interviewer  Jay Glazer  of Fox Sports said that he had been friends with Incognito for about five years and trained him in  mixed martial arts  for three years.         Martin has not returned to the team while Incognito was suspended indefinitely. The N.F.L. has hired Ted Wells a well-known lawyer to investigate.         Investigators will interview Incognito in Florida this week Fox Sports said. The N.F.L. declined to comment about details of its investigation.         The league is likely to be interested in the content of the 1142 text messages that Incognito said he traded with Martin in the past year that he shared with Fox.         One message said to be sent by Martin after he left the team nearly two weeks ago suggested that he did not blame Incognito but was tired of the locker-room culture.         As the leader as his best friend on the team thats what has me miffed  how I missed this Incognito said. I never saw it. I never saw it coming.         Martins agent and lawyer did not respond to messages asking for comment.        
114,100000002544717,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,politics,Harbingers of the 2016 U.S. Election,ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEW,650,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/us/politics/harbingers-of-the-2016-us-election.html,,WASHINGTON  The takeaways from last weeks elections are about a man and a state.         The man  Chris Christie  was overwhelmingly re-elected governor of New Jersey bringing cheer to Republicans. The state is Virginia which is inching toward becoming a Democratic-leaning outpost. With both there are caveats.         Mr. Christie was a big winner; some consider him a clear favorite for the 2016 presidential nomination and even the de facto leader of his besieged and divided party.         The recently published headline-grabbing book on the 2012 election Double Down: Game Change 2012 by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann provides an insightful critique of the 51-year-old New Jersey Republican. He is smart tough empathetic confident and arrogant. Wall Street billionaires many of whom dont give a whit about cultural or social issues melt into a drooling man-crush around the take-no-prisoners Mr. Christie.         There also are yellow lights. Mitt Romneys camp leaked the information they gathered while vetting Mr. Christie as a possible running mate on the Republican presidential ticket in 2012. It allegedly contained questionable billing dubious relationships and dealings and temperamental concerns. If Christie had been in the nomination fight against us we would have destroyed him Mr. Romneys advisers concluded according to the authors.         Then theres the question of how the brash in-your-face Jersey style will play in the Midwest or the South. Conservative Republicans question Mr. Christies bona fides on immigration climate change and guns and they resent his failure to hate President Obama. Tax activist Grover Norquist predicts a softness on gun control will be especially troublesome for Christie.         As Mr. Christie tries to assuage conservatives who form the base of the party he risks losing his calling card: straight-talking authenticity.         Still even though the old-line Republican establishment may be in eclipse it has been a long time since they had a candidate as formidable this early.         Many Republicans say they lost the Virginia gubernatorial race because their candidate state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli was flawed. True but the Democratic victor  Terry McAuliffe  is from New York has been a wheeler-dealer in money and politics for decades and has failed to deliver on a promise he made that a company he controlled would create jobs in Virginia.         More instructive if somewhat muddled are the Election Day exit polls. The electorate was 72 percent white down from 78 percent four years earlier. Even if the black turnout was slightly exaggerated the demographics of Virginia are changing. Thats bad for Republicans.         Young voters represented 13 percent of the electorate this time up from 10 percent four years ago. Mr. McAuliffe won this group by five points much less than Mr. Obamas 25-point margin in the presidential contest. A third-party libertarian candidate did best with this demographic getting 15 percent; he espoused tolerance and keeping the government out of peoples personal lives  views many Republicans reject.         The exit polls also cast doubt on Republicans claims that they almost won the race because of the unpopularity of the Affordable Care Act. By a slight margin Obamacare was viewed negatively by voters this year a result that is virtually unchanged from 2012 exit polls in the state.         Geoff Garin a McAuliffe campaign poll-taker said the controversial measure actually helped his candidate.  Medicaid  expansion is part of Obamacare and Cuccinellis opposition to that was an important part of the appeal to voters we targeted he said.         All things being equal though they probably wont be color Virginia slightly blue going into 2016.         Theres no cause for cockiness. Democrats expected to do better with white working-class Virginians based on the idea that race may have played a role in Mr. Obamas miserable showing with that group. Yet white working-class men voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Cuccinelli; southwest Virginia a stronghold of these voters went as decisively Republican as last time.         We have a lot of work to start getting votes of working-class whites Mr. Garin said.        
115,100000002542186,0,Article,News,World,world,europe,English Proficiency Falters Among the French,CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE,701,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/world/europe/english-proficiency-falters-among-french.html,,MARSEILLE France  Marseilles new Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations opened in June part of the citys celebration of its status as this years European Capital of Culture.         Though the museum is European in ambition many of its exhibits are labeled only in French: English though firmly established as the global language of business education and culture is glaringly absent from most of the signage though an English-language audio tour is available.         A study released last week suggests that this absence is symbolic of a significant trend. The study by Education First an international education company found that while English proficiency among European adults is generally increasing proficiency in  France  is both low and declining.         According to the third EF English Proficiency Index released last week France ranked 35th among 60 nations where English is not the main language. The study put the countrys average English language skills in the low proficiency bracket between China and the United Arab Emirates  and last among European nations. It also found that France was one of only two European countries where proficiency had decreased over the past six years. Norway was the other; but there proficiency remained at such a high level that the change was insignificant.         The rankings are based on the results of 750000 online assessment tests completed last year  some online others by English language school applicants.         EFs English Proficiency Index based on the test results compared country scores with the results of a similar study carried out between 2007 and 2009 to identify trends in proficiency levels over the past six years.         There are some countries that are still not giving the basic message that English is a necessary skill said Kate Bell a researcher with EF in Paris.         According to Ms. Bell the level of English proficiency among French adults suffers both from inadequate teaching at high school level and the reality that  despite fears of French cultures being overwhelmed by American pop culture very little English is actually used in everyday life.         Unlike its smaller northern European neighbors France dubs most American films and television shows into French. The top English speakers in continental Europe  Norway Sweden and the Netherlands  all tend to use subtitling.         Its a vicious-virtuous cycle said Ms. Bell: Audiences not used to subtitling tend to shy away from it which in turn diminishes their capacity to understand English.         Frances secondary school system which has only recently started testing English oral skills as part of the Baccalaureate is a major reason for poor language skills she said.         Spain ranked at 23 in the index has risen in the listing since introducing public English-Spanish bilingual schools. According to EF data the country has significantly improved its proficiency level since 2007.         Eastern European countries are faring much better. Estonia is fourth in the survey which puts it in the very high proficiency bracket just after the traditional Scandinavian heavyweights. Poland Hungary and Slovenia  all in the high proficiency bracket  are ranked in the top 10 with Hungary showing significant improvement.         English is the de facto language of communication today between people who dont share a native language Ms. Bell. said Measuring English proficiency is in many ways a proxy measurement of international integration.         Turkey though still a low proficiency nation ranked 41st in the index was the country showing the biggest improvement in the past six years. EF researchers point to Turkey as a perfect example of economic development and international engagement that go hand-in-hand with English proficiency.         Because of its prominence in international business higher education and politics the importance of basic proficiency in English can scarcely be overstated. More than just a linguistic skill adult English proficiency is key to success in the globalized world.         Conversely the EF study suggests that weak proficiency in English may correlate with weak integration into the global economy.         The Middle East and North Africa are the weakest regions in English the study said with Iraq ranked 60th at the bottom of the list.         Poor English remains one of the key competitive weaknesses of Latin America it added with more than half the countries in the region in the lowest proficiency band.

GORDON;MARK LANDLER;JODI RUDOREN,1118,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/world/middleeast/kerry-no-deal-in-hand-defends-negotiating-strategy-on-iran.html,11,GENEVA  As Secretary of State John Kerry and foreign ministers from other world powers sought to work out an interim agreement to constrain Irans nuclear program the Iranian governments insistence on formal recognition of its right to enrich uranium emerged as a major obstacle diplomats said Sunday.         In long hours of closed-door discussions Western and Iranian negotiators haggled over the language of a possible agreement. Toward the end of a marathon session some diplomats believed that only a handful of words appeared to separate the two sides.         But the dispute over enrichment rights among other differences meant that the talks ended not with the breakthrough that many had hoped for but with only a promise that lower-level negotiators would meet here in 10 days for more discussions.         Many reports have ascribed the failure of the talks to Frances insistence that any agreement put tight restrictions on a heavy-water plant that Iran is building which can produce plutonium.         But while France took a harder line than its partners on some issues a senior American official said it was the Iranian delegation that balked at completing an interim agreement saying that it had to engage in additional consultations in Tehran before proceeding further.         A senior American official who briefed Israeli reporters and experts in Jerusalem on Sunday said that the six world powers in the talks had approved a working document and presented it to the Iranians according to Herb Keinon of The Jerusalem Post who attended the briefing.         It was too tough for them Mr. Keinon quoted the American official as saying of the Iranians. They have to go back home talk to their government and come back.         The failure to achieve a breakthrough in Geneva followed a week in which the Iranians had raised the expectations of a possible one perhaps calculating that this would add to the pressure on Western nations to make concessions.         Both Mr. Kerry and his Iranian counterpart sought to put the best face on the deflating outcome.         We are all on the same wavelength and that gives us the impetus to go forward when we meet again Mohammad Javad Zarif Irans foreign minister told reporters after the talks ended.         Mr. Kerry had a similar message: Theres no question in my mind that we are closer now as we leave Geneva than we were when we came and that with good work and good faith over the course of the next weeks we can in fact secure our goal.         Still the failure to conclude an accord gave an opening for critics in Congress who have vowed to push for tougher sanctions and in Israel and the conservative Arab Persian Gulf monarchies to mobilize opposition to an agreement.         Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee a senior Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee accused the Obama administration of dealing away our leverage in an appearance on the NBC program Meet the Press.         Speaking to a large gathering of American Jewish leaders on Sunday evening Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel warned that his country would not be the only target of an Iranian nuclear weapon. Coming to a theater near you  you want that? Mr. Netanyahu asked. Well do something about that!         Defending his negotiating strategy Mr. Kerry insisted Sunday that the agreement to freeze Irans nuclear program that he was seeking would be in Israels interest. We are not blind and I dont think we are stupid Mr. Kerry said on Meet the Press.         I think we have a pretty strong sense of how to measure whether or not we are acting in the interests of our country and of the globe he added and particularly of our allies like Israel and the gulf states and others in the region.         At the heart of the debate is the Obama administrations two-part strategy which calls for an interim agreement to temporarily freeze Irans nuclear efforts for six months so that diplomats have time to try to negotiate a more comprehensive accord.

117,100000002542178,0,Article,News,World,world,americas,Children Thrive in Rural Colombia's Flexible Schools,SARA HAMDAN,1001,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/world/americas/children-thrive-in-rural-colombias-flexible-schools.html,,Myriam Mazzo is a teacher in the central Colombian city of Armenia a rural town of about 300000 people nestled in the mountains southwest of BogotÃ¡. In her schools single classroom she teaches children of various ages and grade levels who work in small groups at their own pace. Rather than standing by a blackboard at the front of the class Ms. Mazzo moves among them serving as a guide more than an instructor.         Using this method she has taught generations of children the sons and daughters of local farmers and coffee growers to read write and do math. Her primary school students are often among the first in their families ever to have set foot in a classroom.         Ms. Mazzo has used this method of teaching known as Escuela Nueva or New School for 28 years after experience teaching in a traditional public school in  Colombia . The method developed by Clara Victoria (Vicky) Colbert de Arboleda in the 1970s was designed specifically for teachers like Ms. Mazzo teaching multiple grade levels in one classroom in rural communities.         Ms. Colbert comes from a prominent Colombian family with a tradition of educational activism. Her mother founded teacher training colleges and was a forward looking educator she said in an interview while her godfather was a former Colombian education minister.         Ms. Colbert taught courses on the sociology of education while studying sociology at the  Javeriana University in BogotÃ¡  and then worked giving distance courses to rural teachers before winning a Ford Foundation scholarship to graduate school at Stanford University where she studied for masters degrees in the sociology of education and comparative education.         At Stanford I was exposed to such wonderful theories and learning so when I came back I wanted to tackle basic education and work with the poorest of the poor schools the isolated schools she said.         Returning to Colombia she began to work with the Ministry of Education in the mid-1970s as a coordinator with rural schools across the country.         Often teachers in those schools have students who miss school for months at a time to work or for family reasons.         With Escuela Nueva the student is a leader no longer the shy kid in a traditional classroom Ms. Mazzo said in a telephone interview. Hes not the one afraid to speak or share ideas he is participative democratic knows how to share and work in teams and  most importantly  he can work at his own pace so he is motivated to come back after long absences.         Inadequate resources and low academic achievement usually lead to high dropout and repetition rates in traditional schools. In the QuindÃ­o region of Colombia around Armenia for example students must overcome not only poverty and a lack of educational resources but also a culture that encourages children to work to contribute to a familys income  and the lure of easy money to be made from dealing drugs.         Escuela Nuevas flexible program encourages dropout students to come back to school to study at their own pace and to take exams when they are ready.         If a student learns faster I can guide him and he can go even faster; and if a student has difficulties or has been away for a long while he can be supported said Ms. Mazzo. If a student is away due to illness or farmer parents who move around when he comes back to school he can follow his learning guides where he left off  so students are motivated self-esteem stays high and they never repeat grades.         The Escuela Nuevas strategy also aims to make education more relevant to the students daily lives and those of their families  mapping the area where they live for example and learning about the agricultural calendar and the learning and teaching materials direct students to share what they learn in school with their families and communities.         Decades after the model was first developed in 1975 Escuela Nueva has received support  including financial  from the Colombian government Unesco and The World Bank and was implemented into a national educational policy in Colombia in the late 1980s. By 1988 Unesco declared that Colombia was the only country in Latin America and the Caribbean where rural schools outperformed urban schools because of the Escuela Nueva method.         Between 2007 and 2009 the program taught 700000 children in Colombia and the model is now implemented in 20000 schools across the country in both rural and poor urban areas. Escuela Nueva has now expanded internationally to 19 countries including Brazil the Philippines and India benefiting more than five million underprivileged children.         Ms. Colbert and the model have won a string of awards over the years most recently the $500000 WISE Prize for Education awarded by the World Innovation Summit for Education in Doha Qatar in October . The prize is an annual award funded by the  Qatar Foundation for Science Education and Community Development  that recognizes innovative contributions to international education.         When you see these isolated invisible schools why wait for big educational top-down reform from the government? said Ms. Colbert while in Doha to receive the prize. We started the fire from the bottom up by making small changes in classrooms and working with rural teachers to improve morale results and resources.         The method transforms the conventional learning paradigm where the teacher is the only one talking and conveying information in a classroom. The idea is that students are placed in the center of the learning process. While the philosophy is not new its application in a low-cost way in rural communities by Ms. Colberts team is revolutionary.         Can you imagine a child who leaves and is forced to repeat a grade level every time he comes back? she said. Wheres the self-esteem? So we designed learning materials that promote self-paced learning and a flexible schedule because what we had before in our schools simply wasnt working.         Change wont take place up in some office it has to take place right on the ground.        
118,100000002544577,0,Article,News,Arts,arts,design,Pressure Mounts to Return Nazi-Looted Art,ALISON SMALE;MELISSA EDDY,813,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/arts/design/pressure-mounts-to-clear-up-ownership-of-nazi-looted-art.html,3,BERLIN  The mysterious discovery of 1400 artworks apparently collected by a German dealer under the Nazis continued  to ripple disturbingly  through Germany and the art world on Sunday prompting reports of a deal with Hitlers propaganda chief and calls for Germans to do more to return lost works to Jewish heirs.         The Bild newspaper reported on Sunday that the dealer  an art connoisseur named Hildebrand Gurlitt who supported artists banned by the Nazis but also dealt in stolen art with Hitlers propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels  arranged with Goebbels in 1940 to pay 4000 Swiss francs for 200 pieces of degenerate art the Nazi term to describe many modernist European works.         In southwestern Germany meanwhile the police said they had recovered 22 valuable artworks after a call from someone who gave an address just outside Stuttgart to go there and retrieve them.         Deidre Berger head of the American Jewish Committee in Germany called on the German government to move decisively to clear up ownership questions surrounding the art.         It is a disgrace that laws are still in existence that justify injustice Ms. Berger said in a statement referring to Nazi-era laws that leave the ownership status of some confiscated art unclear. She also noted the poignancy of having the art come to light as Jews gathered in Berlin this weekend to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Kristallnacht the beginning of Hitlers murderous persecution of the Jews.         Paris Match published what it said was a photograph of Hildebrand Gurlitts son Cornelius who reportedly kept the 1400 works stashed for decades in a Munich apartment belonging to his family. A neighbor of Mr. Gurlitts in Salzburg Austria confirmed that the picture was that of the elderly man.         Der Spiegel magazine also reported receiving a typewritten and signed letter last week from Cornelius Gurlitt that listed the return address as the same apartment where the art was found. In the letter the writer praised your spiritually rich and nobly minded magazine but asked that the Gurlitt family name no longer be mentioned in it.         The large trove of art was discovered by authorities in February 2012 but became public knowledge only in recent days stunning the art world and setting off a scramble to establish ownership. Authorities have publicly identified just a handful of the works.         In its report on the Gurlitt-Goebbels contract Bild included a list of the 200 works that were to change hands including ones by among others Picasso Chagall and Gauguin.         After World War II Hildebrand Gurlitt reported that most of his collection and all of his inventory had been destroyed in the 1945 bombing of Dresden. Twenty to 25 works listed as belonging to him were included in an exhibition that toured the United States in the mid-1950s. He died in a traffic accident in 1956.         The police in the southwestern state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg said on Sunday that they had received a call from a resident of Kornwestheim about six miles north of Stuttgart which sent officers to a house there on Saturday where they recovered 22 artworks.         The police did not identify the caller but Bild named the man as Nikolaus FrÃ¤ssle the brother-in-law of Cornelius Gurlitt. The police said that the caller had said that news reports led him to fear for the safety of the works. The police took the works to a safe place the statement said. Bild said Mr. FrÃ¤ssle was married to Cornelius Gurlitts sister identified in official archives as Nicoline Benita Renate Gurlitt who was born in Hamburg in 1935 three years after Cornelius. Bild said she had died but provided no further details.         The contract with Goebbels listed Hildebrand Gurlitt as living in Hamburg at the time. At some point during World War II the family moved to or near Dresden and fled farther south to Bavaria as the war was ending.         The elder Gurlitt was interrogated by the Allies and his collection  listed as a few hundred works  was kept until 1950 when it was returned to him. The origins of those pieces  and of the far larger cache found in the Munich apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt  is unclear. German authorities have said that research is needed before they can publish a list but museums and the heirs of collectors who were stripped of their works by the Nazis have urged swift action to return artworks to their rightful owners.         The Sunday edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper meanwhile reported that a painting by Max Liebermann one of the few of the 1400 works to be publicly identified was listed in Germanys official databank for art seized by the Nazis. The piece depicting two men riding horses on a beach is sought by the descendants of David Friedmann who had been a sugar refiner in Breslau a former German city now known as Wroclaw in Poland.

119,100000002544654,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,,"Shots Fired Into Crowd at Party in Houston Suburb, Killing Two",MANNY FERNANDEZ,519,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/us/houston-texas-shooting-house-party.html,14,CYPRESS Tex.  A house party packed with teenagers and young adults in this Houston suburb turned deadly on Saturday evening when gunfire erupted the authorities said killing two high school students and injuring at least 20 other partygoers who were either shot or hurt as they hopped over fences or jumped out of second-story windows in a frantic rush to escape.         More than 100 people were inside the house shortly before 11 p.m. celebrating a young womans 18th birthday at a party that had been promoted on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook officials said. Many of the partygoers were students at or recent graduates of nearby Cypress Springs High School.         Sheriff Adrian Garcia of Harris County said the chaos apparently began when a young man fired a gun inside the house in celebration. Another young man standing nearby pulled out a gun and fired into the crowd in response the sheriff said.         I can only assume that it is just a horrible combination of immaturity access to a firearm and the inability to control ones self Sheriff Garcia said on Sunday.         The two victims who died a 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man were students at local high schools. About 16 other young people had gunshot wounds and four others were treated for various injuries including a broken leg and twisted ankles. The sheriff described the party as a birthday party gone wild and criticized its organizers for promoting it widely on social media and creating dangerous conditions inside. An adult bouncer had been standing at the door and patting down the guests in an apparent attempt to check for weapons.         Any time that you have to factor in the possibility of a bouncer and being searched at the door youve already taken a turn for the worse Sheriff Garcia said. Youre saying to the social media world I dont know who you are but youre invited. Thats not a good practice.         The authorities said they were searching for two young men  ages 17 and 22  who are suspects in the shooting.         Mariah Boulden 18 a student at Cypress Springs who threw the party at her family home said she put the adult bouncer at the door because she wanted everyone to be safe. She said the young men suspected in the shooting had not been invited and were not searched because they entered the house through a back door. She said that she and her friends were about to shut the party down because it had become too crowded and the mood had shifted  then the gunfire broke out.         Ms. Boulden whose mother was at the party and a few of her friends and relatives who were also there said the celebration up to the point of the gunfire had been fine and people were dancing to a music provided by a D.J.         Signs of the chaos were still visible on Sunday. Blood drops stained the street and the driveways of nearby houses. The garage door of the party house was knocked loose from its tracks. Balloons drifted by the front door.        
120,100000002544530,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,soccer,"Hanging on, Barely, in the Premier League",ROB HUGHES,958,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/sports/soccer/hanging-on-barely-in-the-premier-league.html,,LONDON  Im sad Im angry but Im also very proud of my team. We go away from home we fight the big boys try to play with no fear and show a little bit of personality  and its galling when you dont get what you deserve.         That was how Steve Clarke the West Bromwich Albion team manager described the experience of his sides leading at  Chelsea  until the fourth minute of added time when the referee awarded a dubious penalty from which Chelsea escaped with a 2-2 draw.         Clarke knows full well the intimidation that big boys like Chelsea derive from home advantage. He played in Chelsea blue as a defender for 11 years.         He spent four years as a coach helping JosÃ© Mourinho to establish one of the great unbeaten home runs in English soccer.         Now a visitor Clarke was suggesting  and many would agree with him  that referees can be swayed by the baying of a raucous home crowd and by Chelseas Brazilian midfielder Ramires falling theatrically in the penalty box.         The end result felt like a reprieve to Mourinho who has not been beaten in 66 home matches as Chelseas manager.         It felt like a betrayal to West Brom which has not won in Chelseas stadium in over 30 years.         But that is the nature of the beast. There are huge clubs playing for the prizes and there are lesser clubs whose aim from one season to the next starts with survival.         This season is barely a quarter of the way through. The coaches of two failing teams Crystal Palace and Sunderland have already departed. A third from Fulham is on the brink. And a fourth Norwich City coach Chris Hughton is living day to day with calls for his removal.         What do you do in Hughtons situation? Your board has spent 23 million pounds  by the standards of a small club like Norwich an unprecedented fortune  trying to purchase players who will give you a stronger foothold in the Premiership.         But again the big boys are not giving your new team time to gel.         As October turned to November Norwich was crushed 4-0 by Manchester United in the league cup and then hammered 7-0 in the league at Manchester City.         The rumors spread that the team was not working that the new players either lacked the heart for the fight or simply were not putting in the effort for the team manager.         Chris Hughton let me tell you is a decent and knowledgeable man. He played for years at Tottenham Hotspur and he served a tough apprenticeship coaching at Newcastle United and Birmingham City. He knows how the sport works and how the axis of success at clubs with constrained budgets depends totally on trust between the clubs board its coach and the team.         So Hughton must have feared the worst when at halftime at Norwichs Carrow Road stadium on Saturday the crowd bayed for his blood. The team was again down by a goal from West Ham Uniteds Ravel Morrison.         The manager has 15 minutes alone with his team in the changing room. Fifteen minutes to get his pitch right. He tells the players that they are more talented than their results and their performances suggest. He says he has faith in them. He asks for calm self-belief but at the same time he urges the players to step up their pace.         Its about a reaction Hughton was to say after the final whistle. And we got a reaction in the second half.         Didnt they just. From that goal down Norwich scored three times to turn the booing into wild celebration. The fans might be fickle or they might simply be desperate for their team to turn a corner.         And in those circumstances every little helps. Jussi Jaaskelainen West Hams towering and usually dependable Finnish goalkeeper made a rare error. He fumbled a high cross dropped the ball and brought down Gary Hooper in his attempt to grab it back.         Hooper is one of the new players bought in his case for Â£5 million or $8 million from Glasgow Celtic to score some goals for Norwich. Up to Saturday he had failed. But he was man enough to take and score the penalty shot.         Relief poured through the team. Robert Snodgrass then made it 2-1 for Norwich with a free kick curled over the wall and inside the post with a technique that would have made David Beckham proud.         Finally Leroy Fer a Dutch player whom Hughton has put enormous faith in strode through the midfield leaving West Ham defenders trailing in his wake. And when Fer swept in a low shot beyond Jaaskelainens considerable reach the relief was palpable         Why even Delia Smith the British celebrity chef who is part owner of Norwich waved her yellow and green scarf. Mrs Smith had lately refused to comment whenever reporters or TV interviewers asked her the inevitable questions about Norwich City its new team and its manager.         Maybe Fer is the player who personifies the struggle. The Dutch think a lot of him  and there is a lot of him. He stands 1.88 meters or 6-foot-2 and has a long stride reminiscent of the former Arsenal giant Patrick Vieira.         Fer grew up in Zoetermeer in the south of the Netherlands. His parents came from CuraÃ§ao in the Dutch Antilles and he dreamed of representing their island at a World Cup.         That remote dream ended when he was chosen to represent the Netherlands.         He might well go to the World Cup as a member of the Oranje. But his task right now is to help the Norwich Canaries stay in the  Premier League . And keep his manager employed.                Also in Video »       
121,100000002544497,0,Article,News,World,world,asia,Vast Challenges for Philippines After Typhoon,KEITH BRADSHER,1641,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/world/asia/philippines-typhoon.html,1,CEBU Philippines  Three days after one of the most powerful storms ever to buffet the Philippines the scale of the devastation and the desperation of the survivors were slowly coming into view.         The living told stories of the dead or dying  the people swept away in a torrent of seawater the corpses strewn among the wreckage. Photos from the hard-hit city of Tacloban showed vast stretches of land swept clean of homes and reports emerged of people who were desperate for food and water raiding aid convoys and stripping the stores that were left standing.         As Monday dawned it became increasingly clear that Typhoon Haiyan had ravaged cities towns and fishing villages when it played a deadly form of hopscotch across the islands of the central Philippines on Friday. By some estimates at least 10000 people may have died in Tacloban alone and with phone service out across stretches of the far-flung archipelago it was difficult to know if the storm was as deadly in more remote areas.         Barreling across palm-fringed beaches and plowing into frail homes with a force that by some estimates approached that of a tornado Haiyan delivered a crippling blow to this countrys midsection. The culprit increasingly appeared to be a storm surge that was driven by those winds which were believed to be among the strongest ever recorded in the Philippines lifting a wall of water onto the land as they struck. By some accounts the winds reached 190 miles an hour.         As aid crews struggled to reach ravaged areas the storm appeared to lay bare some of the perennial woes of the Philippines. The countrys roads and airports long starved of money by corrupt and incompetent governments are some of the worst in Southeast Asia and often make traveling long distances a trial. On Monday clogged with debris from splintered buildings and shattered trees the roads in the storms path were worse slowing rescue teams.         Richard Gordon the chairman of the Philippines Red Cross said that a Red Cross aid convoy to Tacloban had to turn back on Sunday after it stopped at a collapsed bridge and was nearly hijacked by a crowd of hungry people. There is very little food going in and what food there was was captured by the crowd Mr. Gordon said in a telephone interview on Monday morning.         The storm posed new challenges for President Benigno S. Aquino III who just two months ago struggled to wrest back a major city in the south from insurgents. Mr. Aquino has won plaudits at home and abroad for his fight against corruption during his three and a half years in office leading to increased foreign investment and an impressive growth rate. But he must still contend with Muslim separatists in the south and with provinces that have long been the domains of regional strongmen resistant to government control.         Now add to that list a storm that looks to be one of the countrys worst disasters at a time when emergency funds have been depleted by a series of other calamities most notably an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 that struck the middle of the country four weeks ago. On Monday after the reports of widespread raiding of stores and robberies and rising fears of a breakdown of law and order the government said it was flying more police officers to the region.         Although deadly storms are not unusual in the Philippines Typhoon Haiyan appears to stand apart both in the ferocity of its winds which some described as sounding like a freight train and in its type of destruction. Most deaths from typhoons in the Philippines are caused by mudslides and rivers flooding from heavy rains.         So when Haiyan sped across the islands on Friday some officials and weather experts in the Philippines thought they had witnessed something of a miracle. The storm that lit up social media for days with dire warnings was thought to have mostly spared the islands because it did not linger long enough to dump a deluge of rain.

I love the flavor of the oat flour but it is so fine that when I tried using all oat flour the pastry crumbled much too easily. So I combined it with corn flour which is finely ground cornmeal; Bobs Red Mill produces the version I used. Millet flour will also work but it has a chalkier flavor. The almond flour absorbs moisture and helps hold the dough together. The dough will crack if you roll it out cold so I roll it between pieces of plastic before I chill it. Then I remove it from the refrigerator and let it soften just enough so that I can line the tart pans without it cracking.         160 grams (approximately 1 1/4 cups) corn flour or finely ground cornmeal         150 grams (approximately 1 1/3 cups) oat flour (make sure it is from a gluten-free facility)         168 grams (6 ounces) butter preferably French style PlugrÃ          4 grams (1/2 teaspoon) fine sea salt         50 grams (approximately 1/4 rounded cup) sugar         40 grams (approximately 1/3 rounded cup) almond flour         9 grams (approximately 2 teaspoons) vanilla extract         63 grams egg (approximately 1 extra large plus 2 teaspoons) beaten          1.  Sift together the corn flour and the oat flour. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a bowl with a rubber spatula cream the butter and salt on medium speed for about 1 minute taking care not to whip. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the paddle with a rubber spatula and add the sugar. Combine with the butter at low speed. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the paddle.          2.  Add the almond flour and vanilla extract and combine at low speed.          3.  Gradually add the egg and one fourth of the flour mixture. Beat at low speed until just incorporated. Stop the machine and scrape down the bowl and the paddle.          4.  Gradually add the remaining flour and mix just until the dough comes together.          5.  Scrape the dough out of the bowl weigh it and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Place each piece between sheets of plastic wrap and gently roll out to a 10-1/2 inch circle. Place on a sheet pan and refrigerate for 1 hour or (preferably) longer.          6.  Very lightly butter a 9-inch tart pan or pie dish (depending on the recipe youll be using this for). You should not be able to see the butter. Remove one sheet of dough from the refrigerator and if it is very stiff set it out for about 5 minutes until its pliable. Ease the dough into 9-inch tart pan or pie dish. If the dough cracks just pinch the cracked edges together. You do not have to worry with gluten-free dough about over working and stiffening the pastry but try not to press the dough thinner in some places than in others.          To prebake:  I dont use pie weights because the grain flours tend to stick to the lining. The crust shouldnt buckle. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. With a fork pierce the bottom of the crust in rows. Place the tart pan on a baking sheet and place in the oven on the middle rack. Bake 25 to 30 minutes until lightly browned and dry. Remove from the heat and allow to cool completely before filling.          Variation:  Substitute millet flour for the corn flour.

Prem Watsa the Canadian immigrant success story and chairman of Fairfax Financial Holdings was huddled in the offices of his Toronto law firm Torys trying to salvage the biggest bet of his career. In late September Fairfax had made a highly conditional offer to buy  BlackBerry  the struggling smartphone maker based in nearby Waterloo Ontario. Few on Wall Street took the offer seriously instead viewing it as a way for Fairfax BlackBerry’s largest shareholder to bring other buyers into the picture.  But as Fairfax’s takeover deadline loomed no other buyers had surfaced and Fairfax had failed to find co-investors for its bid. Mr. Watsa and his team needed an alternative. Finally a solution of sorts emerged last Monday from the exhausted team backed by Mr. Watsa. Rather than buying out BlackBerry’s shareholders at $9 a share Fairfax and BlackBerry announced a new deal that would raise $1 billion in cash through convertible debt sold to a combination of Canadian American and Qatari investors. Thorsten Heins BlackBerry’s short-lived chief executive was succeeded by a new executive chairman and interim chief: John S. Chen another successful immigrant to North America who had turned around Sybase years earlier through a prescient move into mobile computing. Many viewed it as just another stalling tactic in a situation where few good outcomes are likely. BlackBerry’s battered shares dropped even lower. Yet Mr. Watsa’s determination to be personally involved in a messy corporate implosion speaks to his own pride his affection for Canada and his reluctance to walk away from what could be one of the worst moves he ever made. Arguably Canada’s leading contrarian investor Mr. Watsa enjoys a disproportionately large reputation as a canny player within the country’s relatively small financial community. But unlike say Conrad M. Black he is far from a public figure. Both Mr. Watsa and his executives gave no interviews to media outlets for years and now do so only sporadically. And Fairfax which was founded in its current form in 1985 only began quarterly conference calls with analysts in 2003. No one from the company would be interviewed for this story. Even in a country with a large population of immigrants from South Asia many of whom went on to great success Mr. Watsa 63 stands out. He was born near Hyderabad India and studied chemical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology before joining his brother in London Ontario after his graduation in 1971. He sold air conditioners and furnaces door to door to pay for M.B.A. studies there at the University of Western Ontario. In Mr. Watsa’s legend a key moment is when one of his managers at Confederation Life a now defunct insurer gave him a copy of “The Intelligent Investor” by Benjamin Graham. The book’s advocacy of value investing resonated with Mr. Watsa who also came to admire  Warren E. Buffett  chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway  for similar reasons. Fairfax owns a variety of insurance companies whose premiums provide it with a steady stream of capital for investment in a structure similar to Berkshire’s. Like Mr. Buffett Mr. Watsa appears to take pride in his annual letter to shareholders although his writing style leans toward the liberal use of exclamation points. Some argue that the comparisons end there. “Psychologically speaking he thinks he’s the Warren Buffett of the North” said one person who has followed his business closely over the years. But that person who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still occasionally does business with Mr. Watsa and did not want to offend him noted that Mr. Watsa favored investing in distressed firms with comparatively few shareholders with BlackBerry being a notable exception. “Typically he does these things in not such public high-profile companies. The rules of the game that he applied over his career don’t work in a liquid stock like this” the critic said. A person who worked with Mr. Watsa in the past said however that BlackBerry is precisely the sort of challenge Mr. Watsa seeks and relishes. “When it’s down and you can’t find a single person to help it that’s where he wants to be” said this person who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to complicate relations with Mr. Watsa whom he still knows socially. But he acknowledged that Fairfax was blindsided by the amount of publicity generated by the failed buyout offer. A decision in 2002 to add a listing on the  New York Stock Exchange  as well as Toronto forced Fairfax and Mr. Watsa out of their shells. It came in the middle of a seven-year period when problems with some insurance acquisitions in the United States hampered Fairfax’s financial performance. Hedge funds in the United States shorted Fairfax’s stock driving its share price down while attacking the strategies and methods of Mr. Watsa and his company. In 2006 Fairfax sued a group of hedge funds including SAC Capital Advisors and Third Point contending that they had tried for years to destroy the reputation of Mr. Watsa and Fairfax and then profit by betting that Fairfax’s stock would fall. Though many of the funds were dismissed from the case Mr. Watsa continued to pursue them for years spending tens of millions of dollars on legal fees. “We didn’t really understand the extent to which the short side of the equation would dominate the story” the person who once worked with Mr. Watsa said. The funds he said “just about destroyed the company.” People close to the hedge funds said they had legitimate reason to believe that Fairfax had in fact incurred huge losses but was masking them. Whether or not that was the case Mr. Watsa then made back those losses and brought Fairfax to new heights by successfully betting against the American housing market well before the financial crisis. Fairfax voluntarily delisted from the New York exchange in 2009. Mr. Watsa again uncomfortably finds himself under the microscope as he grapples with perhaps his greatest challenge ever in BlackBerry. In 2009 Mr. Watsa was recruited as the chancellor of the University of Waterloo by BlackBerry’s co-founder and former co-chairman Mike Lazaridis and the two became friends. When BlackBerry’s plummeting market share and stock price led Mr. Lazaridis to step down as co-chief in January 2012 Mr. Watsa revealed that he owned 5.1 percent of the company and joined its board. He soon doubled that holding and became a public champion of the company. In his last shareholders’ letter Mr. Watsa said that Fairfax which owns about 10 percent of the company had paid an average price of $17 a share. On Friday the stock closed at $6.56 share on Nasdaq. It is down nearly 45 percent this year. The person who once worked with Mr. Watsa said he most likely miscalculated how public scrutiny would impair his turnaround efforts with BlackBerry a company that has been a symbol of national pride in Canada. “He didn’t understand the extent the brand recognition mattered here” this person said. Fairfax consulted former mobile executives from Motorola and  Ericsson  about a successor for Mr. Heins. Mr. Chen who was born in Hong Kong was among the top three names on their list. Mr. Chen will commute from California to Canada and will not be the permanent chief executive. Fairfax nonetheless is apparently counting heavily on him to find a way out for BlackBerry. Mr. Chen is somewhat similar to Mr. Watsa his former associate said. “He came across instantly as a guy who was up for the challenge” the person said. “He’s a guy who wants to be there for a long time. He didn’t flip Sybase.” Aside from the lack of an obvious strategy for BlackBerry turning the company around while it remains publicly traded will be an enormous challenge said Douglas Cumming a professor of finance at York University in Toronto. “If they think they can get this all sorted out in the public eye that’s going to be a pretty rare event” Professor Cumming said adding that the glare on BlackBerry’s problems will further erode confidence in the brand. A person who has squabbled with Mr. Watsa over the years is skeptical that Fairfax will be able to save BlackBerry. “There have been a lot of smarter people looking at this and they can’t seem to make it work” he said. “Warren Buffett isn’t buying broken-down tech companies.” Fortis the biggest gas and electricity distribution utility in Canada agreed to buy UNS Energy Corporation at a 31 percent premium over the stock's closing price on Wednesday.

Mr. Fotheringham known as Wheelz performs his act shortly before a dirt bike rider performs a similarly acrobatic feat as explosions rock the racetrack all while thousands of raucous fans cheer from the stands. Though Nitro Circus is more of a carnival sideshow than an athletic showcase like the Olympics the brand has won the hearts and dollars of the coveted young male demographic. And while fans of this brash entertainment franchise tend to be younger the business itself is finally growing up. On Monday Nitro Circus will announce that the two businesses that worked together to produce the brand’s live shows television programs and films will become one company. The merger of the touring operation and the performance business previously separate entities is being helped by an investment of about $25 million from the Raine Group a New York merchant bank with deep roots in the entertainment industry. With a unified team and a new infusion of capital Nitro Circus hopes to extend its reach around the globe. It is planning a permanent live show in a still unknown site in Las Vegas and another permanent live show in Macau this one in an unused  Cirque du Soleil  theater at the Venetian Macau hotel. The spectacles featuring motorcyclists skateboarders scooter riders and other wheeled daredevils performing death-defying feats play well with resort city crowds with idle time and cash to spare. The group will also set up a training academy where it will field new talent for its shows and teach a new generation of enthusiasts how to emulate their favorite action sports stars. “We had to find a way to bring the two companies together and supercharge the business” Michael Porra the chief executive of Nitro Circus said in an interview. Raine will become a large minority shareholder in the combined company but the total valuation of the business could not be determined. “This industry had been on our radar but this is unique” Brent Richard a vice president at the Raine Group said in an interview. “It crosses a lot of themes in participatory sports. You have active participants and it crosses language and geographic borders quite easily.” Raine was also attracted to the fact that the average age of Nitro Circus fans who are mostly men is just 23. This demographic is increasingly difficult for advertisers to reach and Raine has already invested in Vice a youth media outlet. Travis Pastrana an extreme athlete and his friends Jeremy Rawle and Gregg Godfrey created the Nitro Circus brand. Operating under the Godfrey Entertainment name the three started by making a DVD of their exploits in 2003 and they built the brand over the next decade. Mr. Porra is from Australia and founded Nitro Circus Live to help the group tour internationally. But the two businesses had remained separate until now a source of complications as the group worked to grow. “We are super pumped to be partnering with the Raine Group to take the brand to the next level” Mr. Pastrana said in a statement. Though Nitro Circus athletes risk life and limb at each show there has never been a serious accident during a performance. But the face of the empire Mr. Pastrana has suffered his share of injuries over the years. Speaking to the talk show host  Jay Leno  recently he acknowledged that participating in extreme sports of the kind featured in Nitro Circus had left him with a dislocated spine torn left knee ligaments and a broken fibula.

133,tmRCXIMkkA7UzWUWmIZtOw,0,Blogs,Blog Post,Business Day,Business Day,Dealbook,Powering Employees With More Than a Paycheck ,TONY SCHWARTZ,1002,http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/powering-employees-with-more-than-a-paycheck/,,More than two-thirds of employees around the world a recent  Gallup poll found  feel disengaged dispirited and fatigued at work. Why is that? A value proposition is no more than the promise of a fair deal: I provide you with something you want and in exchange you give me something I consider worth the trade. That trade between employers and employees since the dawn of capitalism has been time for money. The problem is that buying people’s time is no guarantee you’ll get their best efforts. No amount of money will ever be sufficient to meet all employees’ needs at work. Rather than trying to demand more and more from employees employers need to invest more generously in meeting their people’s core needs: physical emotional mental and spiritual. When employees feel better taken care of they’re freed fueled and inspired to take better care of their customers and clients. It’s a win for everyone. Care at the physical level translates into giving employees the opportunity to take better care of themselves. Human beings aren’t designed to run the way computers do: at high speeds continuously for long periods of time. But they’re increasingly expected to do just that and it’s counterproductive. The more people try to keep pace with their digital lives the more fatigued they become the lower the quality of their work and the less value they create over time. Consider medical interns.  One study in The New England Journal of Medicine found  that interns who worked 24-hour shifts made 36 percent more medical errors than those working 16-hour shifts and five times the number of diagnostic errors and were 61 percent more likely to accidentally cut themselves during procedures. The study found that the rates of serious medical errors in two intensive care units “were lowered by eliminating extended work shifts and reducing the number of hours interns worked each week.” By asking interns to work less the hospitals improved their performance. Caring for employees at the physical level begins with creating a culture that values renewal and rest as a fuel for sustainable high performance. Google has done this since its founding by providing napping pods low-cost massages fitness areas and high-quality nutritious food at no cost to employees. Encouraging renewal serves employers and employees at the mental level too. Overloading the brain with information leads to distraction reducing how much it retains over time. Mental downtime not only provides an opportunity to relax and refuel but also to reflect and to digest new information. People also tend to get their best ideas during downtime when they’re not working toward a specific goal. But the most powerful aspect of caring for employees occurs at the emotional level. How people feel profoundly influences how they perform. Nothing so influences employees’ engagement as the feeling that they’re genuinely cared for and valued by their leaders and managers. When employees believe they are cared for they experience a variety of feelings including safety trust and well-being. If they don’t feel cared for they’re more likely to feel a sense of fear and threat. That can impair the ability to think clearly or creatively. As Daniel Goleman author of “Emotional Intelligence” put it “Threats to our standing in the eyes of others are remarkably potent biologically almost as powerful as those to our very survival.” Doug Conant the former chief executive of the Campbell Soup Company felt so strongly about the value of acknowledging people that in his 11 years at the company he  handwrote 30000 notes  to employees acknowledging their contributions. Engagement levels rose. At my company the Energy Project we’ve made it a practice to publicly acknowledge each other’s successes. We also hold a weekly community meeting that begins with a simple but powerful question: “How are you (really) feeling today?” The freedom to answer this question honestly helps us know what others are bringing to work emotionally and to be more attuned to them. Another core need is for meaning and significance. When a company stands for something beyond maximizing profit employees have the potential for a purpose beyond a paycheck. It’s both energizing and inspiring to work for a company that is committed to something beyond its immediate self-interest. That’s relatively easy for nonprofits whose goal is to add value to others. But it’s also possible for companies that sell more mundane products. Take  Toms Shoes . By committing to donate a pair of shoes to someone needy for every pair sold the company’s founder Blake Mycoskie has created a sense of mission among employees. Stephen Friedman president of MTV recently collaborated with a start-up called Catchafire that matches companies with specific skills to nonprofit organizations that need help. Employees at MTV got an opportunity to  use their skills  in website design branding and social media on behalf of the Center for Employee Opportunities an organization that helps inmates just released from prison get jobs. For all these examples what’s the hard evidence that taking better care of employees generates more value for their employers? The  2012 Towers Watson Global Workforce Study  surveyed 32000 employees across 30 countries. The main factor in driving employee engagement and higher performance it concluded is “a work environment that fully energizes employees by promoting their physical emotional and social well-being.” In companies with the most engaged employees 74 percent of them felt their leaders had a sincere interest in their well-being while just 16 percent of employees felt that way in the companies with the least engaged workers. There were stunning performance differences between the companies with the most engaged and least engaged employees. The companies with the least engaged employees had an average operating margin of 10 percent. The companies with the most engaged employees had an average operating margin of 27 percent — nearly three times as high. The Towers Watson research is compelling but the conclusion is entirely intuitive: Invest in and care for the physical emotional mental and spiritual well-being of employees and they’ll perform far better for longer.

134,S95vWiVgh7S87hx5Uom6zQ,0,Blogs,Blog Post,Business Day,Business Day,Dealbook,Rules Force Banks to Innovate for Survival,PETER EAVIS,1300,http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/rules-force-banks-to-innovate-for-survival/,,Bankers complain that the government’s overhaul of the banking system has saddled the industry with a heap of new rules stricter regulators and higher costs of doing business. But there is something they might not be so quick to mention in their complaints: The overhaul may also be pushing banks to innovate in important ways. The overhaul is reducing government subsidies for banks. The banks have for decades raised returns for shareholders with high levels of borrowing. The overhaul restricts that borrowing so banks will now have to work much harder to post the sort of returns their shareholders expect. Banks may decide to toss out old practices and adopt new ways of serving clients. Wall Street firms are devising new ways of making securities available to customers. Retail bank executives are rethinking how they can reduce branches while still serving customers. They also cannot ignore the start-up firms that are using technology to make loans far more quickly than banks do. “Banks have a huge cost infrastructure” said Samir Desai the chief executive and a co-founder of Funding Circle a British company that uses technology to connect small businesses that want to borrow with investors who may want to lend to them. “Banks are not based around getting businesses funding as quickly as possible.” In some ways the need for traditional banks to innovate may not seem obvious. The banking sector after all reported record earnings in the second quarter of this year. But such figures can be deceptive. The underlying profitability of banking is astonishingly weak compared with other industries. In simple dollar terms the banks’ latest profits may look large. But they were equivalent to only 1.1 percent of their assets in the 12 months through June according to an analysis of data from the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .  Wells Fargo  one of the nation’s top-performing banks managed to achieve 1.53 percent in its latest quarter.  Walmart ’s return on assets by contrast has been close to 9 percent in recent years. Banks have long relied on borrowing or levering up to amplify the profits for their shareholders. But the overhaul is restricting the use of leverage. Banks therefore have to think hard about how to squeeze more out of their assets — and have little choice but to innovate. A look at a simplified bank balance sheet shows just how the numbers are stacked against them. A bank with $100 of assets and $1 of profits has only a 1 percent return on those assets. But this bank borrows $95 which it uses to make loans and buy securities worth $100. The remaining $5 comes in the form of equity capital provided by the bank’s shareholders. Since profits theoretically go to shareholders investors also measure earnings as a percentage of outstanding capital to get a “return on equity.” In this case that $1 of profits would translate into a 20 percent return on the $5 of equity a solid return. But banks can become unstable when they skimp on equity capital and borrow too much. Equity is the part of a bank’s balance sheet that is supposed to absorb any losses from the bank’s assets. The crisis showed that banks’ equity was too thin for the losses they experienced. As a result the postcrisis regulations forced banks to substantially build up their capital. But that depresses returns for shareholders. If the bank with $5 of capital had to raise it to $10 the $1 in profits would translate into a 10 percent return on capital half of what it was before. For this bank the only way to get back to a 20 percent return would be to double profits from $1 to $2. Bankers don’t expect to get back to the sort of high returns on equity that they achieved before the crisis. But they recognize that they need to improve their returns or capital may gravitate to other sectors of the economy. “If you take a look at the return on equity that most financial institutions are producing these days” John Gerspach chief financial officer of  Citigroup  said in a public conference call in July “there’s reason to think that the profitability is really not enough to sustain continued investor involvement.” This is why banks have to look for new ways to bolster profits. The overhaul has already forced Wall Street to change how it performs one of its core activities. As investment banks adapt to new rules on capital and trading for instance they are holding much smaller inventories of securities for clients. That leaves them less vulnerable to losses that result from shocks in the markets. They are also devising new electronic trading platforms to connect buyers and sellers. Yet a leaner Wall Street was able to underwrite one of biggest booms ever in bond issuance over the last four years. Nor has the streamlining in market making led to hard times on Wall Street.  JPMorgan Chase ’s revenue from trading bonds and other “fixed income” instruments for example was $45 billion from 2010 to 2012. By comparison total revenue produced by all the divisions within JPMorgan’s investment bank from 2004 to 2006 was $46 billion. Financial firms in their efforts to be more efficient are also doing business with fewer employees. The number of people employed in financial activities has fallen 6 percent since the end of 2006 according to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics . The decline has occurred even as bank credit has risen considerably over that period despite the crisis. Still banks’ costs make up a higher proportion of their revenue than before the crisis according to a regular F.D.I.C. survey. To cut back further banks will be forced to stop money-losing activities like offering low-priced checking accounts and maintaining lavish branches. Banking specialists say restrictions on leverage will play a big role in persuading banks to cut back. “Leverage allowed banks not to care about the cost of their products and they gave them away for free” said Richard Ramsden a banking analyst at  Goldman Sachs . “That’s all gone.” The biggest challenge for banks is finding innovative ways to increase revenue. On this front banks have a patchy record. While banks have introduced products that have had a lasting and positive impact like A.T.M.’s and most credit cards they have also acted destructively. Before the crisis innovation meant finding new ways of lending aggressively to people with shakier credit histories which resulted in large losses when the loans went bad. Since then banks have focused almost exclusively on individuals with strong credit. To bolster returns however banks may have to start thinking hard once again about lending to borrowers with less certain prospects but in a way that does not lead to lending abuses and high losses. That is not an easy goal to achieve. Traditional banks say that the new rules as well as the legal risks make it too expensive for banks to find new ways of lending to riskier borrowers. In addition the government itself dominates the mortgage market. And in doing so it has brought down interest rates on home loans to a level that makes them unattractive for banks to hold. But banks may lose out to innovative new entrants if they don’t start becoming more adventurous in their lending. Executives from start-up firms say that fear is also one of the factors apparently holding banks back from lending to borrowers who do not have pristine creditworthiness. “Banks will only play in the most certain spaces in underwriting leaving a massive hole for other players to fill” said David Klein chief executive and a co-founder of Common Bond a young company that matches student borrowers with investors often alumni who may want to lend to them. “Banks are fearful” he said “New companies are fearless.” Fortis the biggest gas and electricity distribution utility in Canada agreed to buy UNS Energy Corporation at a 31 percent premium over the stock's closing price on Wednesday.

Driving into Iraq just after the 2003 invasion felt like driving into the future. We convoyed all day all night past Army checkpoints and burned-out tanks till in the blue dawn Baghdad rose from the desert like a vision of hell: Flames licked the bruised sky from the tops of refinery towers cyclopean monuments bulged and leaned against the horizon broken overpasses swooped and fell over ruined suburbs bombed factories and narrow ancient streets. With “shock and awe” our military had unleashed the end of the world on a city of six million — a city about the same size as Houston or Washington. The infrastructure was totaled: water power traffic markets and security fell to anarchy and local rule. The city’s secular middle class was disappearing squeezed out between gangsters profiteers fundamentalists and soldiers. The government was going down walls were going up tribal lines were being drawn and brutal hierarchies savagely established. I was a private in the United States Army. This strange precarious world was my new home. If I survived. Two and a half years later safe and lazy back in Fort Sill Okla. I thought I had made it out. Then I watched on television as Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans. This time it was the weather that brought shock and awe but I saw the same chaos and urban collapse I’d seen in Baghdad the same failure of planning and the same tide of anarchy.

But here’s the answer: you have to consider the interaction between the high likelihood of hysteresis and uncertainty about how much damage has been done so far. Suppose that sustained economic weakness really does do a lot of damage but that it hasn’t done as much  so far  as Wilcox et al estimate. In that case the worst possible thing you could do would be to slam on the brakes because you imagine that the economy is at capacity. You might well be braking much too soon — and in so doing imposing huge future costs on the economy. Or to put it another way you could be turning downbeat estimates of economic capacity into a self-fulfilling prophecy. The lesson you should be taking here is don’t tighten don’t taper don’t exit until you see the whites of inflation’s eyes. We don’t know how much capacity the economy has but we do have strong reason to suspect that running the economy below potential is a very very bad idea.

And it’s not even a novel in the normal sense but rather a mass confabulation that evaporates in front of us an astrological divination waning like the moon the first section 360 ­pages long (or are those degrees?) the last a mere sliver. But it’s a sliver that delivers.                             As Catton’s structural sphere wanes the growing darkness reveals a starscape that grows and turns and folds in on itself mystery upon enigma lie upon misunderstanding coincidence upon conspiracy all of it complete with astrological charts I was unable to understand but still loved to study. A score of major characters take turns as protagonist. They headline in set pieces and protracted scenes suffer shootings and poisonings enact strategic whoring survive storms at sea find treasure sewn in dresses lose the treasure find it again. We meet estranged brothers meddling clergymen swindling magnates investigative journalists Maori wise men confidence gamers Chinese prospectors (speaking in their own language). Finally we fall for those lovers I mentioned the two of them separated by fate and the machinations of men and oh how we wish them well amid disaster.                             It’s a lot of fun like doing a Charlotte Brontë-themed crossword puzzle while playing chess and Dance Dance Revolution on a Bongo Board. Some readers will delight in the challenge others may despair. I went both ways: always lost in admiration for this young New Zealander’s vast knowledge and narrative skill sometimes lost in her game wishing at times for more warmth delighted by her old-school chapter headings (“In which a stranger arrives . . . ”  “In which Quee Long brings a complaint before the law . . . ”) puzzled by her astrology Googling everything twice and three times scratching my head laughing out loud sighing with pleasure at sudden connections flipping back pages and chapters and whole sections for rereadings forging ahead with excitement renewed.                             The setting circa 1866 is the gold rush town of Hokitika in the wild southwest of New Zealand a place where the Maori had long sought greenstone. A type of jade as a quick Internet search reveals and holy. It took European settlers to notice the unholy gold great chunks of it wedged between boulders in the Hokitika River and more buried everywhere. The town is only a few years old but already there are mansions on the hillsides. And a jail in progress. A busy courthouse. And a newspaper. Ships coming in and out of a treacherous harbor daily sometimes foundering. Saloons in hotels alongside brothels and banks.                             The story opens naturally on a dark and stormy night with the shaken seaborne arrival of one Walter Moody a Scotsman trained in law but not yet a barrister nearly 28 years old (Eleanor Catton’s current age as it happens) here to make his fortune running away from bad fortune too. Even frazzled he’s very aware of the impression he makes and he manages it carefully: cool and collected trustworthy. Shipboard he has seen something he can’t explain a specter so horrible he can hardly bear to recall it.                             Safe at the scruffy Crown Hotel he seeks refuge in the smoking room and happens upon a meeting in progress 12 men with names as Dickensian as his own: Frost and Clinch and Mannering to name a few even a minister named Devlin. But each has a glancing connection to some aspect of an unstated crime. They meet to get their stories straight to put the pieces together to effect a happy ending to protect their interests joint and several.                             The dazzling narration arch as Jane Austen’s looks into Moody’s level head as he endeavors to discover what’s going on and whether the apparition he’s seen is part of the puzzle. He’s Sherlock Holmes he’s Joseph Conrad’s rational man. A conspiracy is in progress and Walter Moody prides himself on his grasp of people. Drinks are poured the billiards table goes quiet. One thing is not in doubt: A tale is about to be told.                             Thomas Balfour a shipping agent takes center stage becomes the mind of the story. Our omniscient narrator lets us listen to him awhile then apologizes for the man’s poor storytelling and offers to paraphrase help him get to the point. This deft strategy pushes Walter Moody aside and eventually allows glimpses into the minds of all the men in the room with their plentiful secrets and curious interlockings. We struggle along with Moody to put the facts in a line. Each man has a piece of the puzzle. Each is innocent each is guilty. No one is simple everyone’s got motives all construct their own moral universes each absolving himself.                Also in Video »

Died November 2 2013. Professor of Philosophy Edward F. McClennen was a passionate thinker and an unrepentant liberal. He contributed foundational work to the field of decision and game theory with over fifty articles and the highly influential book Rationality and Dynamic Choice: Foundational Explorations (Cambridge University Press 1990). He was truly an original philosopher who defended an unorthodox conception of rationality in the face of traditional theories of decision and game theory. He was a 'maverick' in his field as he would say. Ned believed that people could achieve extraordinary things by cooperating and devoted his later years to integrating economics and political philosophy in the service of a theory of a just civil society and government-- a Rational Society the title of his book manuscript. Born in Cambridge MA August 16 1936 Ned received a BA in philosophy from The University of Michigan in 1959 and a PhD from The Johns Hopkins University in 1968. He taught at Purdue University Lehman College CUNY Washington University Bowling Green State University The London School of Economics and Syracuse University and was a visiting professor at Harvard University The University of Pittsburgh Rutgers University The University of Rochester The University of Western Ontario and The University of Amsterdam. At Bowling Green as the Ohio Board of Regents Eminent Scholar in Moral and Social Philosophy he was co-developer of a program funded by UNESCO the Kennan Institute and others that brought young Central and Eastern European scholars to the US after the collapse of the Soviet Union as a means helping them understand the relevance of new institutional economic theory for their reemerging nations. As Centennial Professor of Philosophy at The London School of Economics he designed and administered a highly successful interdisciplinary Masters Program in Philosophy Policy and Social Values. From 2005-2007 he participated in a group of international scholars who were brought to Libya by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi to help in the writing of a new Constitution for which Ned drafted the Bill of Rights. As many would attest Ned was a gracious host who loved company. He enjoyed cooking fine food to share with others over long evenings of spirited conversation. He also loved art a legacy from the George De Forest Brush side of the family and he treasured the view of Pleasant Bay from the McClennen family home on Cape Cod. He is survived by his wife Ellen Esrock and his children Nathaniel Esrock McClennen and Sarah Pearmain McClennen.                Also in T Magazine »

201,100000002544475,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,ncaafootball,Alabama Reminds Everyone It’s No. 1,GREG BISHOP,1185,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/sports/ncaafootball/alabama-reminds-everyone-its-no-1.html,1,TUSCALOOSA Ala.  Alabama Coach Nick Saban jumped toward his quarterback held on tight let go turned toward the home tunnel at Bryant-Denny Stadium and began to jog.         Behind Saban ran security guards and behind them ran photographers and cameramen. Saban held aloft his right index finger and waved at the assembled in the stands. He looked basically how most expect Saban not to look: emotional content even giddy.         As Saban jogged off the field Saturday he smiled and not briefly but widely and for the entirety of his jog. This was a man who lamented the time he lost to recruit this off-season because of his national championship obligations a man for whom his famous process is more bible than buzzword. His team had pulled away from Louisiana State to win 38-17 to remain undefeated and here Saban allowed himself a moment emphasis on a.         Shortly afterward he stood before reporters as the final stragglers headed for the exits. It was again all about the process. The four giant video boards played his news conference the camera closed in tight. Here was a football higher power the voice of an Alabama football God four Sabans preaching simultaneously to an emptying stadium and anyone in earshot.         I thought we played better in the second half he said back on script.         Alabama (9-0 6-0 Southeastern Conference) thrives on script to the point where games and wins and seasons like this become expected to the point where the D-word as in dynasty gets thrown around.         Not that everyone had forgotten about Alabama football it being of course Alabama football but the Crimson Tide spent much of last month trapped in a contradiction. They remained at once locked atop the rankings and a step or two from the spotlight.         Alabama continued forward turning a string of lackluster matchups into a series of lopsided victories. If those games and a stretch of three national championships in the past four seasons resulted in some Alabama fatigue in annual dominance taken for granted the Crimson Tide could ignore the relative quiet and polish its hardware.         Louisiana State (7-3 3-3) came to town Saturday and while the hype around this contest did not mirror the Game of the Century narrative from two years ago the Tigers had won five of their last six games at Alabama which had stumbled once in November in each of the past two seasons. That provided enough intrigue even if it did not last.         On Saturday Alabama so dominated that it deserved one of those overly-enthusiastic rapid-fire claps from Les Miles the Tigers coach. Quarterback A. J. McCarron threw three touchdown passes; running back T. J. Yeldon sprinted in for two scores; and Alabamas defense sloppy in the first half stiffened as the game went on.         As Saban assessed all that the hug naturally came up in the news conference. He looked down at the podium. Look man A. J. and I have been through a lot Saban said. Some of it you have seen on TV and some of it you havent.         Earlier in the week undefeated Baylor decimated Oklahoma and Stanford upended undefeated Oregon. That meant the weekend ended with four no-loss teams toward the top of the Bowl Championship Series rankings: Florida State Ohio State Baylor and of course Alabama which gave no reason to believe it is not the most formidable of all. Again.         As kickoff approached senses here were assaulted. The video boards played tributes. Loudspeakers blared country music. Fans waved white towels and sang Sweet Home Alabama and walked right up near the team bench the path between the first row and the sideline paved like a courtyard lined with shrubbery and marked by a fence. Even the band  announced as the $1 Million Band  came onto the field to entrance music.         Here was Alabama doing Alabama where one password for a stadium wireless network provided a simply summary of the mind-set at the intersection of arrogant and confident. It was: Champion! and with an exclamation point.                Also in Video »       
202,100000002544473,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Two Men Shot at Bryant Park Skating Rink,DANIEL E. SLOTNIK;KENAN CHRISTIANSEN,391,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/nyregion/bryant-park-shooting.html,28,Pandemonium broke out in the heart of ManhattanÂ on SaturdayÂ when two men were shot on the ice at the popular Bryant Park skating rink just afterÂ 11 p.m. the police said.         One man was shot in the torso and one in the leg. Both were recovering at Bellevue Hospital Center.         A skater Francis 17 who gave only his first name said he was behind one of the victims when the shots were fired. He said the shooter was standing among tourists who were taking pictures outside of the rink. Then he pulled a gun.         He took out a gun and was scanning for him with his eyes and then he shot him three times and ran he said. People around me fell to the ice. I fell down too. Then I got up and ran to the railing like everyone else.         Many of the more than 50 skaters dropped to the ice and others fled screaming tearing through the holiday shops in Bryant Park carrying their rented skates with only socks covering their feet. Many tried to escape through the skate rental tent but were delayed when they were asked to present claim tickets to recover their bags.         Christopher Guerrero 19 was on the ice at the time. He said that one of the victims was a friend of his a young man named Adonis who lived near him on 160th Street.         I didnt see no blood Mr. Guerrero said. I asked Are you O.K.? and he said I cant feel my legs.          Dozens of police officers ran onto the ice accompanied by paramedics. A young woman with long hair wailed clutching a metal police barricade just outside the rink.         My brother just got shot in front of my face! she moaned as a friend tried to comfort her.         People at the scene said most of the skaters appeared to be teenagers.         The Bryant Park ice rink is Manhattans only free skating venue though skaters must rent skates if they do not have their own. The rink which opened Nov. 1 and is a popular destination for tourists is open untilÂ midnightÂ on Fridays and Saturdays.         AtÂ midnight a wedding party filed out of the Bryant Park Grill a tony restaurant that overlooks the ice skating rink. Â AtÂ 12:45 police led a man out of the park in handcuffs.

In 2003 Ms. Lavietes was driving on a parkway near Greenwich Conn. when she spotted a blue Saab with a license plate that read: Mdlfcrss (Midlife crisis). She rolled her eyes and let it pass but not before catching a glimpse of the driver a man who appeared to be deep in thought.         In February 2009 Ms. Lavietes received a message from JDate the Jewish singles website matching her with a man whose screen name was Vita Brevis (Life is short in Latin).

Mr. Taranto who was born in Turkey and grew up in Europe and South America was married at the time although he had separated from his wife of 30 years in 2003. She sent him a message and Mr. Taranto whose divorce was not final until January 2010 recalled being taken by her looks  specifically her red glasses and salt-and-pepper hair  and replied. After a brief exchange they made plans to meet for lunch in Manhattan the next day which happened to be Valentines Day.         The attraction was immediate and lunch extended into dinner. He drove back to his home in Larchmont N.Y. The next day he returned to Manhattan to drive Ms. Lavietes who had spent the night at her brothers apartment in the city to New Haven.         On the way he stopped at his house. As they approached the driveway Ms. Lavietes noticed a blue Saab in the driveway. The license plate read Mdlfcrss.         Youre that jerk! she said. They laughed as Ms. Lavietes told him how she had seen him on the parkway so many years before.         Mr. Taranto still has the blue Saab but his plates now say Vitabrev.          MARGAUX LASKEY

I said 50s and 60s and she then asked would I date someone a little older. I said Sure age doesnt really matter to me who do you have in mind? When she said her dad I got chills up and down my spine.         A few days later Mr. Millstein called Ms. Frame and invited her to his Midtown office which overlooks Central Park.         My daughter suggested that I call and I was pretty lonely at the time so I was very pleased with the idea said Mr. Millstein whose wife Diane had died that September after a long illness.         I thought Susan was a nice person; her good looks and everything else is secondary to that Mr. Millstein said. I just sort of cottoned to her.         A week later they set up a first date at a restaurant in Larchmont N.Y. not far from where they were living. They discussed family friends and career with Mr. Millstein learning that Ms. Frame for the better part of her career had been a stock trader in New York.         We were very comfortable with each other Mr. Millstein said. I found her very attractive and while the age difference does bother me it is what it is. Shes comfortable Im comfortable; thats the only thing that counts.         They began dating steadily and he proposed this past St. Patricks Day. Just after she said yes he picked up the telephone and called her parents to tell them the good news.         The best part about her being in my life is that we share everything Mr. Millstein said. When I get up in the morning I have to have someone to talk to or else Ill do something crazy during the day.  VINCENT M.

230,100000002543069,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,,Calls Grow to Shut Down the Pegasus Pipeline for Good,JIM MALEWITZ,613,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/us/calls-grow-to-shut-down-the-pegasus-pipeline-for-good.html,31A,GUN BARREL CITY  For more than eight decades Jim Howell was hardly one to cause a political ruckus. But this spring he realized that a crude-oil superhighway ran through his backyard just two feet below his patchy lawn and seven feet beyond a newly built porch.         At first I felt guilty and stupid Mr. Howell said about discovering that the 20-inch-wide pipeline passed so close to his compact brick house.         Guilt became alarm as he read more about it and as people from ExxonMobil its operator showed up to add a row of yellow-and-black- striped warning markers. The pipeline Pegasus was the same one that ruptured about 280 miles northeast in March spewing at least 210000 gallons of heavy Canadian crude into neighborhood streets in Mayflower Ark.         Now at 83 Mr. Howell admits to having become an activist even if he is not particularly fond of the label. Loosely organized by two local citizens action groups Mr. Howell and others in this small Henderson County town  whose official motto is We Shoot Straight With You  make up a small but growing pocket of East Texans who are asking federal regulators to shut down the pipeline permanently. The 65-year-old pipeline which runs from Patoka Ill. to Nederland Tex. has been turned off since the spill while ExxonMobil complies with a corrective-action order from the United States Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.         Pegasus is not the only major pipeline to concern landowners and environmentalists in Texas a state crisscrossed by close to 59000 miles of hazardous liquids lines according to the latest federal tally. That does not include the proposed  Keystone XL  expansion which has roiled United States politics. Compared with train and truck traffic pipelines are generally seen as the safest way to transport fuel. But the Pegasus accident was a vivid example of what could go wrong.         Agency and ExxonMobil representatives say they have no timeline for reactivating the pipeline.         We will not restart it until we are satisfied it is safe to do so and have the approval of P.H.M.S.A. said Aaron Stryk an ExxonMobil spokesman. We are committed to understanding the factors that led to the release in Mayflower and are working to ensure an incident like this does not happen again.         But pipeline opponents received a boost Wednesday when the pipeline agency sent ExxonMobil a notice of probable violation which alleged that the company had committed a number of violations in testing and analyzing the pipeline before the spill. The agency proposed a $2.6 million fine. The notice laid out extra steps ExxonMobil was required to take which would probably further delay reactivation.         The pipelines critics are particularly concerned about the lines age which studies say leaves it vulnerable to cracking and corrosion if it is not maintained.         These pipelines were built under codes that were ancient said Evan Vokes an industry whistle-blower who worked for the pipeline builder TransCanada until 2012. ExxonMobil officials say they take necessary precautions and follow all federal maintenance rules.         Opponents also worry about the type of crude that had been running through it diluted bitumen  a black tarlike substance mixed with benzene and other liquids propellants that if spilled is particularly difficult to clean up. It gets your adrenaline going because you dont want that happening to you said Mayor Paul Eaton of Gun Barrel City.         The biggest fear he said is that Pegasus will rupture along a stretch below the Cedar Creek Reservoir formed along the Trinity River which Gun Barrel City and its neighbors depend on for drinking water and recreation. A polluted lake would be devastating to this community he said. Were talking about peoples lives.         jmalewitz@texastribune.org
231,100000002544437,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,basketball,Pacers&#8217; Boldness Underscores the Nets&#8217; Shortage of It ,ANDREW KEH,812,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/sports/basketball/nets-fail-to-match-the-moxie-of-the-pacers.html,5,There could hardly have been a less opportune time for  the Nets  a team still trying to find itself and forge a unified identity to encounter the  Indiana Pacers  a club so obviously comfortable in its own tough skin.         Displaying a menacing self-assuredness the Pacers marched into sold-out Barclays Center on Saturday  to dispatch the still-hesitant Nets 96-91 . It was a taut game at times but gaffes and timid spells materialized far too often for the Nets who watched their record fall to 2-4 as they took their first loss at home.         The victory for the Pacers (7-0) ensured that they would remain the leagues lone unbeaten team. They have been on an ascendant path for some time and the teams performance Saturday exposed the current advantage it enjoys over the Nets a talented group that maintains a cobbled-together feel.         Theyre a pretty good team right now said Nets shooting guard Joe Johnson who missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer with 11.8 seconds left and were still a team thats learning on the fly.         The Nets interpersonal learning process was always going to feel stunted during this game. The Pacers season-opening streak has been built on suffocating defense. Through their first six games they were allowing opponents 87.5 points per 100 possessions easily the leagues best figure.         The consolation is that the season remains young. The two clubs entered the season expected to be among the few able to challenge the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference. Â          I dont care what Brooklyns record is; theyre going to be there down the stretch said Frank Vogel the Pacers coach. Theyre just beginning to jell. Its a long season and this was a big-time win.         Vogel said the game had a playoff vibe and things did get tense during the closing minutes. The Nets were leading 46-44 starting the second half but they allowed the Pacers to put together a 16-5 run. Then the Nets getting some hard work from their second unit scratched and clawed to stay within striking distance.         Victory seemed possible when Paul Pierce hit a 3-pointer with 4 minutes 5 seconds left in the fourth quarter that cut the Pacers lead to 90-85. It was an unlikely shot  it deflected high off the back iron and bounced four times around the inside rim before falling through the net  and it sent a jolt through the crowd. Pierce gazed toward the rafters and pumped his fists.         The final seconds were ticking away and the Nets were trailing 94-91 when Johnson came off a screen to find an open look from behind the 3-point line. But his shot was just long pinging off the back of the rim to hasten the games end.         It felt good said Johnson who produced a smart and efficient 17-point night. It just didnt go down.         Once complete though the result felt fair given how smoothly the Pacers deployed their various weapons. Paul George glided around to a seemingly effortless 24-point performance leading all scorers. David West added 18 points and Roy Hibbert contributed 15 points and 11 rebounds. As the group the Pacers hustled their way to 20 second-chance points.         The Nets on the other hand looked untidy. Pierce scored 15 points but shot just 5 for 12 from the field and had five turnovers. Brook Lopez (16 points) found a worthy opponent in Hibbert a big man who could match his strength and mass who would not budge when bumped.         Were not panicking said Pierce who speculated that the Nets coming trip to the West Coast might help them clear their heads.         There were positive flashes for the Nets. Mason Plumlee a rookie provided some noticeable energy during his 15:38 on the floor. In the second quarter he ran himself ragged up and down the court was scrappy under the basket and contributed 6 hard-won points and 3 rebounds.         Deron Williams who had a delayed start to the season after spraining his ankle during the summer looked sharper and more aggressive than he had in previous games getting a season-high 17 points and 10 assists. But he made some mistakes too fouling George on a 3-point attempt and committing a sloppy turnover in quick succession within the last minute and a half.         Williams understood that the frequent talk about the learning process might be getting stale. While he emphasized that the Nets still needed some time he said the players felt an urgency to right the ship.         I dont want it to seem like were content with losing because were not Williams said. Weve got to figure it out soon.         REBOUNDS         Andrei Kirilenko was inactive Saturday. He experienced a recurrence of back spasms Coach Jason Kidd said. Kirilenko 32 has never seemed to be at full strength this season; after sitting out the opener he averaged just 13.3 minutes over the next four games.        
232,100000002543067,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,,Concerns as Austin Residents Drill New Wells,NEENA SATIJA;JAY ROOT,1041,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/us/concerns-as-residents-drill-new-wells.html,31A,With what has been described as the worst drought in recorded history punishing parts of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott found a way to keep watering his yard without risking fines or incurring huge monthly bills: he drilled his own well.         Now his lawn is green and there are no pesky city watering restrictions to worry about.         He is not alone. Mr. Abbott the leading 2014 candidate for Texas governor has joined an exclusive and growing list of Austin residents. That list includes Ben Crenshaw the golfing legend and Mack Brown the University of Texas football coach  residents who are coping with the drought and rising water bills by procuring their own private water supply underneath their land.         But the trend is worrying city leaders and environmentalists who fear that the rise in well drilling in rapidly growing Austin will negatively affect limited groundwater supplies reduce the flow into rivers and discourage conservation.         To me its just unconscionable. Its a total disregard for the resource said Andrew Sansom executive director of the Meadows Center for Water and the Environment at Texas State University. What we should be doing is reducing our consumption of water. (The Texas State University System is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)         Mr. Abbott installed his well a few months before the city began aggressively enforcing its lawn-watering restrictions issuing at least $11000 in fines since August. In Mr. Abbotts upscale West Austin neighborhood of Pemberton Heights where lawns are remarkably green some residents have put up signs that read Watering by Private Well to avoid reproach at a time when most of Austin can water grass only once a week.         Mr. Abbott and others who have drilled their own wells say they have a right to the water under their land and contend it is a better way keep their grass green. After all is it not preferable to put well water on the lawn instead of the scarcer treated drinking water provided by the city?         Austin has no power to stop landowners from drilling water underneath their own terrain in pro-property-rights Texas. It can only monitor the proliferation of private wells which Jason Hill an Austin Water Utility spokesman said officials are doing vigorously.         The City Council recently passed an ordinance requiring water well owners to register with the city and pay an annual fee of $90. So far 314 wells are on file and dozens more residents have submitted their intent to drill but the city estimates that more than 500 existing wells have yet to register.         Were taking steps to see that were conscious of those wells said Greg Meszaros director of Austin Water Utility. But he was quick to add Were respecting Texas property rights.         The tension between property rights interests and the management of underwater resources is sure to increase in Texas politics as the drought continues to take its toll on the states surface water supplies. With the major reservoirs supplying Austin holding just over a third of their capacity growing cities and industries are looking to groundwater to quench their thirst.         But the resource is hardly managed in some areas of the state including Austin. While state legislators have set up nearly 100 entities elsewhere to regulate groundwater Texas capital city goes by the century-old rule of capture. According to the rule Mr. Abbott can pump the water under his land as much as he likes even if a neighbors well were to go dry as a result  as long as he is not intentionally wasteful or malicious.         A Texas civil appeals court in El Paso famously upheld the rule of capture in 1954 for the father of Clayton Williams a 1990 candidate for governor. Clayton Williams Sr. pumped so much water under his land that a popular Fort Stockton spring went dry but justices ruled that he was within his rights because underground water supplies belong to the landowner and may be used by him at his will.         nsatija@texastribune.org jroot@texastribune.org

234,100000002543145,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,,"Losses Follow Crowded Races, but That’s Fine",ROSS RAMSEY,763,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/us/losses-follow-crowded-races-but-thats-fine.html,31A, Ross Ramsey the managing editor of The Texas Tribune writes a regular column for the Tribune.   Some of the big shots on the 2014 ballot are people whose names you wont be able to remember in five or 10 years.         Some will climb the ladder but others are destined for the chutes.         Four elected officials  three in statewide office one a state senator  are running for lieutenant governor. Three are going home.         Three more  a statewide official and two legislators  are in a Republican primary for attorney general. The same math is at work in the comptrollers race although one of the elected officials in that race Glenn Hegar would get to keep his State Senate seat if voters denied him a promotion.         The primaries are just the beginning of the yearlong cutting contest. At least one current officeholder will not survive the governors race.         It happens from time to time. A pack of politicians arrive at the same point of their careers at the same time. They might be friends. They might have appeared on the same tickets together. But this is business.         The top jobs in Texas government have belonged to Republicans for a couple of decades and the turnover has been pretty light. The combination of a bunch of open seats and a horde of ambitious folks who have been waiting faking patience means the candidates are now free to grab at the jobs they covet.         Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson and Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples have been on the same statewide ballot a couple of times. Theyre joined by State Senator Dan Patrick who Mr. Dewhurst put in charge of the Senates education committee. The four men are now in an uncomfortable contest for Mr. Dewhursts job. Three will go home to retirement back to work to a place where each can plot his next political move if he still has the urge.         Losers go home to stay sometimes and sometimes return. In 1998 Paul Hobby a Democrat lost a close race for comptroller and has not run since. Only one of the last five Democrats who ran for governor re-entered the fray. Chris Bell a former member of Congress lost the governors race in 2006 and then lost a State Senate race in 2008.         Someone in here will be a big winner eventually inside or outside of public office.         Some losers come back. Mr. Patterson lost a race for land commission to Mr. Dewhurst in 1998 but he won the seat in 2002 when Mr. Dewhurst ran successfully for lieutenant governor.         Others move on to prominent nonelected positions. When Kent Hance and Phil Gramm two Democratic congressmen from Texas rose to national prominence for carrying legislation that put Ronald Reagans economic program on track they seemed bound for great things. They ended up in the same pack running for the same United States Senate seat. Mr. Gramm landed in the Senate. Mr. Hance served on the Railroad Commission and tried and failed to win the governorship. But he landed fine: He is ending his public career after several years as chancellor at the Texas Tech University System.         A few years after that another cluster of former friends and ticket mates arrived at the platform at the same time. Two of them  Aggies John Sharp a Democrat and Rick Perry a Republican  landed in a hard-fought 1998 race for lieutenant governor. Mr. Perry won and you know the rest of that story so far. Mr. Sharp lost a second race for lieutenant governor in 2002 but later made up with Mr. Perry and is now chancellor of the Texas A & M University System.         Like Mr. Hance it was not a bad landing but not quite what he had in mind.         Maybe those two and Mr. Bell and Bill White and Tom Leppert and Kay Bailey Hutchison and Jack Fields and Mike Andrews and Carole Keeton and Garry Mauro and Pat Hill can set up a self-help group for rising political stars derailed by elections. They can talk about what its like to be knocked off the elected ladder after a successful run as a comptroller a congressman a mayor a senator or a land commissioner. They can talk about the ones who walked away from politics and did fine in other endeavors or the ones who lost and then fought their way back to the top  phoenixes like Lincoln Johnson Nixon both Bushes and the Clintons.         Theyll have a large roster of new members after next years primaries.         rramsey@texastribune.org        Also in T Magazine »       
235,100000002544048,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,politics,"As Washington Keeps Sinking, Governors Rise",ADAM NAGOURNEY;JONATHAN MARTIN,1530,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/us/politics/as-washington-keeps-sinking-governors-rise.html,1,LOS ANGELES  Washington these days is the symbol of governmental failure rocked by a shutdown legislative paralysis and the disastrous debut of President Obamas health care program. Public opinion of Mr. Obama and members of Congress is on a steady decline.         But something different is taking place in statehouses.         At a time when Mr. Obama and members of Congress are mired in partisanship and gridlock many governors  including  Chris Christie  of New Jersey a Republican who was re-elected by an overwhelming margin on Tuesday and the chief executives of such states as Arkansas California Nevada New Mexico New York and Ohio  are showing that it is possible to be successful in elected office even in this era.         These governors are at least by comparison to lawmakers in Washington capable and popular leaders pushing through major legislation and trying to figure out ways with mixed success to avoid the partisan wrangling that has come to symbolize Washington.         Part of this is cyclical. As a rule governors look bad during an economic downturn as they are identified with spending cuts or tax increases to balance budgets and are bold and in command during an economic rebound. And some governors are certainly struggling be it Gov.  Rick Scott  of Florida a Republican who  failed to get his Legislature  to back him on expanding  Medicaid  coverage or Gov.  Pat Quinn  of Illinois a Democrat who is widely unpopular after a failed effort to change pension laws there.         Yet the contrast these days appears as strong as any in memory reflecting not only the breakdown in Washington but also a particularly activist class of governors often empowered by having a legislature controlled by a single party as they enact the kind of crisp agenda that has eluded both parties in Washington.         Right now governors are the most popular political players in the country mainly because of the dysfunction in Washington and because the public perceives governors as being bipartisan pragmatic and able to work things out said  Bill Richardson  a former governor of New Mexico and Democratic candidate for president in 2008. Governors are the hot political items right now.         The difference is reflected in polling. In the latest CBS News poll 85 percent of respondents expressed disapproval of the performance of Congress and 49 percent expressed disapproval of Mr. Obama. By contrast less than a third of respondents in a variety of state polls said they disapproved of the performance of governors like Mr. Christie;  Jerry Brown  of California a Democrat;  Bill Haslam  of Tennessee a Republican; and  Mike Beebe  of Arkansas a Democrat.         Many governors said they were intent on making certain that their political parties were not defined entirely by their compatriots in the nations capital. Mr. Christie who will take over leadership of the  Republican Governors Association  this month said in an interview that it was especially imperative that Republicans not be defined by their deeply unpopular congressional wing.         We all talk about the fact that were actually accomplishing things and the people in Washington D.C. are frustrating people said Mr. Christie recounting his conversations with other Republican governors. We need to be out there talking about our successes to help to build the brand of our party nationally beyond the capitals and have it replace the Washington D.C. brand.         The disparity could have implications for the 2016 presidential race. It suggests some of the challenges that Hillary Rodham Clinton a former senator and secretary of state could face should she end up running against a governor like Mr. Christie. Historically governors have tended to be much more successful presidential candidates even at moments when animosity toward Washington has not been at this level.         Governors of course have always loved to beat up on Congress  drawing arguably self-serving chest-thumping comparisons  and rarely more than these days. When you look at D.C. now a member will write a letter call for a hearing and theyll call that a day said Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri a Democrat.         Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio a Republican who served more than 20 years in Congress ticked off a list of what he viewed as his main accomplishments as governor: pulling the state out of a deep deficit investing in road building without federal assistance and overseeing a significant increase in employment.         Whats not to like right? Mr. Kasich said. And they cant even pass a highway bill there.         Mr. Brown who has been widely praised for pushing through laws on education taxes and the environment in California said in an interview that in all 50 states there is more dynamism and more openness and more capacity to deal with change to deal with problems.         Even before the advent of this era of sharp partisanship governors have proved to be more successful in getting programs passed.  Thad Kousser  an associate professor of political science at the University of California San Diego and co-author of  The Power of American Governors  estimated that governors won approval of more than half of their initiatives compared with 45 percent for presidents.         Governors have the latitude to make their own policy in their own state Professor Kousser said. They dont have to go back to Washington D.C. and toe their party line on these issues. If they want to conduct immigration they conduct immigration. If they want to stay away from gay rights they can do that.         Governors and analysts pointed to a host of reasons state executives are faring better than members of Congress. For one thing they are forced to work more closely with their legislatures if only because of the close confinement of the states and capitals said Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico a Republican. The lack of relationship building the lack of conversation the lack of problem solving  people are tired of that she said.         Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado a Democrat said the constraints and powers of governors can prompt them to act responsibly and in theory enhance their own leadership credentials.         Most states require a balanced budget and forbid the state to take on debt he said. That eliminates some of the pitfalls and the problems in the federal government.         Adam Nagourney reported from Los Angeles and Jonathan Martin from Washington.

236,100000002544105,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,,Con Men Prey on Confusion Over Health Care Act,JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG;SUSANNE CRAIG,1179,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/business/con-men-prey-on-confusion-over-health-care-act.html,1,To the list of problems plaguing President Obamas  health care law  add one more  fraud.         With millions of Americans frustrated and bewildered by the trouble-prone federal website for  health insurance  con men and unscrupulous marketers are seizing their chance. State and federal authorities report a rising number of consumer complaints ranging from deceptive sales practices to  identity theft  linked to the Affordable Care Act.         Madeleine Mirzayans was fooled when a man posing as a government official knocked on her door. Barbara Miller and Maevis Ethan were pitched by telemarketers who claimed to work for  Medicaid . And Buford Price was almost caught by another trap: websites that look official but are actually bait set by fly-by-night insurance operators.         Some level of fraud or abuse is predictable with any big government program and administration officials expected a few bad actors to emerge. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.; Kathleen Sebelius the secretary of health and human services; Edith Ramirez the chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission; and other officials met at the White House in September to discuss possible pitfalls.         But now the technical failures troubling the  HealthCare.gov  website as well as the laws complexity threaten to make matters worse. Only a tiny fraction of Americans have been affected so far but state authorities and the F.T.C. are reviewing the issue aggressively.         With this changing health insurance landscape there is a new opportunity for people to take advantage of our residents and weve seen it starting already said Kate Abernathy a spokeswoman at the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance.         While it is difficult to quantify the problem interviews with authorities in states including California Florida Illinois and New York suggest that fraud is a growing worry. Websites are particularly difficult to police.         We are remaining vigilant since we anticipated that the law was so complex that scam artists would take advantage of it said Tom Miller the attorney general of Iowa. In New York and Illinois attorneys general are investigating at least two firms that they suspect of fraud according to people briefed on the matter. Since October attorney general offices in 36 states have been holding conference calls about the emerging dangers every two weeks.         The most prevalent complaints involve older Americans. Under the law people age 65 and over who are on  Medicare  do not need to buy supplemental coverage. Nonetheless some marketers are pushing expensive add-on policies by falsely claiming that such coverage is required state authorities say. Others are telling people that the law means they need new Medicare cards  not true. And still others are charging fees as high as $100 to help people navigate the new insurance landscape.         And then there are those who are creating websites that resemble state health care exchanges. Visitors to those websites with addresses like  NewHampshireHealthExchange.com  say they are inundated with pitches from private insurance agents unaffiliated with the government.         Authorities warn that in some cases the come-ons are merely a ruse to get people to divulge sensitive Medicare and banking information. The pitches usually come with a telephone call or knock at the door. Someone claiming to be a government official offers help or warns residents that their Medicare cards are about to expire. Then the hook is set.         To Ms. Mirzayans 68 the caller sounded so official that she agreed to meet him the next day at her home in Sherman Oaks Calif. He told her the law meant she would have to update her Medicare card. Ms. Mirzayans a retired small-business owner was grateful that the government was taking such interest in her insurance coverage.         Over glasses of pomegranate juice last month Ms. Mirzayans divulged to her visitor crucial Medicare  Social Security  and personal information. Only after the man left without giving her a business card did she grow suspicious.         I just feel so foolish and betrayed said Ms. Mirzayans who reported the incident to state authorities.         She is hardly alone. Across the country volunteers with  Senior Medicare Patrol  a government program that works with older Americans to root out health care fraud say they have been deluged with calls for assistance. The typical complaints are from retirees who said they had handed over bank account information to callers claiming to be from Medicare.         Anne Gray a project coordinator in California with the Senior Medicare Patrol said Such calls have doubled in recent months.         Ms. Miller and Ms. Ethan both of whom live in California said they also received calls from people urging them to update their Medicare cards in light of the new law. Neither fell for the ploy.         In Kentucky Elsie Burdon 70 said she knew she had slipped up almost as soon as she hung up the phone. She had divulged her Medicare information and Social Security number. Ms. Burdon of Jenkins Ky. said the caller assured her that Medicare was changing inquired about her  diabetes  and even asked about her shoe size.         I thought it was odd Ms. Burdon said adding that she immediately contacted her bank and state authorities. Days later she got a flood of other marketing calls. I cant even keep track she said. First it was a Joe then an Ashley and then at least six other people all claiming to be from the government.         Anyone young or old can be targeted by the unscrupulous marketers. But older people  whether because of age their tendency to be at home often or other factors  are particularly vulnerable. Medicare has also long been a magnet for swindlers thanks to its sheer scale and complexity. The troubled rollout of the new health care law has amplified the problem.         The scammers are deploying traditional Medicare cons but wrapping them in the Affordable Health Care Act said James Quiggle of Coalition Against Insurance Fraud a Washington-based nonprofit.         With all the problems surrounding the federal websites it can be even more difficult for consumers to navigate. In October New Hampshires insurance commissioner hit the operator of NewHampshireHealthExchange.com an insurance provider in Arizona with a cease-and-desist order.         Lisa Madigan the Illinois attorney general is investigating a website over concerns that it is a lead generator for insurance providers not registered to do business within the state the people briefed said.         New Yorks Department of Financial Services is also investigating potential fraud.         Mr. Price 75 who lives in Willis Tex. concedes he is not technology-proficient. I dont do the Internet he said. But he was surprised at how quickly a wrong turn on the web led to a barrage of marketing calls. While he and a friend were watching football one recent Sunday the friend entered Mr. Prices name and phone number into a pop-up window that appeared when Mr. Price was perusing an official-looking government website. Roughly five minutes later Mr. Price said his cellphone rang.         On the line Mr. Price said was a man who offered to come by his house the next day. Mr. Price declined  but got three more calls later that week.         I know the Internet is fast Mr. Price said but this was something else.

The journalist Jim Wyss is the Andes region bureau chief for The Miami Herald. He was detained Thursday near  Venezuela s western border with Colombia while on a reporting trip.         In a telephone interview in Caracas where he was released Mr. Wyss said the authorities who had questioned him never explained to him why he had been detained. He said that he had been treated well and that he would be allowed to remain in Venezuela and continue his work as a journalist.         Officials with the Information Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.         Mr. Wyss lives in BogotÃ¡ Colombia but periodically visits Venezuela.         He said he was detained on Thursday in San CristÃ³bal a western city after going to a National Guard site to seek information for an article.         They decided to dig deeper into who I was Mr. Wyss said. He was first handed over to military intelligence officers and eventually to immigration officials he said. He was brought to Caracas on Friday.         I think the release could be an acknowledgment that I wasnt doing anything wrong Mr. Wyss said. I think there was a lot of tension along the border and I got scooped up in it. It became clear to them I was just a reporter trying to do a job.         Venezuela is struggling with economic problems including a 54 percent annual inflation rate and shortages of basic goods. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro says right-wing enemies here in Colombia and in the United States are waging an economic war against his socialist government.         He and other officials have suggested that the local and foreign news media are conspiring against the government.         In a television appearance last week the information minister Delcy RodrÃ­guez said several news media outlets including The Miami Herald and The New York Times portrayed Venezuela as a country in crisis. She accused the international news media of following this script of a continuous and silent coup in Venezuela.                Also in Video »       
238,100000002521421,0,Article,News,World,world,africa,Storied Party of Mandela Faces South Africa Unrest,LYDIA POLGREEN,1063,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/world/africa/storied-party-of-mandela-faces-south-africa-unrest.html,6,MARIKANA South Africa  When Alton Dalasile got his first job as a miner in the late 1980s he immediately joined the National Union of Mineworkers a powerful organization that not only fought for workers rights but also battled the brutal system of racial segregation known as apartheid. When his unions political ally the African National Congress was on the ballot in 1994 in South Africas first fully democratic election Mr. Dalasile enthusiastically cast his ballot for Nelson Mandela the countrys first black president.         Last year Mr. Dalasile gave up on his union amid a violent season of wildcat strikes that ended with 34 miners being gunned down by the police here in August and joined a radical upstart union that accused the old guard of selling out to mine bosses. Now Mr. Dalasile is contemplating what was once unthinkable: voting against the African National Congress in elections next year.         They have abandoned and betrayed us Mr. Dalasile said. The A.N.C. is no longer the party of the poor man the working man. They care only about enriching themselves.         Next year South Africa will hold elections for its National Assembly which elects the countrys president. Twenty years after the end of apartheid when the African National Congress swept to power on a wave of international good will Mr. Mandelas party is facing perhaps its fiercest electoral challenge yet.         The elections will take place in the shadow of the killings here in Marikana a flash point many have likened to apartheid-era massacres that spurred the fight against white rule. Only this time the police officers and the politicians who led them were almost entirely black. The A.N.C. government accused of slaughtering unarmed protesters responded by charging the striking miners with the murder of their colleagues.         The partys handling of the strike and its aftermath along with allegations of cronyism and corruption at the highest levels of leadership have led to widespread frustration with the A.N.C. and a crop of new political players is trying to ride the wave of discontent.         Julius Malema the firebrand who led the partys youth league until he was expelled this year for sowing disunity has started his own political party the Economic Freedom Fighters.         He began the party at a giant rally here last month to cheers of adulation striking a hard-line pose in a red beret like his self-proclaimed hero the former Venezuelan president Hugo ChÃ¡vez as he called for the nationalization of mines and the seizing of white-owned property.         We must restore the dignity of the black majority he declared to a crowd of thousands. Now is the time to deliver on the promises of 1994.         Despite his popularity Mr. Malema may not be the best-placed candidate to challenge the A.N.C. on issues of corruption and cronyism. As a prominent leader in the A.N.C. he became notorious for his lavish lifestyle wearing Breitling watches and Louis Vuitton loafers driving a top-of-the-line Range Rover and building a house in one of Johannesburgs most luxurious suburbs.         He has been accused of bankrolling his luxury by steering millions of dollars in state contracts to himself and his allies and he is currently facing a charge of money laundering in connection with contracts with an engineering company linked to him in his home province Limpopo.         Mr. Malema has denied those accusations and in an interview said that his expulsion from the A.N.C. was a sign that the movement has become a pig and is eating its own children. He said that President Jacob Zuma had forced him out of the party because he felt threatened and wanted to appease white business leaders.         He removed me because people said to him Remove Malema and white people will be happyÂ  Mr. Malema said.         He has pitched himself as the man to finish South Africas incomplete revolution by transferring wealth from white men who control the vast majority of industry and much of the arable land to the black majority. He has excoriated the A.N.C.s black empowerment programs as a get-rich scheme for a chosen few and accuses the party of abandoning the poor.                Also in Video »       
239,100000002544094,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,,Conservative U.S. Catholics Feel Left Out of the Pope’s Embrace,LAURIE GOODSTEIN,1242,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/us/conservative-us-catholics-feel-left-out-of-the-popes-embrace.html,1,SMYRNA Ga.  When  Pope Francis  was elected in March Bridget Kurt received a small prayer card with his picture at her church and put it up on her refrigerator at home next to pictures of her friends and her favorite saints.         She is a regular attender of Mass a longtime stalwart in her churchs anti-abortion movement and a believer that all the churchs doctrines are true and beautiful and should be obeyed. She loved the last two popes and keeps a scrapbook with memorabilia from her road trip to Denver in 1993 to see Pope John Paul II at World Youth Day.         But Ms. Kurt recently took the Pope Francis prayer card down and threw it away.         It seems hes focusing on bringing back the left thats fallen away but what about the conservatives? said Ms. Kurt a hospice community educator. Even when it was discouraging working in pro-life you always felt like Mother Teresa was on your side and the popes were encouraging you. Now I feel kind of thrown under the bus.         In the eight months since he became pope Francis has won affection worldwide for his humble mien and common touch. His approval numbers are skyrocketing. Even atheists are applauding.         But not everyone is so enchanted. Some Catholics in the churchs conservative wing in the United States say Francis has left them feeling abandoned and deeply unsettled. On the Internet and in conversations among themselves they despair that after 35 years in which the previous popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI drew clear boundaries between right and wrong Francis is muddying Catholic doctrine to appeal to the broadest possible audience.         They were particularly alarmed when he told a prominent Italian atheist in an  interview published in October  and translated into English that everyone has his own idea of good and evil and that everyone should follow the good and fight evil as he conceives them  a remark that many conservatives interpreted as appearing to condone relativism. He called proselytizing solemn nonsense.         They were shocked when they saw that Francis said in the interview that the most serious of the evils today are youth unemployment and the loneliness of the old. It compounded the chagrin after he said  in an earlier interview  that he had intentionally not spoken much about abortion  same-sex marriage  or contraception because the church could not be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines.          Steve Skojec  the vice president of a real estate firm in Virginia and a blogger who has written for several conservative Catholic websites wrote of Francis statements: Are they explicitly heretical? No. Are they dangerously close? Absolutely. What kind of a Christian tells an atheist he has no intention to convert him? That alone should disturb Catholics everywhere.         In an interview on Friday Mr. Skojec said he was overwhelmed by the positive response to his blog from people who said they were thinking the same things but had not wanted to say them in public. He said he had come to suspect that Francis is a self-styled revolutionary who wants to change the church fundamentally.         There have been bad popes in the history of the church Mr. Skojec said. Popes that murdered popes that had mistresses. Im not saying Pope Francis is terrible but theres no divine protection that keeps him from being the type of guy who with subtlety undermines the teachings of the church to bring about a different vision.         Most American Catholics do not share Mr. Skojecs objections. A  poll released last month by Quinnipiac University  found that two in three agreed with Francis that the church was too obsessed with a few issues.         In parsing Francis statements in recent weeks other conservative Catholics are concluding that nothing he has said contradicts the Catholic catechism with some of his language even echoing Benedicts. But in interviews the words that conservatives used most often to characterize Francis were naÃ¯ve and imprudent. They believe that he is saying things in ways that the news media and the churchs enemies are able to distort and that there are consequences.         Some pointed to a vote on gay marriage just last week in Illinois. Two Catholic state legislators who voted to approve same-sex marriage there  cited the words of Pope Francis: Who am I to judge?  The pope said those words in response to a question about gay people during a long freewheeling interview on an airplane in July. But Francis has not changed Catholic teaching which holds that marriage is between only a man and a woman and that gay sex is wrong but gay people are worthy of mercy and respect.

240,100000002536315,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,,"For Riot Site in New Mexico, a Gift Shop but No Ghost Stories",FERNANDA SANTOS,952,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/us/for-riot-site-in-new-mexico-a-gift-shop-but-no-ghost-stories.html,22,SANTA FE N.M.  When it came time to organize the celebrations for New Mexicos centennial last year Gov. Susana Martinez turned to the members of her cabinet for suggestions. The  Corrections Department  secretary Gregg Marcantel a burly former Marine just months into the job was stumped. What could the states troubled prison system faced with a high rate of recidivism and drastic budget cuts possibly have to offer?         An unlikely answer it turned out lay in the departments darkest chapter behind the locked gates of the shuttered Penitentiary of New Mexico on the outskirts of this picturesque city where one of the nations deadliest prison riots broke out on Feb. 2 1980. In 36 hours 33 inmates were killed and more than 200 were injured  some dismembered others burned alive inside their cells. Fourteen corrections officers were held hostage and brutalized during the rampage.         The savagery  fueled by feuds that had long festered inside a prison built for 900 but housing 1100  raged unimpeded and led to fundamental  changes  to the way prisoners were classified housed and disciplined in the state. Opening the prison to visitors and telling the story of the riot Mr. Marcantel said was a way to preserve that history.         We thought lets open it up for tours Mr. Marcantel said from his office here where a state seal carved in wood by an inmate decorates one wall.         The tours initially scheduled for once a month were booked in a matter of days. When extra tours were added they were snapped up within hours.         Mr. Marcantel sensed an opportunity. As he began to plan ideas that seemed at once ambitious and risky also seemed plausible: meals cooked by inmates served to visitors in the mess hall haircuts in the prisons barbershop art like the carving hanging in his office sold at a gift shop.         The possibilities are limitless he said.         Critics were vehement. His office received calls from people asking if he had lost his mind he said or saying the place ought to be pulverized along with the memories it held.         During the riot dormitories were charred and flooded the control center was destroyed and the protective-custody cellblock where most of the killings occurred was permanently scarred by the violence; hatchet marks remain visible on its concrete floor.         Cathy Catamach a prison records clerk at the time remembered coming back to work after the riot to salvage what I could but not much was left. Much of the prison was repaired after the riot and it reopened several months later.         Gary Nelson 65 was serving time for armed robbery at the prison the night the riot broke out. We were just thrown in there violent and nonviolent inmates together; no one cared he said. People were amazed that level of brutality could happen inside a prison. The question they should ask themselves is what led to that?         Reopening Old Main as the penitentiary has been called since it closed in 1998 is in part about respecting our past to create a better future Mr. Marcantel said echoing words that have been painted above the prisons entryway close to the names of the inmates killed and the corrections officers terrorized during the riot.         It is also a way to give inmates at the state prison that opened next door a chance to learn business skills not often taught behind bars; they will be in charge of areas like sales and inventory at the gift shop and kitchen if one plan becomes reality.         When they leave theyre going to have to check a box when they go look for a job revealing their criminal past Mr. Marcantel said. And the way unemployment is chances are theyre not going to be given preference so this is about offering them alternatives.         On tours there is the acceptable like pointing out the outline of an inmates charred body by a cramped stairwell landing in the protective-custody wing and the unacceptable like recounting the ghost stories for which the prison has gained notoriety on television shows like  The Dead Files  on the Travel Channel or the graphic details found in books about the riot with titles like  The Devils Butcher Shop . (The prison is a well-used set for movies. Adam Sandlers remake of The Longest Yard was filmed inside Cellblock 2 and Osama bin Ladens Pakistani compound in Zero Dark Thirty was built on its grounds.)         Corrections officers double as tour guides showing visitors the undamaged chapel where some inmates stopped to pray during the mayhem; the infirmary raided for the drugs stored there; and a dormitory still unrepaired its white walls turned gray by smoke and fire.         Clocks frozen in time hang on the walls set at critical moments like the start of the riot (1:45 a.m.) and the destruction of the control center (2:02 a.m.).         Last years free tours part of the centennial festivities attracted about 5000 visitors. Last month as an experiment the Corrections Department started charging $10 and 577 people signed up said a spokeswoman Alex Tomlin. The money has been used to spruce up the place a job that included cleaning a visitor center courtyard which had become choked with trash and weeds.         On Oct. 25 Mr. Nelson joined some other riot survivors who were invited to a private tour of Old Main. For many inmates shipped to other states prisons after the violence it was their first return visit.         Reflecting on the tour days later from his home in Albuquerque Mr. Nelson said: The violence was so horrible there but in a sense seeing the prison did provide me a sense of relief. Its over you know? Im never going back in there again.                Also in Video »       
241,100000002535521,0,Article,News,World,world,asia,Elderly Woman’s Killing Lays Bare Myanmar’s Religious Divisions,THOMAS FULLER,1378,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/world/asia/elderly-womans-killing-lays-bare-myanmars-religious-divisions.html,10,THABYU CHAING Myanmar  Paralyzed from the waist down Daw Aye Kyi was too heavy for her daughter and granddaughter to carry into the surrounding jungle when a Buddhist mob stormed through this rice-farming village hunting for Muslims.         Three men brandishing machetes and knives ignored pleas for mercy and lunged at Ms. Aye Kyi. Her daughter and her granddaughter fled. Several hours later Ms. Aye Kyis body was discovered slumped next to the smoking cinders of her wooden house. The police say she was stabbed six times. She was 94 years old.         Ms. Aye Kyi was one of five Muslims killed in the attack on Thabyu Chaing last month a rampage that also destroyed more than a dozen homes. So far in a year and a half of sporadic Buddhist-Muslim violence more than 200 people mostly Muslims have died.         But the killing of a helpless elderly woman  and what followed  is one of the starkest symbols of the breadth of anti-Muslim feelings in this Buddhist-majority country the lack of sympathy for the victims and the failure of security forces to stop the killings.         The state-run news media obliquely reported the killings as casualties without offering any details. And although the president of the fledgling democracy ordered his office to directly investigate the deaths there has been no national outcry.         For a culture that has such great respect for the elderly the killing of this old lady should have been a turning point a moment of national soul searching said Richard Horsey a former United Nations official in the country. The fact that this has not happened is almost as disturbing as the killing itself.         The violence that swept through this village took with it the final vestiges of what had until very recently been a peaceful place where Muslims and Buddhists had coexisted amicably for generations before the loosening of the hard hand of the old junta freed some of Myanmars demons. The match that lit the violence here in Thabyu Chaing in the western state of Rakhine as elsewhere appeared to be the teachings of a radical Buddhist group 969 that the government continues to allow to preach hatred and extend its influence throughout the countryside.         Hatred for Muslims  partly because of colonial-era grievances  and the fear of appearing sympathetic to them run so deep in Myanmar that officials seem afraid even to console the victims families.         When the local police chief U Tin Maung Lwin inspected the body of Ms. Aye Kyi her daughter and granddaughter remember his saying How cruel. But in a telephone interview Mr. Tin Maung Lwin who like the vast majority of government employees is Buddhist denied using cruel to describe the murder.         I did not use words that favor one side or the other he said.         After five decades of military rule Myanmar remains a heavily militarized country where the army alone numbers around half a million men and where plainclothes intelligence officers are ubiquitous. Yet security forces were unwilling or unable to stop the Buddhist mob here.         Muslim villagers say the authorities were well aware of the danger because they received a telephone call from the local police station on Sept. 30 the day before the violence warning them of looming danger and instructing them to erect a gate at the entrance to the village.         In the early hours of Oct. 1 when villagers received reports that a mob of several dozen men was approaching they made urgent phone calls to the police and military units a few miles away.         U Myint Aung a Muslim farmer says the security forces responded with skepticism. They asked us Are you sure? Are you sure?Â  he said.         We told them Yes we are sure. Come quickly!Â          A single police vehicle arrived and dispersed a first wave of attackers before dawn. But the mob that killed Ms. Aye Kyi returned midmorning and the police fled after firing into the air villagers say.         Lt. Col. Kyaw Tint a senior police officer in Rakhine State said security forces did their best.         Wai Moe contributed reporting from Yangon Myanmar.        Also in Video »       
242,100000002513638,0,Article,News,World,world,europe,"Aided by Army of ‘Vapers,’ E-Cigarette Industry Woos and Wins Europe",ANDREW HIGGINS,1461,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/world/europe/aided-by-army-of-vapers-e-cigarette-industry-woos-and-wins-europe.html,6,BRUSSELS  Facing a decision on whether to impose tight restrictions on a booming market for electronic cigarettes members of the European Parliament received a pleading letter in September that was signed by thousands of former smokers worried that the positive story of e-cigarettes may be about to come to an abrupt halt.         The signatures had been collected via a website  saveecigs.com  which proclaimed itself the voice of the forgotten millions in this debate  people who had taken up e-cigarettes to stop smoking and their grateful families.         The website however was not quite the grass-roots effort it claimed to be. The text of the letter it asked people to sign was drafted by a London lobbyist hired by Totally Wicked an e-cigarette company. The website had been set up by a British woman living in Iceland who had previously worked for the owners of Totally Wicked.         As the headquarters of the European Union Brussels sets regulatory standards that resonate around the world. It rivals Washington as a focus for corporate lobbying with an estimated 30000 professional lobbyists with registered lobbying firms and thousands more who operate beneath the radar.         In this case a determined lobbying campaign marrying corporate interests in a fledgling but fast-growing industry with voices elicited from the general public was aimed at a compelling public health issue: whether e-cigarettes which deliver nicotine without burning tobacco should be regulated as medicinal products just as nicotine patches are.         The stakes were substantial. Although e-cigarettes have not been linked to any serious health issues they have been in widespread use for such a short time that researchers have no basis yet for determining if there are long-term risks. The decision by the European Union would set the stage for a debate over the extent of regulation in the United States where the Food and Drug Administration is soon expected to issue its own rules on nicotine-delivery devices. The outcome of the battle in Brussels could go a long way in shaping the competitive landscape of the business in Europe and beyond.         The odds seemed very much against the e-cigarette industry. Hostility toward corporate lobbying runs deep in the European Union bureaucracy and legislature. And lawmakers were seemingly on track to categorize e-cigarettes as medicinal.         Yet the outcome driven in large part by the industrys success in mobilizing a wave of support from consumers and using it to apply political pressure to lawmakers amounted to a big victory for e-cigarette sellers one in which they outgunned not just the tobacco companies but also pharmaceutical companies that make competing products for people trying to stop smoking.         To the delight of companies like Totally Wicked the European Parliament voted Oct. 8 to scrap proposals by health officials to regulate e-cigarettes as a medicinal product which would have restricted their sale to pharmacies in many countries of the 28-nation bloc and imposed costly certification procedures on producers. The Parliaments decision did not end the argument but it lifted a big immediate cloud threatening a business that some Wall Street analysts predict could be bigger than tobacco within a decade.         When the European Commission initially proposed last December that e-cigarettes be treated like medicines the industry immediately realized that we had a very big problem and a big fight ahead recalled Ray Story the American president of United Tobacco Vapor Group an e-cigarette company with offices in Atlanta and Amsterdam.         Determined to avoid a precedent that would most likely harden the regulation of e-cigarettes far beyond Europe Mr. Story hired EPPA an established Brussels lobbying company and a prominent Belgian law firm Van Bael & Bellis. They pressed the argument that e-cigarettes are not a drug and that any decision to classify them as such would be vigorously challenged in court.                Also in T Magazine »

He opened it once to make sure moths had not eaten through it. This year Mazeroski decided to sell it and other memorabilia.         On Saturday the uniform sold for $632500 through Hunt Auctions at the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory in Kentucky.         The figure is nearly as much as the $657250 that Mike Eruzione the captain of the 1980 United States Olympic hockey team recently received for the uniform he wore during the Miracle on Ice defeat of the Soviet Union.         Still those figures are a fraction of the $4.4 million that was paid last year for a gray wool road jersey that Babe Ruth wore in 1920 his first season with the Yankees.         Mazeroskis collection sold for $1.7 million in all including $322000 for the cleats he wore in Game 7 of the 1960 Series and $97750 for the bat he used to hit the winning home run.

244,100000002544060,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,politics,Obama’s Portable Zone of Secrecy (Some Assembly Required),MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT;ERIC SCHMITT,1271,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/us/politics/obamas-portable-zone-of-secrecy-some-assembly-required.html,1,WASHINGTON  When  President Obama  travels abroad his staff packs briefing books gifts for foreign leaders and something more closely associated with camping than diplomacy: a tent.         Even when Mr. Obama travels to allied nations aides quickly set up the security tent  which has opaque sides and noise-making devices inside  in a room near his hotel suite. When the president needs to read a classified document or have a sensitive conversation he ducks into the tent to shield himself from secret video cameras and listening devices.         American security officials demand that their bosses  not just the president but members of Congress diplomats policy makers and military officers  take such precautions when traveling abroad because it is widely acknowledged that their hosts often have no qualms about snooping on their guests.         The United States has come under withering criticism in recent weeks about revelations that the  National Security Agency  listened in on allied leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. A panel created by Mr. Obama in August to review that practice among other things is scheduled to submit a preliminary report this week and a final report by the middle of next month. But American officials assume  and can cite evidence  that they get the same treatment when they travel abroad even from European Union allies.         No matter where you are we are a target these days said R. James Woolsey Jr. the director of central intelligence during the Clinton administration. No matter where we go countries like China Russia and much of the Arab world have assets and are trying to spy on us so you have to think about that and take as many precautions as possible.         On a trip to Latin America in 2011 for example a White House photo showed Mr. Obama talking from a security tent in a Rio de Janeiro hotel suite with Hillary Rodham Clinton then the secretary of state and Robert M. Gates the defense secretary at the time about the air war against Libya that had been launched the previous day. Another photo taken three days later in San Salvador showed him conferring from the tent with advisers about the attack.         Spokesmen for the State Department the C.I.A. and the National Security Council declined to provide details on the measures the government takes to protect officials overseas. But more than a dozen current and former government officials most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity described in interviews some of those measures.         They range from instructing officials traveling overseas to assume every utterance and move is under surveillance and requiring them to scrub their cellphones for listening devices after they have visited government offices to equipping the presidents limousine which always travels with him to keep private conversations private. Mr. Obama carries a specially encrypted BlackBerry; one member of his cabinet was told he could not take his iPad on an overseas trip because it was not considered a secure device.         Countermeasures are taken on American soil as well. When cabinet secretaries and top national security officials take up their new jobs the government retrofits their homes with special secure rooms for top-secret conversations and computer use.         In accordance with a several-hundred-page classified manual the rooms are lined with foil and soundproofed. An interior location preferably with no windows is recommended. One of the most recent recipients: James B. Comey the new director of the F.B.I. whose homes in the Washington area and New England were retrofitted.         During the Cold War a former senior official said listening devices were found embedded in the walls and light fixtures of the hotels where American diplomats stayed. These days the official said American analysts worry more about eavesdropping radio signals beamed toward hotel rooms in the hopes of picking up officials conversations.         We took it for granted that in some of these hotels no matter the state that devices were built in there the official said.

Would the league be able to keep itself afloat financially? And would enough elite players participate to make it a success?         The league is now coming to the close of its ninth season and the questions have been answered. The league has 16 teams with rosters full of both established and up-and-coming players.         Much of the credit lies with  Gregory Shahade  an international master who founded the league and is still its president. Shahade who is also a poker player recruited  PokerStars.com  as a sponsor and its commitment has continued.         The chess leagues regular season which started in late August ended recently. The league names a most valuable player for the regular season. This year it was  Jeffrey Xiong  a strong master from Texas who was born in 2000 and who played this season for the  Dallas Destiny . He won all of his games including matches against three grandmasters.         His victory in a league match on Oct. 22 against  Doug Eckert  a master who plays for the  St. Louis Arch Bishops  was impressive because Xiong demonstrated a maturity in his decision-making that allowed him to dominate each phase of the game.         The opening was the Reti named after Richard Reti a great player of the early 20th century who was born in what is now Slovakia.         Xiongs 3 ... c5 was not unusual. The idea was to let White take the pawn if he wanted so that Black could then play his knight to c6 without having it be harassed by White moving a pawn to b5.         Eckert offered a pawn sacrifice with 5 a3 to speed up his development. Rather than help him do that by playing 5 ... ba3 which would have allowed 6 Ba3 Xiong played 5 ... b3 to slow down Eckerts development.         Xiong chose 13 ... f5 with the idea that he would sacrifice an exchange but win a pawn for it. The sequence of moves that followed helped Xiong speed up his development and take control of the center. The plan was effective and after 21 ... e4 Eckert was running out of useful moves.         So he returned the exchange after 22 Qd2 Nb3 23 Qb2 Na1. But Xiong held on to his extra pawn.         Eckert was able to win back that pawn but at the cost of allowing a series of exchanges that led to an endgame where Xiong had a clear edge because he could create a passed pawn on the queenside.         That advantage quickly proved decisive. Eckert resigned after 45 ... Bc5 because the king and pawn endgame would have been hopeless after 46 Kc2 Bd4 47 Bd4 Kd4.        
246,100000002544204,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,,Hawaii Nears Approval of Gay Marriage,ERIK ECKHOLM,439,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/us/hawaii-nears-approval-of-gay-marriage.html,24,HONOLULU  The State House of Representatives passed a bill late Friday to legalize  same-sex marriage  all but ensuring that Hawaii will soon join 15 other states and the District of Columbia in allowing gay couples to wed.         After 12 hours of heated debate the House approved the measure on a 30-to-19 vote. The bill will now be sent to the State Senate which approved same-sex marriage by a wide margin but must accept revisions in the House version for the measure to become law.         Gov. Neil Abercrombie a Democrat who called a special session of the Legislature to address the issue praised the House action and indicated that he would quickly sign the legislation when it reached him. I look forward to a successful conclusion to this major step in affirming everyones civil rights Mr. Abercrombie said in a statement issued late Friday night.         As members of the largely Democratic House debated they could hear opponents outside chanting Let the people decide.         Inside the chamber opponents said the measure would infringe on religious freedom and endanger Hawaiian culture. But a leading supporter of the bill State Representative Chris Lee expressed the prevailing view saying In Hawaii we are all minorities and we all deserve the same dignity and respect.         The likely expansion of marriage rights in Hawaii follows 20 years of conflict here over the issue with religious conservatives leading the opposition. In 1993 the Hawaii Supreme Court issued the nations first decision that said refusing to allow gay men and lesbians to marry was illegal discrimination.         That ruling at a time when same-sex marriage was not legal anywhere inspired civil rights advocates across the country to make it a priority in politics and the courts.         But it also prompted a backlash. Voters here passed an amendment to the Hawaii Constitution in 1998 that gave the Legislature the power to override the courts and limit marriage to a man and a woman.         Opponents of same-sex marriage vowed last week to challenge the expected new law in court arguing that voters in 1998 intended to ban such marriages. But the state attorney general David M. Louie said that under the terms of the amendment the Legislature clearly retained the authority to decide the issue.         The House measure broadened the religious protections beyond those adopted by the Senate. It said not only that pastors and churches could refuse to perform same-sex weddings but also that church-affiliated facilities and nonprofit groups could decline to provide goods and services for such celebrations.         But the bill did not authorize small-business owners like caterers florists and photographers to discriminate against gay and lesbian couples.                Also in Video »       
247,100000002433637,0,Article,News,World,world,asia,"New China Cities: Shoddy Homes, Broken Hope",IAN JOHNSON,2453,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/world/asia/new-china-cities-shoddy-homes-broken-hope.html,1,HUAMING China  Three years ago the Shanghai World Expo featured this newly built town as a model for how China would move from being a land of farms to a land of cities. In a dazzling pavilion visited by more than a million people visitors learned how farmers were being given a new life through a fair-and-square deal that did not cost them anything.         Today Huaming may be an example of another transformation: the ghettoization of Chinas new towns.         Signs of social dysfunction abound. Young people who while away their days in Internet cafes or pool halls say that only a small fraction of them have jobs. The elderly are forced to take menial work to make ends meet. Neighborhood and family structures have been damaged.         Most worrying are the suicides which local residents say have become an all-too-familiar sign of despair.         As China pushes ahead with government-led urbanization a program expected to be endorsed at a Communist Party Central Committee meeting that began Saturday many worry that the scores of new housing developments here may face the same plight as postwar housing projects in Western countries. Meant to solve one problem they may be creating a new set of troubles that could plague Chinese cities for generations.         Were talking hundreds of millions of people who are moving into these places but the standard of living for these relocatees has actually dropped said Lynette Ong a University of Toronto political scientist who has studied the resettlement areas. On top of that is the quality of the buildings  there was a lot of corruption and they skimped on materials.         Huaming is far from being a dangerous slum. It has no gangs drug use or street violence. Nearly half the town is given over to green space. Trees line the streets that lead to elementary middle and high schools.         But the new homes have cracked walls leaking windows and elevators with rusted out floors. For farmers who were asked to surrender their ancestral lands for an apartment the deterioration adds to a sense of having been cheated.         That was their land said Wei Ying a 35-year-old unemployed woman whose parents live in a poorly built unit. You have to understand how they feel in their heart.         The sense of despair and alienation surfaces in the suicides a late-night leap from a balcony drinking of pesticide or lying down on railroad tracks.         I have anxiety attacks because we have no income no job nothing said Feng Aiju 40 a former farmer who moved to Huaming in 2008 against her will. She said she had spent a small fortune by local standards $1500 on antidepressants. We never had a chance to speak; we were never asked anything. I want to go home.         The situation in these new towns contrasts with the makeshift housing where other migrants live. Many of those are created by farmers who chose to leave their land for jobs in the city. Although cramped and messy they are full of vitality and upward mobility said Biao Xiang a social anthropologist at Oxford University who has studied migrant communities.         These migrant neighborhoods in big cities are often called slums but its the new resettlement communities that will be harder to revive partly because they are not related to any productive economic activity Professor Xiang said. And the population tend to be homogeneous disadvantaged communities.          Addressing Disorder   The idea behind Huaming was radically different. In 2005 Huaming Township was chosen to be a demonstration for successful planned urbanization. A township is an administrative unit in China above a village but below a county and Huaming had 41000 people living in 12 small villages dotted across 60 square miles most of which was farmland.         For northern China it was unusually fertile because water was plentiful. On the outskirts of one of Chinas largest cities the port of Tianjin it was well known for its local handicrafts such as decorative paper-cutting and especially its vegetables that were easily sold in the big city.         City planners however saw it as a major problem.         Sue-Lin Wong contributed reporting. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 17 2013 An article last Sunday about the failure of many of Chinas newly built towns and cities to live up to the governments promises referred incorrectly to a social anthropologist and professor at Oxford University Biao Xiang who commented that one drawback of the new communities is their lack of relationship to any productive economic activity.

248,100000002544231,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,New York City Asks Court to Vacate Rulings on Stop-and-Frisk Tactic,BENJAMIN WEISER;JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN,775,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/nyregion/city-asks-court-to-vacate-rulings-on-policing-tactic.html,31,The  Bloomberg administration  in its most aggressive push yet to erase the stain of a judges rulings on police  stop-and-frisk  practices asked a federal appeals court on Saturday to vacate her decisions which had ordered sweeping changes including the appointment of a monitor.         The decisions by Judge  Shira A. Scheindlin  of Federal District Court in Manhattan had already been halted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit while it considered the citys appeal. But if Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio as he has promised withdraws the appeal the court-ordered reforms would most likely go into effect.         The citys filing which came shortly after midnight seemed aimed in part at ensuring that Judge Scheindlins rulings disappeared before Mr. Bloomberg leaves office and did not detract from his legacy. But if the Second Circuit rules in favor of the city there would be a more immediate ramification: Mr. de Blasio a Democrat could take office without a Police Department under court supervision.         Mr. de Blasio was asked on Friday night while in San Juan P.R. attending a conference of Hispanic lawmakers about the attempt to vacate Judge Scheindlins order which the city said last week it would seek to do.         Ive said from the beginning Mr. de Blasio said if the Bloomberg administration had paid attention to the concerns of communities all over New York City and had paid attention to Judge Scheindlins concerns we would have had action a year or two ago and there never would have been a court order and there never would have been a monitor.         Well see what happens over these next seven or eight weeks he said adding that he looked forward to working with the monitor.         An aide to Mr. de Blasio said on Saturday that the Bloomberg administration had neither consulted the mayor-elect on the citys move to vacate Judge Scheindlins decisions nor did Mr. de Blasio support such an effort. A Law Department spokeswoman also said that the city had not coordinated its legal strategy with Mr. de Blasio or his staff.         In the filing on Saturday Michael A. Cardozo the corporation counsel said that Judge Scheindlins decisions continue unfairly and improperly to cloud the publics perception of the N.Y.P.D.         The district courts orders lend credence to the notion that the N.Y.P.D. unfairly targets minorities for stops and frisks Mr. Cardozo wrote undermining its ability to carry out its mission effectively.         He also made reference to Judge Scheindlins findings that in stopping and frisking people the department had violated the Constitution and resorted to a policy of indirect racial profiling.         Wrongly labeling the N.Y.P.D.  and the City  a racial profiling entity and flouter of the Fourth Amendment should be sufficient injustice to vacate the Orders Mr. Cardozo wrote.         Burt Neuborne the lawyer who has filed papers seeking to present a defense of Judge Scheindlin before the appeals court said: I never thought I would see the corporation counsel of the City of New York stoop to such tactics. Its judicial McCarthyism. And for what? Because the N.Y.P.D.s feelings are hurt? Thats the only reason the city gives for this extraordinary attack on the judge.         In staying Judge Scheindlins rulings last month a three-judge panel criticized her saying she ran afoul of the judicial code of conduct and compromised the appearance of impartiality by appearing to steer the stop-and-frisk case to herself in 2007 and granting interviews this year to news organizations while a decision was still pending.         It also removed her from continuing to supervise the case which has been given to a new judge.         Mr. Cardozo also argued that Judge Scheindlins role in steering the litigation to her courtroom in the first place clouded everything that followed.         The very nature of the judicial misconduct he wrote has necessarily created a situation where the District Courts impartiality throughout the litigation might reasonably be questioned at a minimum.         In January 2008 the plaintiffs at Judge Scheindlins suggestion had marked the lawsuit known as Floyd v. City of New York as related to an earlier stop-and-frisk lawsuit that Judge Scheindlin had presided over since 1999. That meant that the lawsuit bypassed the random case assignment process that governs which judge hears which case.         Judge Scheindlin has defended this suggesting that it made procedural sense. But in its ruling on Oct. 31 the appellate panel found that Judge Scheindlin improperly applied the related-case rule.         In the citys filing Mr. Cardozo wrote that Judge Scheindlins role in landing the case implicates more than a mere error interpreting court rules.         The effect of this misconduct derogated the very appearance of justice from the outset Mr. Cardozo wrote.

249,100000002544079,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,football,Civility Need Not Be Excluded From the Culture of the N.F.L.,WILLIAM C. RHODEN,892,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/sports/football/civility-need-not-be-excluded-from-the-culture-of-the-nfl.html,4,As the situation with the Miami Dolphins was escalating Calvin Hill recalled the rigors of his N.F.L. rookie-hood and not with particular fondness.         Hill was a star running back at Yale and a first-round pick in the N.F.L. when he was selected by Dallas in the 1969 draft.         His first test came when the Cowboys rookies played an Oakland team that had first- second- and a few third-year players. The Cowboys were trying Hill at linebacker and tight end where they had him against Oakland. The linebacker playing over his head was Chip Oliver a second-year player who was giving Hill a tough time.         I was confused Hill said Thursday in a telephone interview. Theyd been moving me all around and I really didnt have a clue. I couldnt get off the line of scrimmage. Finally I got frustrated.         After the third or fourth play Hills survival instincts took over. He hit Oliver with a hard shot below the belt. The two fought but Oliver got the message. Later that season Hill ran into Al Davis the Raiders owner who had watched Hill hit Oliver.         Al told me that when he saw me do that he knew I could play in the N.F.L. Hill said.         Hills more immediate challenge was negotiating the Cowboys veteran locker room as a rookie. One veteran in particular had it out for Hill.         The player stayed on my case Hill said. The player a defensive lineman made Hill run errands including getting ice and fetching pizza.         One evening at a party at a teammates home the defensive lineman started in on Hill and Hill got in his face.         I basically just told him where to go Hill said clearly offering a sanitized version of the incident. They had to be separated but the hazing stopped. I always get the sense that I sort of earned his respect by standing up to him.         In the unfolding case of the Dolphins Jonathan Martin who has accused his offensive line teammate Richie Incognito of bullying many say that Martin should have done to Incognito what Hill did to that defensive lineman more than 40 years ago: confront his tormentor and put an end to the harassment. Instead Martin left the team this month and Incognito was suspended.         Players are larger equipment is better and rule changes have aimed to make football safer. But the essence of the game  on the field and in the locker room  has not changed drastically from when Hill was a rookie.         And thats the problem. Indeed the underlying tension between Martin and Incognito shows that the locker room culture needs to change. We keep hearing how football is different that somehow the physical nature of the game excuses boorish behavior. Thats nonsense.         If the sport brings out the worst in human beings then let us get rid of the sport.         Athletes have difficulty solving problems by using language said Hill who works as a consultant for the Cowboys. We problem-solve with our fists. We wont talk it out.         Hill speculated that Martin is a new breed of football player or simply a different type. Martins rearing and his education dictated that conflicts be solved through talk and mediation. That is not the N.F.L. way. In the N.F.L. locker room its all about action Hill said.         I asked Hill if he thought Martin should have physically confronted Incognito.         On most teams he said a rookie is going to go through a ritual. And at some point a guy may say Hey Im not doing this. It depends on who he is. You dont let anybody back you down. The guy is 320 pounds. Youd think that a 320-pound guy in a game like football would at some point say Enough is enough.Â          In a  recent column  for FoxSports.com Coy Wire who played at Stanford quoted a college teammate and longtime N.F.L. veteran who said Sometimes in a gladiator sport like football intelligence can be perceived as being soft.         Martin attended  Harvard-Westlake School  near Los Angeles then went to Stanford. Several generations of his family attended Harvard.         One undercurrent of the Incognito-Martin story is the idea that N.F.L. players especially African-Americans who attend elite schools or grow up in affluent neighborhoods are not as tough as players who grow up with fewer advantages. At least one of Martins black teammates went to ridiculous lengths referring to Incognito as an honorary brother. Trust me if the roles were reversed and Incognito were black and Martin white the narrative would be different.         The vexing issue raised by professional football and crystallized by Incognito and Martin is: Whom do you want defending your quarterback a bully or a pacifist? Must it be either-or? With so much money on the line winning becomes paramount and talent repeatedly trumps character.         Aaron Hernandez flourished in college and in the N.F.L. despite gaping character flaws because he had enormous talent. Privately some N.F.L. executives said that given a choice between Incognito and Martin they would take Incognito.         The mighty N.F.L. keeps springing leaks. In his zeal to make the league seem safer with fines rule changes and more fines Commissioner  Roger Goodell  overlooked the one element that may very well accelerate the erosion of his sport. It is not the violence players inflict on one another but the civility they withhold.

250,100000002543255,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,How I Helped Teachers Cheat,DAVE TOMAR,881,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/how-i-helped-teachers-cheat.html,9,FROM 2001 to 2010 I worked as an academic ghostwriter helping students cheat in college and grad school. Inevitably over a decade there were a few unsatisfied customers.          Once I completed an assignment for a student in a teaching course. The objective was to create a single-unit lesson plan that could be implemented in a classroom of fourth-grade science students. I did my best considering the last science class I attended probably involved a LaserDisc showing of The Manhattan Project.         Anyway the customer did not care for my work at all. He requested a revision noting that I have reviewed the paper and I believe that it is poorly written. The professor will quickly see through the excessive wording that I have no idea what Im talking about ... Even though this is at the masters level it does not have to consist of unnecessary use of wording.         Clearly this guy was going to make a great teacher.         During those years I learned a lot about what you needed to know to be a teacher. I wrote lesson plans and developed I.E.P.s  Individualized Education Programs  for imaginary students. I even wrote up classroom observations  for classes Id never been in of course. In return I was paid by would-be educators developing teachers and even aspiring principals.         So you can imagine my complete lack of surprise every time a newspaper headline reports another teacher cheating scandal.         Teachers are under intense pressure to make sure their students pass state proficiency tests. It turns out that one of the best ways to help otherwise deficient students pass these tests is to erase their incorrect answers and replace them with the right ones. Episodes of this wrong-to-right mode of cheating have been well publicized in cities like Washington Los Angeles and Atlanta. In the last case nearly 200 educators from more than 40 schools took part in systematic cheating. According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution some teachers actually gathered together on the weekends for pizza and eraser parties.         (For teachers who are simply too ethical to cheat there are other options. In 2004 it was revealed that more than 500 students in a Birmingham Ala. high school had been urged by teachers or principals to drop out of school before the test for fear they would bring the schools scores down. So thats one way to go.)         Where do teachers learn this kind of behavior? Well like everybody else teachers start out as students. In a recent survey by the Josephson Institute Center for Youth Ethics roughly 74 percent of students admitted that theyd copied another students work and 51 percent said theyd cheated on a test in the past year. Students cheat because so much is at stake: good grades good college good pay a good future. Teachers do it for the same reason: Their jobs their mortgages and the well-being of their families are all on the line.         I live in Philadelphia where the school system borders on a post-apocalyptic Blade Runner-like reality of violence blight and decay. I have a friend who works as a public school teacher here. She tells me the students have named some of the larger and more charming cockroaches with whom they share classroom space. This year after a budget shortfall of $304 million forced the school district to cut nursing staff by some 40 percent a 12-year-old girl  died  of an asthma attack.         To say that Philadelphias students arent getting what they need is an offensive understatement. But blaming teachers for the fact that students perform poorly under these conditions is like blaming the weatherman for an umbrella shortage.         In 2010 and 2011 Philadelphia had its own wrong-to-right teacher cheating scandal. What happened when the school districts cracked down? The most notable effect was a terrific drop in scores in one case by as much as 70 percent.         Using standardized tests to make evaluations is fine. But we are using them as a replacement for real education to prod educators toward unrealistic goals and to punish and reward: These are the conditions that make cheating a pragmatic solution for so many. We cant stop cheating but we can do a lot to reduce its incentives. We need to return to a focus on the enrichment and creativity that make learning as well as teaching worthwhile.         Until then well have more students cheating their way to college and more teachers helping them do it. Then when these students show up at their various universities and realize no one is going to fudge the answers for them theyll have to fudge those answers themselves. Some of these struggling students even aspire to become teachers (why I havent the foggiest). And thats when they call up someone like me.         Indeed somehow or another all of my former ghostwriting customers found their way into college and some into professional education programs. The following is a revision request I once received from a customer taking a course in educational leadership: Thank you for help me to complete my paper. Could I request to rewrite it because my teacher asked me to rewrite and show some mistakes in term grammar and cohesion in contain.         That guy is somebodys teacher now. If you can live with that dont change a thing.         Dave Tomar is the author of The Shadow Scholar: How I Made a Living Helping College Kids Cheat.        Also in T Magazine »       
251,100000002543395,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,Dear Governor Christie,ROSS DOUTHAT,833,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/douthat-dear-governor-christie.html,12,I KNOW governor I know: Its still too early for presidential speculation youre just focused on the job at hand and any talk of 2016 while flattering is purely hypothetical.         But just in case you do have some faint slight extremely modest interest in parlaying your landslide re-election into a presidential bid here are four 2016 donts to keep in mind:          Dont be Jon Huntsman.  This sounds easy enough but obvious pitfalls are still worth pointing out. For the next two years youre going to be hailed up and down the Acela Corridor as the Great Moderate Hope the anti-Tea Party candidate the Man Who Is Not Ted Cruz. But you cant actively embrace that part or give off the impression  as Huntsman did obviously and fatally  that you agree with the media that your partys full of rubes and cranks.         As a would-be nominee you have to woo base voters not run against them and make them feel respected even when they disagree with you. This doesnt mean muzzling yourself or pandering to every right-wing interest group. But it means persuading conservatives that you like them that you understand them and that as president youre going to be (mostly) on their side.          Dont be Rudy Giuliani.  You probably think you wouldnt have Rudys problems in a Republican primary. Yes youre both combative Northeasterners from the partys moderate flank but unlike the former mayor you arent a social liberal with a public history of adultery (and a few drag performances thrown in).         But what felled Giuliani in 2008 wasnt just values issues. It was the former mayors apparent belief that being a national hero was a sufficient qualification to be president  that he could just show up be Rudy and the rest would take care of itself.         As another charismatic politician defined by your handling of a catastrophe youre vulnerable to the same temptation: the belief that you personally are the solution to the Republican Partys many problems and that you can just run on your own awesomeness without specifying where you would take the country if you won. That act wears thin in a long campaign and its likely to wear especially thin in a party that needs a new agenda as badly as Republicans do today. Which brings us to ...          Dont assume that what worked in Jersey will work nationally.  In state-of-the-party arguments you and your fellow Republican governors love to contrast your successes with the national partys struggles. But those successes have been made possible by crucial differences between state-level issues and national ones.         In New Jersey for instance youve been able to successfully isolate public-sector unions portraying them as drains on middle-class tax dollars and enemies of the common good. But in national budget debates the biggest issues are popular entitlement programs not teacher salaries or bureaucrats health benefits. And you probably arent going to win the presidency wagging your finger at Social Security recipients or painting the poor and elderly as dangerous special-interest groups. You need a different way to convince voters that youre on the middle classs side and you wont find it unless you ...          Dont always listen to your donors.  As a standard-bearer for pragmatic non-apocalyptic Republicanism who also hails from a state where lots of rich Wall Streeters sleep at night youre going to be awash in money and with it will come lots of unsolicited advice. Some will be good: the Republican donor class has a better handle on certain political realities than the Tea Party. But some will be terrible because the rights donors are loath to acknowledge that their partys biggest problem isnt gay marriage or immigration or even the disastrous government shutdown. Its a brand identity cemented by Mitt Romneys persona and 47 percent remark as the handmaiden of Big Business and the rich.         To alter that identity youll need substance as well as regular-guy style: a tax plan that doesnt play just as a giveaway to the 1 percent a health care plan that isnt just a defense of the pre-Obamacare status quo an approach to spending that targets corporate welfare as well as food stamps.         The good news is that you already have populist politicians like Utahs Senator Mike Lee  leading the charge  into this territory so you can follow without worrying too much about being attacked as a RINO sellout squish. The bad news is that youll have a lot of big bundlers cornering you to explain that actually its much more important to cut capital-gains taxes or preserve the carried-interest loophole for hedge funds and why cant you move to the center on social issues and stick with upper-bracket tax cuts because after all they worked in the Reagan era ...         Which they did  in a completely different economic and political landscape. So if you want to have an era of your own youll need to nod politely crush your well-heeled advice-giver with a handshake and then take a different path.

252,100000002543345,0,Article,Editorial,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,"The Other Paris, Beyond the Boulevards",MIRA KAMDAR,923,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/the-other-paris-beyond-the-boulevards.html,10,PANTIN France  I live just outside Paris beyond the PÃ©riphÃ©rique the eternally clogged ring road that separates the City of Light from its suburban areas of darkness. My neighborhood is in Pantin where the infamous northeastern suburbs  the banlieues  begin. When I told one Parisian where I lived during casual chatter at a dinner party in the chic Marais quarter he actually stepped away from me and blurted: Quelle horreur! But it isnt a horrible place. And its where for better or worse a new France is being forged.         On the noisy sidewalks of the boulevard near my apartment there are no Hemingway-besotted expats in search of their own Midnight in Paris. My local farmers market does not sell kale the latest trendy American import and the bakery on the corner features round flat loaves of sesame-studded bread for a largely North African clientele.         My neighbors come from around the world; legal or illegal immigrants from Africa South Asia China and Vietnam. Most of the white faces I see are Poles Ukrainians Russians and Serbs. While I cant buy a good baguette expertly cut meat from known parentage or high-quality aged French cheeses right outside my door I can get preserved lemons bulk-priced spices basmati rice and the most amazing lemongrass-infused Thai sausages I have ever tasted.         I travel mostly by metro shuttling back and forth between my home and Paname as Paris is known here in the suburbs  an old nickname taken from the Panama hats worn by 19th-century fashionistas. I ride the No. 5 which runs north-south and stops at the Gare du Nord at once the transit point for the Eurostar to London and the gateway to the graffiti-scrawled suburban trains that ferry black and brown residents of the far-flung suburbs in and out of Paris. When I ride home in the evening many of the whites get off at RÃ©publique the heart of Pariss newly hip eastern quarters. I find myself then in a car where many languages are spoken rarely French and where one never hears the twangy tones of excited American tourists.         Ive learned a lot during my long commutes on the metro. One thing is not to underestimate the cosmopolitanism of my fellow travelers. I found myself sitting once next to a young French-African woman. I was stunned when her phone rang and she answered in serviceable Hindi. When she finished I couldnt help asking her how it was that she spoke the language. Oh she explained she belonged to an evangelical church and had learned Hindi in Paris to spread the good word among Indian immigrants. I knew evangelical Protestantism was flourishing in immigrant communities in France but this cross-cultural example floored me.         When I emerge from the storied metro stations of Saint-Germain-des-PrÃ©s Louvre or Saint-Paul I am always blown away by the beauty of old Paris with its limestone buildings its grand boulevards and its elegant cafes where a garÃ§on with a starched white tea towel over his arm will call you Madame. I try not to see the Starbucks and the McDonalds that have invaded this capital of fine dining and I often buy a loaf of good bread and some very expensive cheese to carry home.         Some day soon I may not have to travel into Paris to buy these things. My neighborhood is changing. The canal that snakes up from the Seine in eastern Paris has long been gentrified up to the Parc de la Villette a modern swath of green on Pariss northern border. Work is in full swing to rehabilitate the seedy banks of the canal beyond. The old mills in Pantin have been transformed into offices for the banking giant BNP. Further north Chanel has installed its headquarters. HermÃ¨s has bought up whole blocks for its ateliers. New apartment buildings are going up with spaces reserved for affordable housing but also for canalside cafes. Just down the road from the Tang FrÃ¨res Chinese supermarket Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac has opened a new space in an old warehouse where members of the international art scene view works by Anselm Kiefer and Joseph Beuys.         From every side of my apartment I see cranes. Construction is booming. The new tramway that will one day circle all around Paris stops downstairs. In a nod to gender balance many of the new tram stops are named after women. My stop is Delphine Seyrig. The next stop is Ella Fitzgerald.         Pantin is proud of its working-class heritage. It is home to a green school which produces more energy than it consumes. It hosts a collective that delivers local produce by barge several times a week along the canal. It sponsors a jazz festival and a film festival. It is building a new market square repaving streets and cleaning up its parks. The neighborhood is not immune to signs of the widening gap between the ideals of the secular French social-welfare state and an increasingly diverse population. Small Muslim girls wearing head scarves trail behind their fully covered mothers. Young black men with nothing better to do smoke in front of the public housing entrance. An illegal immigrant from Pakistan sells fruit from a crate on the sidewalk. But there are also boisterous girls in skinny jeans tousled hair tangling in the wind a girl from Algeria arm-in-arm with one from Senegal.         I dont feel despair or fear here but something more alive than the static elegance of eternal Paris. The future of this great city is on its periphery.

253,100000002543489,0,Article,Editorial,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,Still Dangerous,THE EDITORIAL BOARD,560,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/still-dangerous.html,10,Five years ago when the economy imploded the world learned that the global financial system was in part a casino built on derivatives complex instruments that are supposed to reduce risk but are instead widely used by banks and other big investors for speculation. Since then new rules have been created to rein in derivatives through transparency oversight and competition. Issued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the agency empowered by the Dodd-Frank reform law to regulate most derivatives the rules could indeed make the system safer if they are aggressively enforced.         That is a big if for several reasons. For starters the C.F.T.C. itself is facing a difficult transition. Its reformist chairman Gary Gensler will leave the agency when his term concludes at the end of 2013; another Democratic commissioner has announced he will resign in 2014. Whether President Obama will nominate and fight for similarly qualified regulators to succeed them is an open question. Meanwhile Congress continues to deny the agency the resources it needs to enforce the new rules.         The effectiveness of the C.F.T.C.s efforts also depends on finishing related Dodd-Frank rules that have been delayed because they require various regulators with various agendas to agree on their final form. Such cooperation is especially difficult with financial reform because banks and the politicians and regulators who do their bidding work tirelessly to derail new regulation.         A case in point is the Volcker Rule a joint effort of the C.F.T.C. the Securities and Exchange Commission the Federal Reserve and other agencies to end speculative trading by banks. The banks want a rule with loopholes that preserve their ability to gamble and generate outsize profits and big bonuses. After tolerating years of delay Obama officials  are urging regulators  to finalize the Volcker Rule by the end of the year. That will require the agencies to say no once and for all to the banks wishes. The Fed which has a history of overprotecting banks appears to be having a particularly hard time doing that.         A strong Volcker Rule would allow banks to act as middlemen between buyers and sellers of assets but not to amass those assets and stake positions to make their own trading gains. A strong rule must also ban trading under the guise of hedging. Banks could use derivatives to hedge against direct and specific risks but not to place broad bets in the hope of big wins.         Another area where cooperation is essential  and hard to come by  is the international regulation of derivatives. Mr. Gensler fought to apply the new C.F.T.C. rules to overseas affiliates of American banks and to foreign banks that do business with them on the sound premise that the risk in those deals flows back to the United States.         But international regulators and lawmakers of both parties pushed for looser standards. The result was a set of guidelines based on substituted compliance which basically lets foreign rules apply in foreign countries as long as the C.F.T.C. deems those rules comparable. The deadline for assessing comparability is Dec. 21. It is essential that the deadline be met and that C.F.T.C. rules be swiftly applied wherever foreign law is inadequate.         A strong Volcker Rule and international oversight could go a long way toward dismantling the global casino. Thats why banks have resisted them  and why the public needs them.

254,100000002543486,0,Article,Editorial,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,Reality Sets In,THE EDITORIAL BOARD,669,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/reality-sets-in.html,10,For about a decade American military commanders leading the fight against Al Qaeda the Taliban and Saddam Hussein had a blank check from Congress to buy whatever weapons and other supplies they needed. Now the Pentagon is being forced to live with less in a new era of fiscal austerity.         With the Iraq war over and troops coming home from Afghanistan the military budget must be reduced. The question is whether we can be smart about it. The across-the-board approach dictated by the budget reductions known as the sequester  rapid steep indiscriminate cuts to both bloated programs and essential ones  is the wrong way to go causing chaos and turmoil in defense planning. Commanders say the sequester has already affected military readiness.         The Pentagons base budget was cut $37.2 billion in April as a result of the sequester. Barring a compromise deal between Republicans and Democrats the Pentagon will face an additional $52 billion cut in January bringing the total budget for 2014 down to about $475 billion. Through 2023 the cumulative defense cuts could amount to more than $1 trillion including the reductions already made.         Reality is sinking in. It was startling for instance to see that the Air Force  told The Wall Street Journal  that it is now determined to build a new long-range bomber a replacement for the storied B-52s and B-1s on a budget. The Journal reported that an Air Force manager for the $55 billion project killed a $300000 kitchenette for the plane because the feature was too expensive. Meanwhile the Navy  has pledged  to cut the costs of building the next aircraft carrier the John F. Kennedy by $1.2 billion.         Skepticism is essential when it comes to the militarys promises and projections. Cost overruns technical problems and delays have plagued most Air Force projects in recent history including the troubled and hugely overbudget F-35 fighter jet. In fact experts say over the past decade the Pentagon  wasted $46 billion  on weapons that were later canceled. Similarly the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford set to be christened on Saturday cost $12.9 billion nearly 25 percent above projections. And the Navy and its congressional supporters are trying to exempt at least one major item  submarines  from normal budget procedures to protect submarine and other shipbuilding programs experts say.         Nevertheless the budget reductions are forcing hard choices on the Pentagon that are expected to transform the institution and influence American strategy for years to come. One of the biggest decisions involves whether to spend about $300 billion  or some experts say as much as $1 trillion  over the next 30 years to modernize the submarines bombers and missiles that carry nuclear weapons. That would seem especially ill advised given that nuclear weapons are being reduced and should be reduced even more.         So where could rational cuts be made? Though determining which systems should be improved and which should be preserved is no easy task experts are weighing in with good suggestions.         A  report  issued in September by the Henry L. Stimson Center endorsed by a half-dozen former military commanders and others recommended management reforms including changes in military retirement and health benefits that could save $22.4 billion; changes to the force structure including a reduction in active-duty forces and nuclear forces that could save $21.4 billion; and $5.7 billion saved by slowing the purchases of F-35 jets and ballistic missile submarines and freezing other programs like United States-based missile defenses.         Obviously a well-defined mission would also help channel military spending to the right places. The administration is still reviewing its military priorities but Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel  said Tuesday  that future investment should focus on Special Operations forces unmanned surveillance aircraft and cyberweaponry to protect against adversaries.         It has been clear for some time that America can no longer afford unrestrained military spending. There is no alternative to making tough decisions about what is essential for the countrys defense and doing a more ruthless and creative job of controlling costs.

255,100000002543487,0,Article,Editorial,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,Kenya and the International Criminal Court,THE EDITORIAL BOARD,381,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/kenya-and-the-international-criminal-court.html,10,Two Kenyan leaders charged with crimes against humanity have retaliated with an all-out attack on the International Criminal Court. Although Kenya is a court member and President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have agreed to cooperate they are doing everything they can to discredit the institution by accusing it of racial bias and of being a Western tool.         Lets be clear: The court has the case because Kenyans refused to initiate their own process to ensure accountability for the victims of the violence that followed the 2007 election when mobs went on a rampage killing raping and setting fire to homes and businesses. More than 1100 people died in the ethnic clashes. They are the real victims here and they deserve justice.         An African Union panel led by Kofi Annan the former United Nations secretary general mediated an end to the crisis and a Kenyan inquiry commission concluded that at least some violence was organized with the aid of businessmen and politicians. The commission called for a special tribunal to bring those responsible to account. If that didnt happen it said the case should be turned over to the International Criminal Court. After the Kenyan Parliament twice rejected proposals to create a tribunal the case went to the I.C.C. prosecutor who charged six people with crimes against humanity  among them Mr. Kenyatta and Mr. Ruto who were leaders of rival political parties in 2007-8 and have since joined forces.         The charge of racism against the I.C.C. while specious has a certain appeal: Of the eight cases brought by the court all involve African states. There are indeed real questions about why charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity have not been pressed elsewhere  in Afghanistan Iraq and Syria. Still serious abuses occurred in each of the African cases now before the court and they need to be adjudicated.         While the court may be flawed it is the last resort to deliver justice for victims of conflict in countries that lack the capacity or will to do so themselves. Last May the African Union passed a resolution accusing the court of targeting Africans. What it really should have focused on and applauded is that the court is also defending Africans including the 1100 Kenyans slaughtered in 2007-8.

In a filing on Friday in Federal District Court in Manhattan the government also asked for penalties against  Rebecca Mairone  a former midlevel executive at the banks Countrywide unit whom the jury also found liable commensurate with her ability to pay.         The government said the penalties were necessary to punish the bank and Ms. Mairone and to send a clear and unambiguous message that mortgage fraud for profit will not be tolerated. Judge Jed S. Rakoff who presided over the four-week trial in Manhattan will ultimately determine the penalty.         Bank of America and Ms. Mairone were each found liable for defrauding the government-controlled mortgage companies  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  through the sale of shoddy loans bought from Countrywide in 2007 and 2008 that generated more than $1 billion in losses.         The case centered on a mortgage lending process at Countrywide which Bank of America bought in July 2008 known as the high-speed swim lane or HSSL nicknamed the hustle.         The government said the program emphasized and rewarded employees for the quantity rather than the quality of loans produced and it eliminated checkpoints intended to ensure that loans were sound.         The penalties the government requested are slightly higher than the $848.2 million that lawyers in the office of  Preet Bharara  the United States attorney in Manhattan had indicated they would seek. The amount is based on the gross loss that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac incurred on the HSSL loans the government said. Bank of America is scheduled to respond to the penalty request by Nov. 20.

Karsh  saw the buying opportunity of a lifetime.         Mr. Karsh a low-key money manager from Los Angeles had spent his career analyzing and trading the debt of companies. With the world economy buckling the prices of corporate debt had plunged to levels suggesting that much of American industry was hurtling toward bankruptcy.         So Mr. Karsh through his  Oaktree Capital Management  firm plowed money into distressed debt at a torrid pace investing more than $6 billion over a three-month stretch.         Unless the second Great Depression lies ahead  Howard S. Marks  Oaktrees chairman wrote to their clients on Oct. 6 2008 todays purchases should produce substantial returns and in a few years well reminisce together about how easy it was to take advantage of the bargains of 2008-09.         It paid off. With the help of an extraordinary government bailout and stimulus the second Great Depression never came and a global recession eventually faded. A half-decade later Mr. Markss prediction has come to pass. Virtually all of the debt bought on the cheap has fully recovered in value. The trade yielded spectacular profits earning about $6 billion in gains for Oaktrees investors and $1.5 billion for Mr. Karsh Mr. Marks and their partners.         Much attention has been lavished on the speculators who reaped huge paydays betting against the subprime mortgages that stoked the financial crisis. Doomsayers like the hedge fund manager John Paulson and the cast of characters in The Big Short the Michael Lewis book saw calamity coming and their contrarian bets delivered when the housing market collapsed.         But what about the big long? During the dark days of late 2008 while other investors dumped their holdings or sat paralyzed on the sidelines who decided that it was time to put money on the line? Who bought low and then sold high?         Warren E. Buffett of course increased his fortune during the crisis with well-publicized investments in embattled blue-chip companies like Goldman Sachs and General Electric. But a number of other lower-profile financiers also made billions by obeying one of Mr. Buffetts favorite aphorisms: Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful.          Jonathan D. Sokoloff  and his colleagues at  Leonard Green & Partners  acquired a huge ownership stake in  Whole Foods Market  at a time when many thought that this upscale grocer might not survive the downturn. Joshua J. Harris a founder of  Apollo Global Management  doubled down on a big chemical company that stood on the brink of liquidation. Oaktree scooped up corporate debt that others were discarding.         Each of these bottom-of-the-market wagers offers enduring investment lessons. But Horatio Alger stories they are not. The moneymen at the center of these trades are in the 0.01 percent  and among the most highly regarded investors on Wall Street. Their success benefited the public pension funds endowments and foundations that have money with their firms.         It also made the firms partners who receive about 20 percent of their funds gains substantially richer than they already were. Mr. Harris recently led the purchase of two professional sports teams: the Philadelphia 76ers of the N.B.A. and the New Jersey Devils of the N.H.L. Last spring Mr. Marks and his wife paid $52.5 million for a 30-room apartment at 740 Park Avenue in Manhattan.         These investors all also happen to have roots connecting them to Drexel Burnham Lambert the swashbuckling investment bank and its fabled  and convicted  junk-bond trader Michael R. Milken.         Before they started Apollo Mr. Harris and his co-founders were Drexel bankers. So were Mr. Sokoloff and his fellow managing partners. And as a young high-yield bond manager at Citibank Mr. Marks became a Milken disciple and a client of Drexel.         Although Drexel dissolved in 1990 after pleading guilty to securities fraud and Mr. Milken also admitted to crimes the banks alumni are proud of their heritage and Mr. Milkens gimlet-eyed approach to risk-taking.         What we learned at Drexel underpins our investment philosophy: Protect your downside and dont lose money Mr. Sokoloff said. Milken would say invest in times of chaos and harvest in times of prosperity.

WALD,824,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/sunday-review/fear-of-the-dark.html,4,TWO years ago the first time the government and the utility industry held an emergency drill to simulate a cyberattack on the nations power grid 75 agencies and utilities showed up. For a second drill next week organizers  are expecting  more than 200.         But it is not just the utility industry and the government that are increasingly concerned about threats to the grid. The widespread failures caused by Hurricane Sandy last year are still fresh in the minds of many Americans  especially those on the East Coast. In areas of the country where hurricanes are not terribly frequent like New York said Jay Apt the executive director of the Electricity Industry Center at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh it is a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence and that makes a big impression on folks.         Energy in general is something people like to worry about said Mr. Apt and grid failure is the latest target of that anxiety. It echoes the peak oil theme he said referring to the alarmist concern especially before the advent of fracking that oil supplies had peaked and were about to shrink with catastrophic results.         The idea of a sustained blackout resonates in the publics mind agreed David Ropeik an expert on risk perception particularly because it could come from either cyberattack physical attack by terrorists or even Mother Nature as a side effect of solar flares. It is one of those low-probability high-consequence events that every once in awhile scares the bejesus out of us he said.         Grid failure he added is the risk du jour.         It sure seems that way given the rising chatter on the web radio talk shows and in popular media. In a made-for-TV movie  American Blackout  broadcast late last month by National Geographic hackers bring down the power grid for 10 days and the country descends into Lord of the Flies savagery. NBCs hit post-apocalyptic series Revolution is set in America 15 years after the lights have gone out all over the world and Hollywood has also dabbled with grid angst as a plot device notably with the 2007 Bruce Willis movie Live Free or Die Hard.         In the recent novel  Gridlock  Byron L. Dorgan a former senator from North Dakota and his co-author David Hagberg spin a tale of a rogue Russian agent recruited by Iran and Venezuela to hire an anarchist hacker to bring down the grid in a harrowing series of rolling blackouts. And in William R. Forstchens 2009 novel One Second After bad guys cripple the grid with three small nuclear explosions in the upper atmosphere.         A couple of broader forces may be helping to stoke the growing awareness of grid vulnerability. For one thing the 2009 stimulus package pumped billions of dollars into smart meters so many Americans now realize that their electric meters formerly boring gray metal boxes clamped to the side of the house are essentially computers that can backfire on them if hacked. And as more and more people see their email accounts credit cards and even their identities hijacked they can imagine what else hackers are capable of doing.         Officials involved in next weeks drill called  GridEx II  wont say much about it in advance because they dont want to tip off the participants and may not say much after either because if the test is any good some players will fail and they dont want them to be publicly embarrassed.         Even so Brian M. Harrell the associate director of Critical Infrastructure Protection at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation which is holding the drill promised simulations of denial of service attacks in which hackers flood a computer with messages and overwhelm it as well as some coordinated physical attacks against key transmission substations and generating facilities including bombings and an active shooter scenario. (Nobodys lights will go out he promised.)         Real life at least so far has been a bit tamer but still dramatic. Bad software and bad management blacked out 50 million people from Detroit to New York City in August 2003 in an event so complicated it took engineers weeks to reconstruct what had happened. Technician error in Arizona in September 2011 blacked out seven million people in California. And Hurricane Sandy destroyed power lines and blacked out about 20 million people many for more than a week.         The federal government has instituted reliability rules  with fines for violations  on all parties on the grid and has begun talks with utility executives about how government can help recovery efforts after storms or other big events.         But because the nations grid has about 600 separate owners and their computers are heavily interconnected with links that can carry both good data and malicious code 100 percent protection against cyberattack is unlikely.         How will the public ever know that the system is adequately protected against cyberattack? For that matter how will the industry itself know? For the moment those questions are something to worry about.         Matthew L. Wald is an energy and environment reporter for The New York Times.        Also in Video »       
259,100000002543087,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,"After Mental Illness, an Up and Down Life",LEE GUTKIND,1283,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/after-mental-illness-an-up-and-down-life.html,9,TEMPE Ariz.  IN 2005 a distraught mother rushed her 13-year-old son to the emergency room for a psychiatric evaluation. The boy was overwrought consumed by anxiety. The physicians asked the standard questions: Did he want to kill or hurt himself or others? No was his answer.          The boys name was Adam Lanza. In the years between that hospital visit and the day last December when he shot to death 26 people at a Connecticut elementary school there is reason to believe he had guidance from well-meaning therapists parents and teachers. These efforts were obviously ineffective. What went wrong?         Twenty years ago I wrote a book about childhood mental illness that focused on the experiences of two struggling young people in Pittsburgh Daniel and Meggan. At the time this is what struck me most about the treatment of children and adolescents with mental health problems: Social workers and psychiatrists mostly tried their best but didnt know what they were doing really. The science was imprecise and the system was fractured.         Two decades later we are now able to see inside the brain with startling precision thanks to sophisticated imaging techniques. And we know a lot more about brain biology. But we have been unable to transform much of that knowledge into definitive treatments.         Caring for the mentally ill adult is challenging. Children are considerably more complicated because they are constantly changing and developing. Adam Lanza may have been a totally different human being in 2005 from the one he was in 2012. Or he may have been the same person displaying symptoms the experts did not then acknowledge or understand.         Recently Ive been thinking about Daniel and Meggan and wondering what happened to them. Had they ended up hurting themselves or others? Had they been able to live productive and satisfying lives?         When I met Daniel he was a scrawny 10-year-old with tight curly hair. He had a scar on his forehead where a ceiling had collapsed on him during a fire in a rooming house where his family had stashed ignored and frequently abused him. Daniel was suffering from post-traumatic shock syndrome and schizophrenia and after being removed from his family was staying at a residential treatment center  one of 13 places he lived before turning 18.         In contrast Meggan came from an upper-middle-class background but she too suffered through a series of placements. Her parents shuttled her from therapists to hospitals to special schools seeking help for and insight into her unpredictable behavior. Exhausted and nearly bankrupt they eventually gave up voluntarily relinquishing custody of their daughter to the state. This was then a frequent choice for many desperate families.         A reversal of approach has taken place since Daniels and Meggans therapeutic gantlet when nearly three-fourths of all mental health dollars for adolescents were devoted to institutional care. Today mental health professionals are more focused on keeping families together. In some states intervention teams are available to respond to children in crisis at home or at school. Drop-in centers have been established to provide families a therapeutic timeout. But these and other Band-Aid approaches are employed sporadically and often according to the United States Government Accountability Office they are administered by undertrained personnel. The system to put it bluntly is a mess.         Funding obviously is part of the problem. Fifteen million children in the United States now suffer from some mental health disorder and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that their numbers have been rising since at least the mid-1990s. But at the same time spending on mental health treatment as a share of overall health spending declined from more than 9 percent in the mid-1980s to 7.4 percent in 2004 where it remained through recent years.         Resources arent the only problem. Psychologists and psychiatrists are still befuddled by basic challenges beginning with diagnoses which for children can change as they develop. In the 1990s Meggan was told she was bipolar then 10 years later that she was a high-functioning autistic and more recently according to her mother a borderline personality. She has given up listening to doctors. I am myself she insists my own unique flavor of mental health  Meggans Syndrome  which is pretty awesome!         Lee Gutkind is  the editor  of Creative Nonfiction magazine and a writer in residence at Arizona State University who is working on a new book on childhood mental illness.

260,100000002543415,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,Is It O.K. to Kill Cyclists?,DANIEL DUANE,1422,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/is-it-ok-to-kill-cyclists.html,6,SAN FRANCISCO  EVERYBODY who knows me knows that I love cycling and that Im also completely freaked out by it. I got into the sport for middle-aged reasons: fat; creaky knees; the delusional vanity of tight shorts. Registering for a triathlon I took my first ride in decades. Wind in my hair smile on my face I decided instantly that I would bike everywhere like all those beautiful hipster kids on fixies. Within minutes however I watched an S.U.V. hit another cyclist and then I got my own front wheel stuck in a streetcar track sending me to the pavement.         I made it home alive and bought a stationary bike trainer and workout DVDs with the ex-pro Robbie Ventura guiding virtual rides on Wisconsin farm roads so that I could sweat safely in my California basement. Then I called my buddy Russ one of 13500 daily bike commuters in Washington D.C. Russ swore cycling was harmless but confessed to awakening recently in a Level 4 trauma center having been hit by a car he could not remember. Still Russ insisted I could avoid harm by assuming that every driver was a mouth-breathing drug addict with a murderous hatred for cyclists.         The anecdotes mounted: my wifes childhood friend was cycling with Mom and Dad when a city truck killed her; two of my fathers law partners maimed. I began noticing cyclist killed news articles like one about Amelie Le Moullac 24 pedaling inside a bike lane in San Franciscos SOMA district when a truck turned right and killed her. In these articles I found a recurring phrase: to quote from The San Francisco Chronicle story about Ms. Le Moullac The truck driver stayed at the scene and was not cited.         In stories where the driver had been cited the penaltys meagerness defied belief like the teenager in 2011 who drove into the 49-year-old cyclist John Przychodzen from behind on a road just outside Seattle running over and killing him. The police issued only a $42 ticket for an unsafe lane change because the kid hadnt been drunk and as they saw it had not been driving recklessly.         You dont have to be a lefty pinko cycling activist to find something weird about that. But try a Google search for cyclist + accident and you will find countless similar stories: on Nov. 2 for example on the two-lane coastal highway near Santa Cruz Calif. a northbound driver lost control and veered clear across southbound traffic killing Joshua Alper a 40-year-old librarian cycling in the southbound bike lane. As usual: no charges no citation. Most online comments fall into two camps: cyclists outraged at inattentive drivers and wondering why cops dont care; drivers furious at cyclists for clogging roads and flouting traffic laws.         My own view is that everybodys a little right and that were at a scary cultural crossroads on the whole car/bike thing. American cities are dense enough  and almost half of urban car trips short enough under three miles  that cities from Denver to Miami are putting in bike-share programs. If theres one thing New York Citys incoming and departing mayors agree on its the need for more bike lanes.         The American Medical Association endorses National Bike to Work Day and more than 850000 people commute on a bicycle according to the  League of American Bicyclists . Nationwide cycling is the second most popular outdoor activity after running supporting a $6.1 billion industry that sold 18.7 million bikes last year.         But the social and legal culture of the American road not to mention the road itself hasnt caught up. Laws in most states do give bicycles full access to the road but very few roads are designed to accommodate bicycles and the speed and mass differentials  bikes sometimes slow traffic only cyclists have much to fear from a crash  make sharing the road difficult to absorb at an emotional level. Nor does it help that many cyclists do ignore traffic laws. Every time I drive my car through San Francisco I see cyclists running stop signs like immortal entitled fools. So I understand the impulse to see cyclists as recreational risk takers who deserve their fate.         Daniel Duane is a contributing editor for Mens Journal.        Also in T Magazine »       
261,100000002543292,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,"Violence, Greed and the Gridiron",FRANK BRUNI,1177,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/bruni-violence-greed-and-the-gridiron.html,3,WHILE Tony Dorsett described the collision CNN played the footage from 1984.          Theres Dorsett the great former running back for the Dallas Cowboys carrying the ball fast downfield. And there suddenly is a Philadelphia Eagles defender shooting toward him like a burly rocket. The defenders helmet lands in the crook of Dorsetts neck; Dorsetts head snaps back so far that youd swear its connected to the rest of him by nothing more than taffy.         A freight train hitting a Volkswagen Dorsett said telling  CNNs Wolf Blitzer  in the interview last week what the moment of impact must have been like. He cant specifically recall it.         Theres so much he forgets these days. On a flight recently to the Los Angeles medical center where they studied his brain he grew confused about his destination about the reason for the trip. His memory his emotions: Theyre jumbles pieces of a puzzle in disarray. The doctors at the center confirmed why. Dorsett 59 has chronic traumatic encephalopathy or C.T.E. a degenerative brain disease that has now been found in dozens of former pro football players. Its most likely caused by big hits like the one in 1984 and little hits that happen on every play a constant thwack-thwack-thwack of a players head against his helmet. This is the reliable unremarkable percussion of the sport. This is its very rhythm.         Would I do it all over again? Dorsett said to Blitzer beating his questioner to the punch. Yes. The damage in other words is worth the thrills and not just to Dorsett who cant alter the terms of the trade-off at this befogged point. Team owners and coaches have made the same calculation. So have the money-mad executives in the National Football League and so too have we fans. All of us have entered into a compact a conspiracy. For the pleasure the sport gives us well tuck away our reservations about its culture of violence. Well turn a blind eye to the wreckage.         That wreckage isnt just physical as news last week about the vicious racist hazing of a young Miami Dolphins lineman showed. The lineman was so shaken that he fled the team. And when his departure came to light what did other Dolphins and players around the N.F.L. have to say about it? Nothing terribly empathetic. Most of the comments I saw questioned his machismo and defended the taunts and threats as jocks being jocks  or even worse as a sanctioned strategy to toughen up a wimpy newbie.         The coaches know whos getting picked on and in many cases call for that player to be singled out  wrote Lydon Murtha  a former Dolphin in a post on the Sports Illustrated website. This is a game of high testosterone with men hammering their bodies on a daily basis. You are taught to be an aggressive person. Aggression is central to the brutal ballet that we fans have grown accustomed to. Its also the path to victory and thus the road to riches. Its recruited. Rewarded.         To have our football and our fun we delete what we learned about the New Orleans Saints: that the squad had put bounties on rivals promising thousands in cash to any defensive player who knocked an opposing teams quarterback out of the game. We look past how many quarterbacks  and cornerbacks and linebackers and wide receivers  wind up prostrate on the gridiron a circle of trainers and doctors hovering over them one of the sports most familiar tableaus. In last Monday nights contest between the Green Bay Packers and the Chicago Bears the Packers star quarterback Aaron Rodgers fractured his collarbone; hell be out for several weeks just as the Bears star quarterback Jay Cutler has been. In this era of bigger bodies blunter force and rampant casualties championships dont necessarily go to the best teams but to the ones with the most men standing.         We brush that aside as we do the substance abuse and each bulletin about the latest arrest. Aaron Hernandez isnt playing tight end for the New England Patriots this year because  hes on trial for murder . If its not one alleged felony its another the on-field aggression traveling off-field to dogfights fistfights sexual assault: the high jinks of American idols in their idle time.         We minimize the relentlessness with which the sport is pursued and its message that nothing  nothing  matters more than winning. Is it coincidence that two head coaches were hospitalized this month or is it the wages of a workaholic ethos? John Fox of the Denver Broncos had emergency heart surgery. Gary Kubiak of the Houston Texans had whats sometimes called a warning stroke. The commentators wished them well and the game went on. It always does.         We minimize the tyranny of money money money. Money is surely why Dan Snyder the owner of the Washington Redskins wont change the teams name: What if too many fans were irked and too many of their dollars withheld? Money is certainly why theres now a prime-time game every Thursday night though the teams playing it get just four days of recovery from their Sunday matches an abbreviation of down time thats a potential force multiplier of injuries. Roger Goodell the leagues commissioner wont be thrown off his financial goal sketched out in a chilling  profile of him by Don Van Natta Jr.  in ESPNs magazine last March. Within 15 years Goodell wants to boost annual revenues to $25 billion from $10 billion.         THAT would be jeopardized if the N.F.L. took responsibility for the prevalence of brain disease like Dorsetts and like that of several former players including the San Diego Chargers linebacker Junior Seau whose  suffering  drove them to suicide. ( The recent $765 million settlement  of a lawsuit by more than 4500 players and their families was paltry in the context of all the lives ruined.) The leagues sustained refusal to confront this situation seriously and honestly is documented in League of Denial a book by Mark Fainaru-Wada and Steve Fainaru that was published last month.         Such a reckoning would pose an existential problem Steve Fainaru told me last week saying that if theres a definitive determination that the game itself can cause this devastating disease in a huge number of players it cant help but cause you to think: What exactly am I rooting for?         He and I were talking as two people struggling with our love of the sport. He said: Who wants to believe that all the joy that Junior Seau gave us led him to become completely unrecognizable to his family? How do we reconcile that as football fans? Some people have suggested jokingly that the book should have been called Nation of Denial.Â          He mentioned a visit that hed made to the Colosseum in Rome where gladiators once fought. At least in pro football he observed Theyre not sacrificing people at the end of the game.         I thought of Seau and of Dorsett and said: No not at the end of the game. Theyre just delaying it.         ¢ I invite you to visit  my blog  follow me on Twitter at  twitter.com/frankbruni  and join me on  Facebook .
262,100000002543398,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,Oklahoma! Where the Kids Learn Early,NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF,1032,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/kristof-oklahoma-where-the-kids-learn-early.html,1,TULSA Okla.  LIBERALS dont expect Oklahoma to serve as a model of social policy. But astonishingly we can see in this reddest of red states a terrific example of what the United States can achieve in early education.         Every 4-year-old in Oklahoma  gets free access to a year  of high-quality prekindergarten. Even younger children from disadvantaged homes often get access to full-day year-round nursery school and some families get home visits to coach parents on reading and talking more to their children.         The aim is to break the cycle of poverty which is about so much more than a lack of money. Take two girls ages 3 and 4 I met here in one Tulsa school. Their great-grandmother had her first child at 13. The grandmother had her first at 15. The mom had her first by 13 born with drugs in his system and she now has four children by three fathers.         But these two girls thriving in a preschool may break that cycle. Their stepgreat-grandmother Patricia Ann Gaines is raising them and getting coaching from the school on how to read to them frequently and she is determined to see them reach the middle class.         I want them to go to college be trouble-free have no problem with incarceration she said.         Research suggests that high-poverty parents some of them stressed-out kids themselves dont always attach to their children or read or speak to them frequently. One well-known study found that a child of professionals  hears 30 million more words by the age of 4  than a child on welfare.         So the idea is that even the poorest child in Oklahoma should have access to the kind of nurturing that is routine in middle-class homes. That way impoverished children dont begin elementary school far behind the starting line  and then give up.         President Obama called  in his State of the Union address  this year for a nationwide early education program like this for mountains of research suggests that early childhood initiatives are the best way to chip away at inequality and reduce the toll of crime drugs and educational failure. Repeated studies suggest that these programs pay for themselves:  build preschools now or prisons later .         Because Obama proposed this initiative Republicans in Washington are leery. They dont want some fuzzy new social program nor are they inclined to build a legacy for Obama. Yet national polling suggests that a majority of Republicans favor early-education initiatives so Id suggest that Obama call for nationwide adoption of The Oklahoma Project and that Republicans seize ownership of this issue as well.         Its promising that here in Oklahoma early education isnt seen as a Republican or Democratic initiative. It is simply considered an experiment that works. After all why should we squander human capacity and perpetuate social problems as happens when we dont reach these kids in time?         This isnt a liberal issue said Skip Steele a Republican who is  a Tulsa City Council member  and strong supporter of early education. This is investing in our kids in our future. Its a no-brainer.         Teachers administrators and outside evaluators agree that students who go through the preschool program end up about half a year ahead of where they would be otherwise.         Weve seen a huge change in terms of not only academically the preparation they have walking into kindergarten but also socially said  Kirt Hartzler  the superintendent of Union Public Schools in Tulsa. Its a huge jump-start for kids.         Oklahoma began a pilot prekindergarten program in 1980 and in 1998 it passed a law providing for free access to prekindergarten for all 4-year-olds. Families dont have to send their children but three-quarters of them attend.         In addition Oklahoma provides more limited support for needy children 3 and under. Oklahoma has more preschools known  as Educare schools  which focus on poor children beginning in their first year than any other state.         Oklahoma also supports home visits so that social workers can coach stressed-out single moms (or occasionally dads) on the importance of reading to children and chatting with them constantly. The social workers also drop off books; otherwise there may not be a single childrens book in the house.         The Oklahoma initiative is partly a reflection of the influence of George B. Kaiser a Tulsa billionaire who searched for charitable causes with the same rigor as if he were looking at financial investments. He decided on early education as having the highest return partly because neuroscience shows the impact of early interventions on the developing brain and partly because careful studies have documented enormous gains from early education.         So Kaiser began investing in early interventions in Oklahoma and advocating for them and because of his prominence and business credentials people listened to the evidence he cited. He also argues as a moral issue that all children should gain fairer access to the starting line.         Maybe the reason that rich smart parents had rich smart children wasnt genetics Kaiser told me but that those rich smart parents also held their kids read to them spent a lot of time with them.         I tagged along as a social worker from Educare visited Whitney Pingleton 27 a single mom raising three small children. They read to the youngest and talked about how to integrate literacy into daily life. When you see a stop sign the social worker suggested point to the letters sound them out and show how they spell stop.         Some of the most careful analysis of the Oklahoma results comes from a team at Georgetown University led by  William T. Gormley Jr.  and  published in peer-reviewed journals . The researchers find sharp gains in prereading prewriting and prearithmetic skills as well as improvements in social skills. Some experts think that gains in the ability to self-regulate and work with others are even more important than the educational gains  and certainly make for less disruptive classes. Gormley estimates that the benefits of Oklahomas program will outweigh the costs by at least a ratio of 3 to 1.         So how about it America?         Can we embrace The Oklahoma Project  not because its liberal or conservative but because its what is best for our kids and our country?

263,100000002543523,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,Why I (Still) Support Obamacare,THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN,884,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/friedman-why-i-still-support-obamacare.html,11,AT  the recent New York Times forum in Singapore  Eleonora Sharef a co-founder of HireArt was explaining what new skills employers were seeking from job applicants but she really got the audiences attention when she mentioned that her search firm was recently told by one employer that it wouldnt look at any applicant for a marketing job who didnt have at least 2000 Twitter followers  and the more the better. She didnt disclose the name of the firm but she told me that it wasnt Twitter.         At a meeting with students at Fudan University in Shanghai a few days earlier I was struck by how anxious some of the Chinese students were about the question: Am I going to have a job? If youre a software engineer in China youll do fine also a factory worker  but a plain-old college grad?  The Times reported  earlier this year that in China today among people in their early 20s those with a college degree were four times as likely to be unemployed as those with only an elementary school education.         Stories like these explain why I really hope that Obamacare succeeds. Say what?         Heres the logic: The Cold War era I grew up in was a world of insulated walls both geopolitical and economic so the pace of change was slower  you could work for the same company for 30 years  and because bosses had fewer alternatives unions had greater leverage. The result was a middle class built on something called a high-wage or a decent-wage medium-skilled job and the benefits that went with it.         The proliferation of such jobs meant that many people could lead a middle-class lifestyle  with less education and more security  because they didnt have to compete so directly with either a computer or a machine that could do their jobs faster and better (by far the biggest source of job churn) or against an Indian or Chinese who would do their jobs cheaper. And by a middle-class lifestyle I dont mean just scraping by. I mean having status: enough money to buy a house enjoy some leisure and offer your kids the opportunity to do better than you.         But thanks to the merger of globalization and the I.T. revolution that has unfolded over the last two decades  which is rapidly and radically transforming how knowledge and information are generated disseminated and collaborated on to create value  the high-wage medium-skilled job is over says Stefanie Sanford the chief of global policy and advocacy for the College Board. The only high-wage jobs that will support the kind of middle-class lifestyle of old will be high-skilled ones requiring a commitment to rigorous education adaptability and innovation she added.         But will even this prescription for creating enough jobs with decent middle-class incomes suffice asks James Manyika who leads research on economic and technology trends atÂ the McKinsey Global Institute. While these prescriptions are certainly correct notes Manyika they may not beÂ enough to solve for the scale and nature ofÂ the problem.Â The pace of technologically driven productivity growth he said suggests that we may not need as many workersÂ to drive equivalent levels of output and G.D.P.         As  the M.I.T. economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee show  in their book Race Against the Machine for the last two centuries productivity median income and employment all rose together. No longer. Now we have record productivity wealth and innovation yet median incomes are falling inequality is rising and high unemployment remains persistent.         To be sure notes Manyika a similar thing happened when we introduced technology to agriculture. We did not need as many people to produce food so everybody shifted to manufacturing. As the same thing happened there many people shifted to services.         But now adds Manyika a growing share of high-paying services and knowledge work is alsoÂ falling prey to technology. And while new companies like Twitter are exciting they do not employ people with high-paying jobs in large numbers. The economy and the service sector will still offer large numbers of jobs but many simply may not sustain a true middle-class lifestyle.         As a result argues Manyika how we think about employment to sustain a middle-class lifestyle may need to expand to include a broader set of possibilities for generating income compared with the traditional job with benefits and a well-grooved career path. To be in the middle class you may need to consider not only high-skilled jobs but also more nontraditional forms of work explained Manyika. Work itself may have to be thought of as a form of entrepreneurship where you draw on all kinds of assets and skills to generate income.         This could mean leveraging your skills through Task Rabbit or your car through Uber or your spare bedroom through AirBnB to add up to a middle-class income.Â          In the end this transition were going through could prove more exciting than people think but right now asking large numbers of people to go from being an employee to a work entrepreneur feels scary and uncertain. Having a national health care safety net under the vast majority of Americans  to ease and enable people to make this transition  is both morally right and in the interest of everyone who wants a stable society.        
264,100000002543540,0,Article,Op-Ed,Public Editor,public-editor,,Lessons in a Surveillance Drama Redux,MARGARET SULLIVAN,1475,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/public-editor/sullivan-lessons-in-a-surveillance-drama-redux.html,12,IT was almost eight years ago that The Times published  a blockbuster story  by James Risen and Eric Lichtblau about a secret Bush administration program to eavesdrop on Americans without warrants. But for many Times readers it still resonates deeply.          The 13-month delay in publishing the article a period that spanned a presidential election continues to bother these readers. Why did The Times at the urgent request of the administration wait so long? What does that say about the relationship between the government and the press? Would the same thing happen today? I hear about it often in email and online comments. It crops up  in newspaper columns  on Twitter  in journalism reviews .         Now in light of the huge leak of classified information on government surveillance from Edward J. Snowden the former contractor for the National Security Agency the episode has a renewed currency.         Mr. Snowden has said that because of this very episode he chose to take his trove elsewhere (largely to Glenn Greenwald at The Guardian to the video journalist Laura Poitras and to Barton Gellman at The Washington Post). Mr. Snowden  recently told the journalist Natasha Vargas-Cooper  that those who put themselves in danger to leak information must have absolute confidence that the journalists they go to will report on that information rather than bury it.         In recent weeks I have interviewed some of the key players in that nine-year-old drama. The episode  much written about elsewhere in  New York magazine  in  The Washington Post  in a book by Mr. Lichtblau and in a new one by Peter Baker of The Times  has gone largely unexplained in the pages of The Times itself.         The public editor at that time Byron Calame submitted a long list of questions to Times leadership but got no answers. He later  wrote about   one element of the situation establishing that the article could have appeared before the presidential election of 2004 in which George W. Bush won a second term. More recently HBO bought the rights and had a screenplay written. Certainly there is cinematic material here: The reporters who fought to publish; the government officials who wanted to kill the story (even arranging a last-ditch Oval Office meeting where Mr. Bush made the case to the Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr.); the big-name editors weighing the decision.         Given the episodes recent re-emergence I thought it might be useful to examine it here in order to give Times readers a deeper understanding of what happened and why and to explore why it matters now and what the lessons might be.         Everyone involved sees the episode as inextricably linked with its moment in time  its proximity to 9/11 and all that followed. Some also say that a tumultuous era at The Times after the Jayson Blair scandal and the flawed reporting in the run-up to the Iraq war may have made editors more cautious.         The whole confluence was pretty remarkable Mr. Lichtblau told me. Although he strongly believed and still does that the story should have run when it was first ready  the fall of 2004  he sees the historical context as a major reason that it did not.         So does Bill Keller then the executive editor who  on the recommendation of the Washington bureau chief at the time Philip Taubman  decided against running the original story.         Three years after 9/11 we as a country were still under the influence of that trauma and we as a newspaper were not immune Mr. Keller said. It was not a kind of patriotic rapture. It was an acute sense that the world was a dangerous place.         Michael V. Hayden who was the director of the N.S.A. and later the director of the Central Intelligence Agency told me in an interview that he argued strenuously against publication right up until the moment when The Times decided to go ahead. His rationale: That this effort was designed to intercept threatening communication and to prevent another terrorist attack.         In the end The Times published the story with a couple of guns held to its head: First the knowledge that the information in the article was also contained in a book by Mr. Risen State of War whose publication date was bearing down like a freight train. Second at the end the word of a possible injunction against publishing Mr. Risen said provided a final push: It was like a lightning bolt. (Mr. Hayden said that would not have happened: Prior restraint was never in the cards.)         Like a game of chicken played on a high wire it remains the most stressful and traumatic time of my life Mr. Risen recalls. Although The Times later said that further reporting strengthened the story enough to justify publishing it few doubt that Mr. Risens book was what took an essentially dead story and revived it in late 2005. Jims book was the driving force Mr. Lichtblau said.         There was another important factor he said. The Bush administration actively misled us claiming there was never a doubt that the wiretapping operations were legal. That turned out to be laughably untrue. In fact there was an imminent  revolt on this very issue  within the Justice Department.         What would happen now? What if Mr. Snowden had brought his information trove to The Times? By all accounts The Times would have published the revelations  just  as it did many WikiLeaks stories .         I think our story broke the fever Mr. Risen said. Were much better now about pushing back against government pressure. Jill Abramson the executive editor (then managing editor) has not only  defended the Snowden-related stories  as squarely in the public interest but has had Times reporters and editors collaborating with The Guardian and ProPublica on Snowden-sourced stories.

She sounds like a mom whos yelling at you. And it triggers a response.         What response does Ted Cruz trigger?         Terrifying she says. Hes disgusting and one day I Wikipedia-ed him and Im like four days older than him and it made me so depressed.         She does credit conservatives with being deviously effective at naming things. Citizens United she says. What sounds more beautiful than that?         The comedian says shes not smart enough about politics and in an HBO special airing Nov. 23 she sticks to her usual sweet depravity with jokes about rape porn Jews and her family. But she became a hilarious viral force in the last two elections.         In 2008 she did the Great Schlep video urging Jews with grandparents in Florida to withhold visits to bubbie and zadie unless they agreed to vote for Barack Obama.         In 2012 she offered Sheldon Adelson an indecent proposal involving a bikini bottom and a lesbian sexual treat if he would give $100 million to Obama instead of Mitt Romney.         She teased Mitt on Twitter asking about his sexual proclivities. And she quickly got a million views for her video slamming voter ID laws.         When a rabbi wrote to  JewishPress.com  to criticize Silvermans Let My People Vote campaign suggesting that she should channel her passion into marriage and children her dad defended her with a few of the off-color words he taught Sarah when she was a toddler.         But Silverman whose persona has always been that of the adorable pigtailed child-woman defended herself recently after some younger male comics mocked her as a crone in Hollywood terms. She admitted to W. Kamau Bell on his TV show Totally Biased that it took a couple of days to recover her self-esteem.         At a Comedy Central roast of James Franco Jonah Hill said Sarah is a role model for every little girl out there. I mean every little girl dreams of being a 58-year-old single stand-up comedian with no romantic prospects on the horizon. They all dream of it but Sarah did it. (Silverman is 42 and dates comedian Kyle Dunnigan.)         Hill also offered this shot: People say its too late for Sarah to become successful in movies at her age. I again do not agree. Its not impossible. I mean its not like theyre asking you to bear children or anything like that.         Roast Master Seth Rogen introduced her as No. 29 on Maxims Hot 100  in the year 2007.         Silverman told Bell that as soon as a woman gets to an age where she has opinions and shes vital and shes strong shes systematically shamed into hiding under a rock. And this is by progressive pop-culture people!         Looking like a lithe college girl in a blue and white striped T-shirt sweatpants sneakers and no makeup she stressed to me that everything goes at a roast and that she brutally dishes it out  she leveled fat jokes at Hill at the roast  so she has to take it.         And her philosophy is that women should not get special favors but just be the best at what they do. Thats what makes strides for women she says. Be undeniable.         Still the taunts hit a chord. You can be the toughest girl on the block and still be vulnerable as Hillary learned in New Hampshire in 2008 when she got emotional.         Silverman said she was up for a role recently and it was between me and a 25-year-old to play the love interest of the 50-year-old man and I lost it. She laughs ruefully.         These issues always come up when an actress hits a certain age and has a voice she can use she says. Its not any kind of new notion. Its just new for me you know what I mean? I love all those guys. Still I think it was O.K. to admit that it cut me. Were just made of feelings.         She adds that jokes about appearance play differently: Look Jonah Hill can be fat guys can be fat and still deserve love in this society. You know? In white America overweight women dont deserve love.         The gender divide comes up again when I ask her about having kids given her riff in the HBO special about how much she loves them.         Maybe I would have had kids if I had a wife she says. I have a lot of guy comic friends who have families because they have wives and they raise the kids. And Im on the road all the time and I date other people who are on the road. But I guess I really just was never ready. I still dont feel like Im ready. My plan is to adopt and be like young Grandma age.                Also in T Magazine »       
266,100000002543175,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,A Cure for the Allergy Epidemic?,MOISES VELASQUEZ-MANOFF,1951,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/a-cure-for-the-allergy-epidemic.html,1,WILL the cure for  allergies  come from the cowshed?          Allergies are often seen as an accident. Your immune system misinterprets a harmless protein like dust or peanuts as a threat and when you encounter it you pay the price with  sneezing   wheezing  and in the worst cases death.         What prompts some immune systems to err like this while others never do? Some of the vulnerability is surely genetic. But comparative studies highlight the importance of environment beginning it seems in the womb. Microbes are one intriguing protective factor. Certain ones seem to stimulate a mothers immune system during  pregnancy  preventing allergic disease in children.         By emulating this naturally occurring phenomenon scientists may one day devise a way to prevent allergies.         This task though still in its infancy has some urgency. Depending on the study and population the prevalence of allergic disease and  asthma  increased between two- and threefold in the late 20th century a mysterious trend often called the allergy epidemic.         These days one in five American children have a respiratory allergy like  hay fever  and nearly one in 10 have asthma.         Nine people die daily from asthma attacks. While the increase in respiratory allergies shows some signs of leveling off the prevalence of food and skin allergies continues to rise. Five percent of children are allergic to peanuts milk and other foods half again as many as 15 years ago. And each new generation seems to have more severe potentially life-threatening  allergic reactions  than the last.         Some time ago I visited a place where seemingly protective microbes occurred spontaneously. It wasnt a spotless laboratory in some university somewhere. It was a manure-spattered cowshed in Indianas Amish country.         My guide was Mark Holbreich an allergist in Indianapolis. Hed recently discovered that the Amish people who lived in the northern part of the state were remarkably free of allergies and asthma.         About half of Americans have evidence of allergic sensitization which increases the risk of allergic disease. But judging from skin-prick tests just 7.2 percent of the 138 Amish children who Dr. Holbreich tested were sensitized to tree pollens and other allergens. That yawning difference positions the Indiana Amish among the least allergic populations ever described in the developed world.         This invulnerability isnt likely to be genetic. The Amish originally came to the United States from the German-speaking part of Switzerland and these days Swiss children a genetically similar population are about as allergic as Americans.         Ninety-two percent of the Amish children Dr. Holbreich tested either lived on farms or visited one frequently. Farming Dr. Holbreich thinks is the Amish secret. This idea has some history. Since the late 1990s European scientists have investigated what they call the farm effect.         The working hypothesis is that innocuous cowshed microbes plant material and raw milk protect farming children by favorably stimulating their immune systems throughout life particularly early on. That spring morning Dr. Holbreich gave me a tour of the bonanza of immune stimuli under consideration.         We found our hosts Andrew Mast and his wife Laura hard at work milking cows in the predawn chill.         Dr. Holbreich slight and bespectacled peppered them with questions. At what age did Mr. Mast begin working in the cowshed? My first memory is of milking he said at about the age of 5. What about his children two straw-haired girls then ages 2 and 3; did they spend time in the cowshed? The elder girl came to the barn at 3 months of age he said. People learn to walk in here. Do expectant mothers work in the barn? Yes Laura said. We work.         Dr. Holbreich had made his point: whatever forces were acting here they were chronic and they began before birth. As the sun rose Dr. Holbreich and I sniffed the damp fermented feed (slightly malty); shoveled fresh cow manure (Liquid gold Dr. Holbreich said only half-jokingly the best medicine you could think of); and marveled at the detritus floating in the air. Extrapolating from previous research with each breath we were inhaling perhaps 1000 times more microbes than usual. By breakfast time grime had collected under our nails hay clung to our clothes and muck to our boots. Theres got to be bacteria mold and plant material Dr. Holbreich said. You do this every day for 30 years 365 days a year you can see there are so many exposures.         The challenge of identifying the important exposures  and getting them into a bottle  is a pressing one. In parts of the developing world where allergic disease was once considered rare scientists have noted an uptick especially in urban areas. China offers a dramatic case in point.  A 2009 study  found a more than threefold difference in allergic sensitization (as judged by skin-prick tests) between schoolchildren in rural areas around Beijing and children in the city proper. Doctor-diagnosed asthma differed sixfold. Maybe not coincidentally 40 percent of the rural children had lived on farms their whole lives.         Immigrants from the developing world to the developed tend to be  less allergic than average . But the longer they reside in their adopted countries the more allergic they become. And their native-born children seem to gain the vulnerability to asthma sometimes surpassing it. All of which highlights a longstanding question in the allergy field. As Dr. Holbreich puts it What is it about westernization that makes people allergic?         Moises Velasquez-Manoff is a science writer and the author of An Epidemic of Absence.        Also in T Magazine »

So after he finishes I come out to say hello and the look on his face  boy was he surprised.         Samsons song recalls Leachs learning the game alongside the towns Ukrainian and Icelandic youngsters who werent always fair to the native kid on borrowed skates. Leach moved on to stardom with the Boston Bruins the California Golden Seals and ultimately the Flyers.         Whereas Reggie on a playoff run could make a dad go buy a new TV         Put his youngest by the window place the split antenna in her tiny hands.         Last winter Samson  presented the song and a petition  bearing hundreds of signatures calling for Leachs election to the Hall. But Leach was not part of the induction class with Shero Chris Chelios Geraldine Heaney Scott Niedermayer and Brendan Shanahan.         Sheros Flyers brawled continually a tactic of intimidation born of the knowledge that N.H.L. referees would never call penalties with a frequency even close to the extent to which the Flyers broke the rules. In the Broad Street Bullies era Dave Schultz fought more than 120 times Bob Kelly more than 110 Andre Dupont more than 70.         While the Flyers waded into fights fists flailing at fallen opponents and goading others into dropping their gloves Leach always stayed on the periphery.         I grabbed somebody and stuff like that but I wouldnt force myself to get into a fight  it wasnt my thing Leach said. I did a lot of fighting in junior hockey and probably could have fought in the pros if I wanted to. I probably got into 13 or 14 fights as it was.         Leach was exaggerating. According to the records he was involved in four to six N.H.L. fights depending on whether a double roughing minor is counted as a fight. In any case Leach said the Flyers brawling didnt bother me at all because that was how the game was played at the time.         Anyway I wasnt there to fight Leach said. We had other guys that fought for us. Fred wanted me and Ricky MacLeish and Billy Barber and the other guys who could score to stay on the ice all the time.         And  could Leach score : a 45-goal season a 61-goal season a 50-goal season. He would shoot from anywhere and beat the lightly padded goalies of that time. In practice he would line up 20 pucks and fire each one off the crossbar missing maybe once. His linemates Bobby Clarke and Barber knew to feed him the puck.         I loved shooting the puck Leach said. Thats what I teach kids now.         After Leach retired he returned to Canada and married a beautiful native woman he said and moved to the Ojibway reserve on Manitoulin Island at the north end of Lake Huron. He said he gave up alcohol in 1984 and for years he has spoken at schools about substance abuse and maintaining values.         Leach also runs hockey clinics with his son Jamie who won a Stanley Cup during his five seasons in the N.H.L. making them the only First Nation father and son to have their names engraved on the trophy. Their company  Shoot to Score Hockey  holds clinics in First Nations and other communities across Canada.         But on Monday Leach will be in Toronto to meet Bernie Parent Don Saleski Ed Van Impe Joe and Jimmy Watson Orest Kindrachuk Larry Goodenough Dupont Clarke Barber and other former Flyers to celebrate Sheros induction and their own achievements of four decades ago.         Whereas photos from the old Tribune Reggie smiling with the Stanley Cup         Curled their corners dropped off bedroom walls left a square where they used to be.         Therefore we the undersigned put forth his name to the Hockey Hall of Fame.         Samsons  online petition  has more than 3200 signatures.         The impact of a player like Reggie goes far beyond stats and awards Samson said. His actual impact especially on indigenous people and as a recovering addict is as profound as any inductees.         Leach said that joining other native players like Bryan Trottier and George Armstrong in the Hall of Fame would be nice but Im not going to lose any sleep over it.         He added: For me the people who want me in the Hall of Fame  theyre my Hall of Famers. Im happy for that.

Â           To the Editor:   Fifty years of Supreme Court tinkering with our political system has resulted in a democracy so dysfunctional that no rational person would choose it.         The people through their elected representatives gave us an effective Voting Rights Act to protect minority voters. The Supreme Court  told us  that we dont need it anymore. The people gave us a campaign finance law limiting the expansive political power of the rich. The Supreme Court  told us  that unlimited campaign spending by the 1 percent doesnt corrupt the democratic process.         The people gave us a practical way to allow underfunded candidates to compete with rich ones. The Supreme Court  told us  that it was unfair to the rich. The people walled off the vast trove of corporate wealth from our elections. The Supreme Court  told us  that unlimited corporate electioneering was good for us.         The people drew legislative lines to help racial minorities recover from centuries of political exclusion. The Supreme Court  told us  that it was a dangerous form of racism. But when todays politicians entrench themselves in power by putting hurdles in the way of poor people voting gerrymandering district lines to assure the re-election of incumbents and stacking the electoral deck in favor of the majority party the Supreme Court  just stands by .         In the dysfunctional democracy the justices have made the Supreme Court can even  pick a president .         The extreme wings of each major party control the nominating process. Poor people have to jump through hoops to vote. The party in power controls the outcome in too many legislative elections. And the superrich have turned too many of our elected representatives into wholly owned subsidiaries and most of our elections into auctions.         Madison would weep.         BURT NEUBORNE
272,100000002540477,0,Article,News,Job Market,jobs,,Embracing the Millennials’ Mind-Set at Work,TOM AGAN,733,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/jobs/embracing-the-millennials-mind-set-at-work.html,8,Are millennials  those born from roughly 1980 to 2000  about to fundamentally change companies for the better? Yes if companies dare to listen.          Older generations of workers are sometimes annoyed and perplexed by millennials many of whom want to take on big projects and responsibilities right off the bat whereas earlier generations expected to pay their dues first. Millennials are also accustomed to living in a world of vast transparency  tweeting texting and emailing one another in a nonstop exchange of information and opinions.Â          I worked with one executive who was starting a big I.T. project  and she was shocked and a little embarrassed to learn that her mostly-millennial team had identified a lack of support for the effort among higher-ups. How? During her introductory presentation they sent instant messages among themselves and to others in the company and figured it out.         The book  Why Nations Fail  by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson sheds light on why millennials are uniquely situated to take innovation to a new level. When a small closed group of elites holds power it tends to limit information and education and resist innovations that threaten its strength the authors explain. By contrast innovation thrives when information is unfettered education is nurtured people can readily form new groups and decision-making is inclusive. These circumstances offset the strong tendency of those in power to resist change  in a country or at a company.         Social media permeate the personal academic political and professional lives of millennials helping to foster the type of environment where innovation flourishes. So when compared with older generations millennials learn quickly  and thats the most important driver of innovation.         When I worked at Nielsen I led a quantitative study of major consumer companies like Kraft and Procter & Gamble  research that demonstrates the link between learning and innovation. The study found that employees were likely to generate more revenue if they held mandatory meetings to identify the strengths and weaknesses of new products after their introduction used a consistent set of questions to do so and recorded what they learned.         Â At some companies and universities smart leaders are already tapping into millennials abilities. For instance when leading conference calls one senior executive I know asks younger staff members to introduce the instant messages they send during the meeting directly into the discussion. Rather than keeping the two streams of information separate he is intentionally encouraging and inviting the parallel conversation into the mix.         At Northwestern University teams of undergraduate and graduate students  guided by older experienced faculty members and alumni andÂ often paired with senior-level researchers  create plans for start-ups in an interdisciplinary series of classes  called NUvention . Over the last two years three of these teams have won first- or second-place awards in the  Rice Business Plan Competition  to the tune of more than $1.5 million in prize money. And the winning teams have gone on to raise over $1 million each.         Mike Marasco the leader of the NUvention program puts it this way: Millennials work more closely together leverage right- and left-brain skills ask the right questions learn faster and take risks previous generations resisted. They truly want to change the world and will use technology to do so.         Â To compete for the best millennial talent companies are having to change in fundamental ways. Goldman Sachs for example recently announced its intention to improve the work environment of its junior bankers  by having them work less . Of course that flies in the face of Wall Street tradition in which new recruits often work late into the night and for entire weekends.         Goldman made the change partly because it was losing millennials to start-ups. But start-ups typically offer less pay and equally long hours which suggests that providing more time off isnt the only answer. If corporate cultures dont align with the transparency free flow of information and inclusiveness that millennials highly value  and that are also essential for learning and successful innovation  the competitiveness of many established businesses will suffer.         Millennials are becoming more aware of their rising worth. Coupling their ability to learn quickly with their insistence on having a say they pack a powerful punch. But rather than complaining its time to embrace millennials for what they can offer to add experience from older workers to the mix and to watch innovation explode.

273,100000002542601,0,Article,News,Your Money,your-money,,"Mug-Shot Websites, Retreating or Adapting",DAVID SEGAL,1004,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/your-money/mug-shot-websites-retreating-or-adapting.html,3,In this episode a pair of updates.         The first is about a company called CreditCardMachineRentals.com which acknowledged owing $6600 to a charity for charging it excessive late fees  as described here  two weeks ago. When the Haggler contacted Jeremy Roberts who owns the company he first said hed already sent the refund. Then he got in touch with his bank and reported that no he had not. Then he went silent and the website to his company went dark. Or rather it went from a viable e-commerce site to one with a lot of white space and nothing but an image of a red lock and the words The website you are looking for has been closed.         Between his sudden silence and his flatlined website you got the impression the man had vanished. Wrong. A rep from the charity Smart From the Start emailed the Haggler soon after the columns publication to say that a check from Mr. Roberts had arrived. It has since been cashed.         Why you may wonder would Mr. Roberts not convey this rather important and flattering morsel of news to the Haggler before the column ran? Reader you ask a fine question. One that the Haggler posed to Mr. Roberts last week via text. To which he did not reply. Not a peep. His website meanwhile is back up and running.         The world is a mysterious place.         But enough of that. Lets turn now to mug shots. Readers of this section may recall that the Hagglers duller windier alter ego  wrote in early October  about websites that publish mug shots and then charge arrestees to purge the images. Many of the people whose pictures fill the sites were found not guilty or the charges against them were dropped. But those images linger often on multiple mug-shot sites  there are dozens of them with names like JustMugShots.com  unless a person forks over the roughly $300 to $400 that each site demands to remove them.         During the reporting for that article MasterCard American Express Discover and PayPal announced that they would sever ties to mug-shot sites while  Visa  said it would ask merchant banks to investigate whether the sites are illegal.         And a  Google  rep said it would change its algorithm in ways that demoted the sites in search results.         Kind of a double-whammy for mug-shot site owners it seems. They suddenly faced serious hurdles in getting paid. And who would pay if mug-shot sites didnt turn up high in Google search results?         The Haggler was curious about what happened since the article was published.         Quite a lot it turns out. At least one of the larger sites Mugshotsonline.com seems to have abandoned the basics of its business model. Click on a mug shot there and you now get a pop-up that reads in part: Effective immediately we will no longer be accepting payment for any record removal. Please check back with us in the next few weeks for further information and removal instructions for expunged sealed or deceased cases.         How come? A rep from Citizens Information Associates which owns Mugshotsonline.com emailed a news release dated Oct. 30 that included this line: The change in policy will reflect the new realities of the regulatory and merchant processing environment.         The owner of JustMugshots.com Arthur DAntonio III was somewhat more expansive. His site apparently is back in the deletion business because it found a way to process credit card transactions Â with options to use Visa and Discover posted on the site. How did Mr. DAntonio manage that?         Id rather not go into it he said.         Discover said that the site was simply using its logo and that transactions could not actually be processed using its card. Visa on the other hand pointed to its statement that said merchant banks would examine their relationships with mug-shot websites and take action only if the companiesÂ  were breaking laws or violating terms of their contracts. The sites appear to be legal so Visa has allowed those banks to continue to do business with them.         The Google algorithm change seems to have had a more sustained impact.         Searches where youd have found us on the first page were now on Page 5 Mr. DAntonio continued. And there is very little we can do about that.         Another large site mugshots.com was angry enough about the algorithm change that it posted a 4500-word rant on its blog asserting that Google had imperiled Americans who no longer have a quick simple way to determine if someone is dangerous. This would make more sense if the company were vigilant about deleting the records of people who are never charged or who are found innocent.         It is hard to know who owns mugshots.com or where its based. (There is a Nevis West Indies address on the site for what that is worth.) A few days after the article a man named Marc Gary Epstein filed an application on behalf of a company called Unpublish  which handles deletion transactions for mugshots.com  with the Florida Department of State to register as a foreign company. Attempts to reach Mr. Epstein were not successful.         The Haggler is here for you Mr. Epstein if youd like to talk.         One other development: Scott A. Ciolek the Toledo lawyer who has filed a class-action lawsuit against several mug-shot websites received a death threat last week via email. I hope you got good funeral arrangements was one of the few printable lines from this message. For good measure the anonymous menacer posted on what is putatively a consumer complaint aggregator two vicious reviews of Mr. Cioleks work as a lawyer  reviews that leveled accusations of racism alcoholism and a few other isms. The site charges $499 to delete such posts.         I spoke to federal marshals about this yesterday Mr. Ciolek said on Tuesday referring to the death threat. As for those nasty posts he added Im now dealing with the same issues that all these people with posted mug shots have been dealing with for years.         Email: haggler@nytimes.com.

274,100000002540505,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,,"Work Up a Sweat, and Bargain Better",MATT RICHTEL,600,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/business/work-up-a-sweat-and-bargain-better.html,6,If better health isnt enough incentive to take a brisk walk perhaps there is another one: it may get you a better deal.          New research from the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  offers a twist on the adage never let them see you sweat says  Jared Curhan  associate professor of organization studies at M.I.T.s Sloan School of Management and one of the studys co-authors. If youre sweating and your heart rate is up its seen as a sign something is going wrong that youre too nervous off-balance flustered he said. Whereas were showing that something could be very right.         Professor Curhan and his colleagues found that a person who negotiates while moving  say pacing while bargaining over job terms on the cellphone  can see improved results. But there is of course a rub. The better outcomes seen with exertion tend to come only to people who are confident heading into the negotiation in the first place. If instead they are nervous walking may actually hamper performance.          The study  published recently in the journal Psychological Science involved two experiments. One compared the experience of subjects who negotiated to buy a car on a cellphone while walking briskly on a treadmill (their heart rates averaged 117 beats a minute) against the experience of others who walked at a more modest pace (88 beats a minute). A second experiment compared the experiences of subjects negotiating for job terms on a cellphone; some subjects took a casual walk while others sat in a chair.         As conventional wisdom would suggest those who dreaded negotiation performed even worse when they exerted themselves. What was more surprising was that those who looked forward to negotiation displayed the opposite results: In the job-negotiation experiment they performed better and felt better about their performances when they were walking. And in the treadmill experiment the confident negotiators felt that they performed better when their heart rates were elevated  more so than equally confident people who walked at a modest pace.         The results provide a real-world application to a decades-old body of science about the relationship between physical and mental states. It turns out that its very easy to confuse the two. That is because broadly speaking emotions consist of two factors: a physiological response and how a person experiences and labels it.         In other words one person might call a racing heart and sweaty palms anxiety and another might call it excitement. Recent research from  Alison Wood Brooks  a scholar now at the Harvard Business School shows that people perform better in a range of pursuits  singing public speaking math  if they can take note of the physiological responses and relabel their feelings as excitement as opposed to anxiety.         Ms. Brooks said the research would apply to negotiation. Her advice is for people to reappraise anxiety as excitement. This can be accomplished she said even by simply saying Im excited. Earlier research shows that anxiety can be so debilitating that it causes people to make low first offers exit early and earn less profit.         She said the new M.I.T. research showed a way to counter these forces.         Get on the treadmill get your heart racing and once its racing appraise the feeling as excitement  tell yourself I am excited not anxiousÂ  she said. And then go forth and prosper.         One thing that is not clear from the M.I.T. study is just how much physical exertion makes sense in negotiation. For now said Ashley Brown the lead author of the study who is now a psychology researcher at Stanford I wouldnt suggest doing a marathon.        
275,100000002543715,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,football,"Dolphins, a Franchise Under Fire, Now Under a Microscope",KEN BELSON,1098,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/sports/football/dolphins-a-franchise-under-fire-now-under-a-microscope.html,3,MIAMI GARDENS Fla.  Some days the  Miami Dolphins  owner Stephen Ross must wonder why he bought the team.         Since he took full control in 2009 the Dolphins have not had a winning record coaches and quarterbacks have come and gone and season-ticket sales have dipped to a three-decade low.         This year Ross failed to win $200 million in subsidies to help overhaul the Dolphins stadium and his fellow N.F.L. owners passed over Miami to host the Super Bowl in 2016 2017 and 2018. Ross took aim at lawmakers who refused to support the stadium deal. The local news media then criticized Ross for donating $200 million to his alma mater Michigan.         But these setbacks were a footnote compared with the unfolding and explosive story involving allegations of bullying and racial discrimination on the team as it prepares for Mondays game against Tampa Bay.         Richie Incognito the teams outspoken guard has been suspended indefinitely amid claims that he bullied his teammate Jonathan Martin who has left the team. The N.F.L. has hired a high-profile lawyer to investigate conflicting reports and publish his findings which are likely to provide a rare glimpse into N.F.L. locker room culture.         The public spat involving millionaire players who worked side by side on the Dolphins offensive line has the potential to not only damage the teams credibility but also unleash a legal storm that could swirl around the team for months.         What the story of Jonathan Martin teaches us is that the N.F.L. locker room is in some ways no different than any other workplace in America because all employers should proactively protect themselves against workplace bullying said Nicholas Reiter a lawyer who represents employers for Venable LLPs Labor and Employment Group. Employers are charged with running a workplace free of discrimination and harassment based on their workers race gender or other legally protected characteristic.         As part of their agreement with the N.F.L. the Dolphins have agreed not to talk about the case until the league has finished its review.         Incognito and Martin have not sued the team and it is unclear whether either one will take legal action. The leagues collective bargaining agreement with the players could cover some claims that would be heard by an arbitrator. The two sides may be waiting until Ted Wells a top defense lawyer publishes his report though he has no deadline for doing so.         The report could be a big moment in the bargaining power of one side or another Reiter said.         Wells has led other special investigations in sports. He was hired by the N.B.A. players union to look into allegations of inappropriate financial dealings within it. His report led to the  ouster of Billy Hunter  the unions chief.         This has raised the specter that coaches and some team officials may be accused of wrongdoing and perhaps dismissed. In theory N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell who punished the New Orleans Saints for operating a bounty system that rewarded players for hurting opponents could penalize the Dolphins though the cases are different.         While Incognito has been largely silent Martin hired David Cornwell who has represented other athletes. On Thursday Cornwell said in a statement that Martins toughness was not at issue only his treatment by his teammates.         Jonathan endured harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker room hazing he wrote.         Amid all the turmoil Ross has kept a low profile. Last week he said the team would cooperate with Wellss investigation.         As the owner I am committed to creating a professional environment for all of the members of the Dolphins family he said.         The circus surrounding the Dolphins could derail their chance of making the playoffs for the first time since 2008. To get back on track the Dolphins signed several big-name free agents in the off-season including wide receiver Mike Wallace. At the midway point in the season the team is 4-4 a half-game behind the Jets for the second A.F.C. wild-card spot.         Now the players and coaches will have to answer questions by Wells and his team of investigators as well as from a bevy of reporters an unwelcome intrusion.

Given these myriad options why is Robert H. Frank so concerned about adding a few more casinos to the state ( Dancing With Temptation in a Casino Vote  Economic View Nov. 3)?         Hard-core gamblers can now lose their money in casinos in Connecticut or New Jersey. If they are going to gamble anyway New York State shouldnt be deprived of the additional revenue.         ALEX KOLBEN         MANHATTAN NOV. 3         TO THE EDITOR:         Considering that New York State has been observing a de facto moratorium on hydraulic fracturing I fail to see how the states voters could agree to allow casinos that support the addiction of gambling and the disastrous spillovers that accompany it.         The addiction to energy sources is likewise creating absurd contradictory choices in our country. But while the moratorium on fracking is supposed to allow more time to access its effects on health and the environment I believe that the disturbing results of gambling addictions are already widely documented.

The answer seems pretty clear. In 1955 a standard soda at McDonalds was only seven ounces. Today a medium is three times as large and even a childs-size version is 12 ounces. Its a widely held view that obesity is a consequence of our behaviors and that behavioral economics thus plays a central role in understanding it  with markets preferences and choices taking center stage. As a behavioral economist I subscribed to that view  until recently when I began to question my thinking.         For many health problems of course behavior plays some role but biology is often a major villain. Biology here is my catchall term for the myriad bodily mechanics that are only weakly connected to our choices. A few studies have led me to wonder whether the same is true with obesity. Have I been the proverbial owner of a (behavioral) hammer looking for (behavioral) nails everywhere? Have I failed to appreciate the role of biology?         A first warning sign comes from looking at other animals. Our pets have been getting fatter along with us. In 2012 some 58.3 percent of cats were literally fat cats. That is taken  from a survey  by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention. (The very existence of this organization is telling.) Pet obesity however can easily be tied to human behavior: a culture that eats more probably feeds its animals more too.         And yet a study by a group of biostatisticians in the  Proceedings of the Royal Society  challenges this interpretation. They collected data from animals raised in captivity: macaques marmosets chimpanzees vervets lab rats and mice. The data came from labs and centers and spanned several decades. These captive animals are also becoming fatter: weight gain for female lab mice for example came out to 11.8 percent a decade from 1982 to 2003.         But this weight gain is harder to explain. Captive animals are fed carefully controlled diets which the researchers argue have not changed for decades. Animal obesity cannot be explained through eating behavior alone. We must look to some other  biological  driver.         Fittingly the study is titled Canaries in the Coal Mine. Could our inability to explain animal obesity with behavior be a warning sign? Perhaps we are also overlooking biological drivers for human obesity. But what might these culprits be?         A particularly interesting candidate resides in your gut. Your digestive system is actually a complex ecosystem playing host to hundreds of species of bacteria that do things as diverse as fermenting undigested  carbohydrates  and providing  vitamins . They also regulate how much fat your body stores.         Not everyone however has the same gut bacteria. And interestingly the composition of this bacteria correlates with obesity. Of course this relationship could be simple: the obese eat differently and therefore they have different bacteria.         But a  recent study  in the journal Science showed that cause and effect could go the other way as well. Researchers harvested bacteria from pairs of human twins where one twin was obese and the other was not. Then they transplanted these bacteria into mice. The mice who received bacteria from the obese twin gained weight while the others did not. The mice did not eat more: Their metabolism changed so that they put on more weight even with the same caloric input.         What then determines your gut bacteria? It could be  antibiotics  or environmental toxins or how processed your food is. Another possibility is raised by a study in The New England Journal of Medicine   that shows  that obesity seems to spread across social networks with people infecting their friends and neighbors. I had always assumed that was because birds of a feather flock together  and that is surely part of the explanation.Â But because gut bacteria can also spread among people in close proximity perhaps the obesity epidemic really is well an epidemic?         Im not arguing that behavior does not matter. Biology and behavior often interact; the spread of  flu  depends on whether we wash our hands. Similarly the bacteria study found that the obese gut bacteria had an impact only when the mice were fed diets heavy in saturated fats.         Perhaps most interestingly changing biology may even be changing cravings. Some biologists have hypothesized that our gut bacteria actually drive cravings for certain unhealthy foods. A focus on biology doesnt mean a reduced emphasis on behavior just a richer understanding of it.         These and other studies raise important possibilities which deserve more research and attention. At the very least we should invest as many obesity research dollars in uncovering and understanding these biological channels as we do in understanding behavioral channels. And this is a behavioral economist talking!         After all this could radically change the way we think about policies to curb obesity. As one newspaper editorial pronounced:         A little town in Sweden has put a local tax on fat men. It is declared that the fat man stands accused by the very fact of his too solid flesh (vide Hamlet) of gluttony and laziness. Millions of fat men throughout the world may rise up and denounce as liars the town councillor who drew up this cruel indictment and those who voted for it but the gentler way of reproving them would be to point out the tritely recognised danger of generalisation in almost any statement of supposed fact. Not all fat men are lazy and gluttonous. Obesity is in many a congenital habit of body; in others a disease.          That editorial  was written in 1923 for the paper known as The Paris Herald. Maybe the writer was on to something.         SENDHIL MULLAINATHAN is a professor of economics at Harvard. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 17 2013 Because of an editing error the Economic View column last Sunday about possible causes of obesity misstated the source of bacteria that were transplanted into mice as part of an obesity study. The bacteria came from human twins not from other mice.
279,100000002543287,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,,"Earnings, but Without the Bad Stuff",GRETCHEN MORGENSON,1043,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/business/earnings-but-without-the-bad-stuff.html,1, Twitter s red-hot stock offering last week makes clear that as in the first Internet bubble investors will pay up for a company even if it hasnt turned a profit.         And managers of companies that have generated only losses like Twitter  and even those that are profitable  are happy to suggest metrics that they think are better suited for assessing their operations.         Managements recommended measures typically not found in generally accepted accounting principles have an uncanny way of burnishing a companys results. They do so by eliminating some pesky costs of doing business.         As such these benchmarks are also known as earnings without the bad stuff. They were central to the valuations that propelled Internet stocks skyward in the late 1990s. Then the higher the market climbed the kookier the metrics became.         My favorite measure was used by analysts to hype the prospects of Homestore.com a web-based provider of real estate services. They lauded its potential because of the share of mind it enjoyed among its customers.         That share may have been meaningful in early 2000 as the companys stock hit $489 but it vanished quickly when Homestore.com crashed  in 2001.  (Stuart Wolff a former C.E.O. was sentenced to prison in 2010 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud.) The company now operates as Move Inc.; its stock closed Friday at $16.09.         What costs do companies want investors to remove from the income statement? Among the most popular are those associated with stock-based compensation like options and restricted stock. Because these forms of pay arent made in cash the theory goes they should be backed out of a companys expenses.         Twitters recent prospectus serves as an example. Its management suggests that investors not focus solely on its $134 million net loss for the first nine months of 2013 a figure calculated under generally accepted accounting principles. If you want to see the companys operating results through the eyes of management the prospectus suggests look at its non-GAAP net loss of $44 million for the period.         To get to that figure Twitter backs out two large costs. Stock compensation for the first three quarters of 2013 is the biggest at $79 million. Twitter also removes $11 million in costs associated with amortizing or reducing the value of intangible assets it acquired previously.         Theres nothing improper in Twitters filing. But the idea that these items dont cost the company is nonsense says Jack T. Ciesielski an accounting expert at R.G. Associates in Baltimore and publisher of  The Analysts Accounting Observer .         When they back out stock-based compensation theyre basically saying that management is working for free Mr. Ciesielski said. And we know thats not the case.         Ditto for the intangibles he said. When they acquired a company they spent money for things like in-process research and development contracts and customer lists he added. To back out those intangibles is bogus.         Twitter is just one of many companies that point shareholders to rosier earnings measures. And when they do so theyre adhering to a 2002 rule prescribed by the  Securities and Exchange Commission  in response to the Enron and WorldCom accounting frauds. That rule known as  Regulation G  allows companies to use nontraditional metrics in financial reports but only if they present generally accepted accounting measures alongside so that investors can compare the two.         If the S.E.C. wanted its rule to discourage accounting gimmickry it failed Mr. Ciesielski said. The S.E.C. inadvertently legitimized the practice with Regulation G he added. Its defining behavior down  once people start doing this everybodys got to be on the same page. If company Y is backing out stock-based compensation why wouldnt company X do the same? Its results would only look worse if it didnt.         To plumb the popularity and pervasiveness of such metrics Mr. Ciesielski and his associates analyzed filings from technology and health care companies in the Standard & Poors 500-stock index. They identified those that presented nontraditional figures to investors and compared those results with the companies actual earnings for 2011 and 2012.         Technology and health care industries are both heavy users of adjusted earnings measures in their financial statements Mr. Ciesielski said. Of the 69 technology companies in the index he found that 56 used non-GAAP earnings presentations; of the 54 health care companies 45 used them.

281,100000002543224,0,Article,News Analysis,Sunday Review,opinion,Sunday Review,Good Deals on Pills? It’s Anyone’s Guess,ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,1115,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/sunday-review/good-deals-on-pills-its-anyones-guess.html,5,THIS month a dysfunctional website stymied hundreds of thousands of Americans trying to check out new  health insurance  options under the Affordable Care Act. But that embarrassing technical glitch may have masked a more fundamental question: Can Americans shop effectively for health care?          Most developed countries do not even ask their citizens to be smart health care consumers; in one way or another they control prices and offer a more constrained array of options. But Americans are fans of freedom and choice  or at least the illusion of it. And they have cast their lot with so-called consumer driven health care.         In the past five years there has been a proliferation of services to help consumers with their deliberations. The American Board of Internal Medicine began the Choosing Wisely campaign to steer patients away from tests that may be unnecessary. Websites like Health Care Bluebook Fair Health and Clear Health Costs use insurance databases and patient crowdsourcing to find the going rates in local areas. The Affordable Care Act provides $70 million for patient navigators to find the best deals for particular health needs.         Useful tools to be sure. But many economists say that placing the onus on buyers is unrealistic and unfair especially given the way a vast majority of Americans get their health care. You cant really be a well-informed consumer right now because our current system is not set up to give the consumer relevant information on price quality services and access said Glenn Melnick professor of health care finance at the University of Southern California.         Try to be a smart shopper for something basic: a medicine you take every day for a chronic condition like  high blood pressure . That should be simple right? Hardly.         There are some great new technologies to offer guidance for pill purchases such as  GoodRx.com  a company founded by veterans of Facebook and Yahoo (the type of A team experts that Kathleen Sebelius the secretary of health and human services only belatedly drafted to troubleshoot healthcare.gov). The site and its app provide granular information on prescription prices in your area and coupons for deep discounts.         Our mission is to bring transparency to this space said Doug Hirsch one of the companys co-founders. We have billions of scrips in our database so you can see what it is at your local pharmacy and can look at the gazillions of discounts involved. Just over a year old the site use is growing 20 to 30 percent a month.         A few minutes on the site shows what Mr. Hirsch calls extraordinary price variations: drugs that sell for $150 a month at one pharmacy are given away to members of a loyalty program at another. I discovered that a generic prescription anti-inflammatory medicine for which I now pay a $20 monthly co-pay through my insurer is on Targets limited list of $4 prescriptions although other drugs are far more expensive there.         Unfortunately GoodRx brings transparency to just one aspect of a system that remains an impenetrable black box in other respects. To know if the deals are beneficial for example you need to know what your insurance would otherwise require you to pay. Will it be a set co-pay a percentage of the full price  whatever that is  or no coverage at all? And that is determined by back-room negotiations between insurers and drug makers pharmacies and middlemen producing pricing that shifts from month to month and year to year.         On Jan. 1 tens of thousands of Americans will be shocked to discover that longstanding prescriptions for Advair the most popular daily inhaler for adults with  asthma  is  no longer covered  by Medco/Express Scripts the largest private pharmacy benefit manager in the country. Patients will have to pay the retail price of $300 themselves.         The logic for exclusion is that there are other branded inhalers containing similar types of medicines that will be eligible (specifically Symbicort and Dulera) ones that are somewhat cheaper and should work as well. There is no generic for Advair.         Rhinocort AQ a popular nasal spray that retails for more than $150 will be excluded by both Express Scripts and Caremark the other large pharmacy manager.         SUCH sudden shifts mean that shoppers need to be ever vigilant to get a good deal on their medicines: Your pharmacys current discount program may cover the 20 milligram dose when you normally take 10. The lowest price on your  migraine  medicine may be at a different chain than where you get your high blood pressure pill. The best offer of all may come from the drug maker in the form of a coupon to cover your co-pay a controversial but widespread practice.         And then theres the issue of access: Target sells my medicine for $4 for example but theres no Target near where I live and its a bit of a pain to move my prescription.         Now imagine scaling up this byzantine process to shop for a truly complicated purchase like bypass surgery or  cancer  treatment. Some online services are using billing databases and crowdsourcing to give you a sense of what different doctors and hospitals are charging. But what about quality?         At the extreme end of the marketplace model is MediBid an online service through which patients can solicit bids from physicians for needed procedures. It was founded by Ralph Weber a financial consultant and insurance cannot be used. But the savings can be substantial for those without insurance or with a high-deductible policy.         After Mr. Webers wife recently got an estimate of more than $14000 for arthroscopic knee surgery near the couples Tennessee home (not including the doctors fee) he put the procedure out to bid. He ended up driving his wife to Charlottesville Va. to take advantage of a $3700 offer. This year his service has sent patients for total hip replacements to Glendale Calif. ($14450 all inclusive) San Antonio ($19000) and Oklahoma ($12500). The usual cost runs more than $40000 and in some cities far more.         Many new health insurance policies  including those under the Affordable Care Act  are trying to prod us to become better consumers of health care by forcing us to pay a percentage of our bills. If you currently pay a fixed $20 co-pay you wont care much about the price but if you pay 20 percent it will matter a lot if your scan costs $200 or $2000. Is that fair?         Until there is as much price transparency as there is for laundry soap as much local competition is there is for gas and as much freedom to choose between brands as there is for cars even the smartest consumer may not get a good deal.         Elisabeth Rosenthal is a reporter for The New York Times who is writing a series about the cost of health care  Paying Till It Hurts. 
282,100000002543988,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,basketball,What Sets Spurs Apart Is Lost on Knicks,HARVEY ARATON,920,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/sports/basketball/what-sets-spurs-apart-is-lost-on-knicks.html,5,Once every season the  San Antonio Spurs  visit Madison Square Garden  as they are scheduled to do Sunday afternoon  to remind the  Knicks  in a larger contextual sense of everything they are not. And that is not good.         Over the last decade and a half the Spurs have built one of the most stable and enduring foundations in the history of professional basketball. On the other end of the N.B.A. spectrum we have  James L. Dolan s Knicks a metaphorical Legoland.         This is not to discount New Yorks 54 victories last season the possibility of a repeat performance or the fine people who have taken on the challenge of trying to make the Knicks meaningfully competitive again. But under Dolans tempestuous ownership too many of those folks have come and gone in a Manhattan minute hired fired and summarily forgotten.         With an ideologically opposite approach to Dolans method of ownership by the whim of his warring emotions the Spurs in the past 16 years have the best winning percentage of any major American sports franchise. They have won four championships and they fell short of a fifth last season by the narrowest of margins.         The Knicks whose N.B.A. title drought dates to 1973  to be fair long before Dolan  have won one playoff series in 13 years and seven since the Spurs drafted Tim Duncan in 1997 compared with San Antonios 30.         The Spurs coach has for years been affectionately known as Pop. In Dolans Garden coaches and assorted executives though handsomely paid have been treated like children.         Since Pop or Gregg Popovich took a seat on the Spurs bench in 1996 the Knicks have had eight head coaches including Herb Williams who handled the team for one game in 2004 and for 43 as an interim coach in 2005.         Since the management duo of Popovich  who also holds the title of team president  and R. C. Buford the general manager united in San Antonio the Knicks have had six men in charge of their basketball operation. Three have called the personnel shots in the last three-plus seasons. Donnie Walsh was downgraded from president to long-distance adviser after digging the team out of a salary-cap hole the size of the Grand Canyon.         The latest change  Steve Mills in as president and Glen Grunwald out as general manager  bizarrely occurred on the eve of training camp months after the Knicks won those 54 games and their first playoff series since 2000.         In a 2012  interview  Duncan referred to the Spurs organizational continuity as a reason he only once considered playing elsewhere (Orlando) but ultimately stayed where he could count on his playoff bread being buttered.         With the teams weve had with the focus of the people here wanting to put winning teams together of having a system and sticking to it theres no better way to do it  Duncan  said. In other places coaches come in and out and there are guys who have four or five in the same amount of years and thats a situation I can see why youd want to get out of.         This is where Dolan would probably grunt and argue that the Spurs strategy has worked for them in large part because they have little else to offer in San Antonio. And that they lucked into Duncan in the draft lottery after being accused of tanking the previous season.         That may be true but when the pre-Dolan Knicks won the first lottery in 1985 which brought them Patrick Ewing they surrounded him with chaos for a few years never delivered a true companion co-star and never won a title.         In pre-Pat Riley days Ewing actually tried to explore free agency through a contract technicality but failed. More than 20 years later Carmelo Anthony has disclosed his intention to become a free agent next spring while no doubt wondering if the continual churn of franchise personnel will ever allow for a sustainable plan.         In San Antonio after drafting Duncan the Spurs never had the luxury of luring big-name stars or great draft position to find complementary talent. But they were one of the prescient teams to mine the early international market landing Tony Parker with the last pick of the first round in 2001 after stealing Manu Ginobili with the 57th (second-round) pick in 1999.         Reacting to global expansion with more provincial hick than urban slick the Knicks only in recent years began earnestly pursuing foreign-born talent.         There is no news media onslaught in San Antonio as there is in New York but the Spurs have been patient with their young players from Parker a decade ago to Kawhi Leonard now.         Under pressure from an impatient public  but also from Dolans dictums and ever-rising ticket prices  the Knicks invariably dwell more on the inadequacies of a promising talent like Iman Shumpert.         Walsh made the call on signing Amare Stoudemire and his fragile knees before jettisoning David Lee but it can be argued that the franchise instability and style-over-substance ethos made that risky and now-ruinous move inevitable.         It is well known around the league that Popovich demands a certain kind of player or at least players with the ability to assimilate into his team-first system. At the Garden Dolan has welcomed too many heralded saviors turned saboteurs.         San Antonios owner Peter Holt is seldom talked about. In New York Dolan is a continuing topic of bewildering and derogatory conversation. And that is not good no matter the context.                Also in Video »       
283,100000002540484,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,,They Loved Your G.P.A. Then They Saw Your Tweets.,NATASHA SINGER,1267,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/business/they-loved-your-gpa-then-they-saw-your-tweets.html,3,At Bowdoin College in Brunswick Me. admissions officers are still talking about the high school senior who attended a campus information session last year for prospective students. Throughout the presentation she apparently posted disparaging comments on Twitter about her fellow attendees repeatedly using a common expletive.         Perhaps she hadnt realized that colleges keep track of their social media mentions.         It was incredibly unusual and foolish of her to do that  Scott A. Meiklejohn Bowdoins dean of admissions  and financial aid told me last week. The college ultimately denied the student admission he said because her academic record wasnt competitive. But had her credentials been better those indiscreet posts could have scuttled her chances.         We would have wondered about the judgment of someone who spends their time on their mobile phone and makes such awful remarks Mr. Meiklejohn said.         As certain high school seniors work meticulously this month to finish their early applications to colleges some may not realize that comments they casually make online could negatively affect their prospects. In fact new  research from Kaplan Test Prep  the service owned by the Washington Post Company suggests that online scrutiny of college hopefuls is growing.         Of 381 college admissions officers who answered a Kaplan telephone questionnaire this year 31 percent said they had visited an applicants Facebook or other personal social media page to learn more about them  a five-percentage-point increase from last year. More crucially for those trying to get into college 30 percent of the admissions officers said they had discovered information online that had negatively affected an applicants prospects.         Students social media and digital footprint can sometimes play a role in the admissions process says Christine Brown the executive director of K-12 and college prep programs at Kaplan Test Prep. Its something that is becoming more ubiquitous and less looked down upon.         In the business realm employers now vet the online reputations of job candidates as a matter of course. Given the impulsiveness of typical teenagers however  not to mention the already fraught nature of college acceptances and rejections  the idea that admissions officers would covertly nose around the social media posts of prospective students seems more chilling.         There is some reason for concern. Ms. Brown says that most colleges dont have formal policies about admissions officers supplementing students files with their own online research. If colleges find seemingly troubling material online they may not necessarily notify the applicants involved.         To me its a huge problem said  Bradley S. Shear a lawyer specializing in social media  law. For one thing Mr. Shear told me colleges might erroneously identify the account of a person with the same name as a prospective student  or even mistake an impostors account  as belonging to the applicant potentially leading to unfair treatment. Often he added false and misleading content online is taken as fact.         These kinds of concerns prompted me last week to email 20 colleges and universities  small and large private and public East Coast and West Coast  to ask about their practices. Then I called admissions officials at 10 schools who agreed to interviews.         Each official told me that it was not routine practice at his or her institution for admissions officers to use Google searches on applicants or to peruse their social media posts. Most said their school received so many applications to review  with essays recommendations and often supplemental portfolios  that staff members wouldnt be able to do extra research online. A few also felt that online investigations might lead to unfair or inconsistent treatment.         As students use of social media is growing theres a whole variety of ways that college admissions officers can use it  Beth A. Wiser the director of admissions  at the University of Vermont told me. We have chosen to not use it as part of the process in making admissions decisions.         Other admissions officials said they did not formally prohibit the practice. In fact they said admissions officers did look at online material about applicants on an ad hoc basis. Sometimes prospective students themselves ask an admissions office to look at blogs or videos they have posted; on other occasions an admissions official might look up an obscure award or event mentioned by an applicant for purposes of elucidation.         Last year we watched some animation videos and we followed media stories about an applicant who was involved in a political cause says Will Hummel an admissions officer at  Pomona College in Claremont  Calif. But those were rare instances he says and the supplemental material didnt significantly affect the students admissions prospects.        
284,100000002543777,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,football,N.F.L. Coaches: In Charge and at Risk,BEN SHPIGEL,1360,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/sports/football/nfl-coaches-in-charge-and-at-risk.html,1,The day before he had emergency quadruple-bypass surgery in 1998 Dan Reeves relayed his symptoms  accelerated burning sensations in his chest and throat  and asked his doctor if a checkup could wait until after the N.F.L. season.         The doctor responded by telling Reeves who eight years earlier had a procedure to remove arterial blockages that it was the dumbest request he had ever heard.         I was in denial  Reeves  said.         Reeves then 54 had a team to coach and so he did. He was on the sideline for the Atlanta Falcons that December afternoon in New Orleans but did not return for four weeks as he recovered from open-heart surgery. His determination to keep going to ignore his well-being is common in the demanding world of coaching a profession stocked with Type A personalities who solve problems by working harder working longer working more. Among them are John Fox of the Denver Broncos and Gary Kubiak of the Houston Texans whose health scares on consecutive days last weekend cast into sharp relief the stresses associated with their jobs.          Fox  58 complained of dizziness Nov. 2 at a golf course in North Carolina and moved up the aortic valve-replacement surgery he was to have after the season. Kubiak 52 dropped to his knees while walking off the field at halftime of Sundays game against Indianapolis and was found to have had a transient ischemic attack or a ministroke.         The day after Kubiak fell ill Brian Billick the former Baltimore Ravens coach received a text message from one of his daughters.         Dad it read promise me you wont ever go back to coaching.         Billick paces himself better in his job as an analyst for Fox Sports and NFL Network but Kubiak and Fox may not have that option. They are expected to recover though it is unclear when they will rejoin their teams.         Dr. Douglas Johnston a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic who had no direct knowledge of Foxs case said that patients could usually resume functioning at 99 percent capacity within six weeks of an aortic valve replacement and that he would expect Fox to return with no limitations and more energy because his heart would be operating more efficiently.         Dr. Shazam Hussain the head of Cleveland Clinics stroke program speaking generally offered a sanguine outlook for Kubiak but said that a transient ischemic attack could be a warning sign before a major stroke and that he urged his patients to exercise and to limit their intake of salt and fat.         Reeves said he had a transient ischemic attack two days after leaving the hospital following the quadruple bypass. He woke up in the emergency room and asked a nurse to turn on the television for the Falcons game in Detroit. Reeves said he could relate to Fox and Kubiak for reasons beyond the stress.         Foxs Broncos are zipping toward the playoffs just as the Falcons were in December 1998 when Reeves wanted to be part of every moment. Reeves empathizes with his former quarterback Kubiak whose Texans have lost their last six games because he remembers how hard he worked in 1994 when his Giants lost seven straight.         Believe me youre working extra thinking Gosh Ive got to do something; what can I do? Reeves said. The answer is you do whatever you can.         The popular image of a football coach is also a romanticized one of valor in sleeping at team headquarters or logging 18-hour workdays. A badge of courage the former Giants coach Jim Fassel called it.         That message is propagated by fans the news media and even the teams themselves who applaud the bleary-eyed men who watch one more clip and diagram one more play all for the greater good of the team. No one brags about working less or sleeping more about being the fifth coach to arrive every morning and not the first.         A lot of the guys just think that theres not another way that thats how you do it period said Rich Brooks who was plagued by ulcers and other stomach ailments at the beginning of his 18-year coaching tenure at the University of Oregon. Nobodys had the guts to cut the workdays short or to do it different.         Brooks the Falcons defensive coordinator in 1998 filled in for Reeves during his absence.

Former President Mohamed Nasheed won the most votes in the presidential election on Saturday around 47 percent  a commanding lead over his closest rival but not enough to avoid a runoff. However after receiving petitions requesting a delay the Supreme Court ordered the Sunday vote suspended recommending that it be held next weekend said Hamid Abdul Ghafoor an official in Mr. Nasheeds party.         It was the third time an election had been delayed by a court order and was evidence of continuing turmoil in this fragile democracy which elected its first president five years ago after 30 years of autocratic rule. Among Mr. Nasheeds rivals are candidates tied to the countrys longtime leader Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and important factions in the government remain loyal to the former government.         Mr. Ghafoor described the atmosphere on Sunday as one of eerie calm and said the vote would probably not take place.         The people are confused he said in a telephone interview. Nobody knows what is going on except that there are these benchmarks we can see for ourselves. Now we are in limbo. Some people think voting should go on at 11 a.m. as scheduled.         The courts order said that all relevant state authorities are informed that todays election cannot take place and that a runoff just one day after an election could undermine peoples constitutional rights reported The Press Trust of India a news service. The order recommended delaying the runoff until next Saturday         Mr. Nasheeds supporters and many international players protested the delay. Earlier Saturday a State Department spokeswoman in Washington said it was now imperative that the second round take place immediately and in line with elections commission directions in order to ensure the Maldivian people are led by an elected president of their choice.         The spokeswoman Jen Psaki said it was unreasonable and unacceptable for parties to continue to demand changes to an agreed election date and warned that it would lead to instability. Changing the goal posts is unfair to Maldivian voters she said.         In second place in Saturdays election with 30 percent of the vote was Yaamin Abdul Gayoom the brother of Maumoon Abdul Gayoom the countrys longtime autocratic leader.         Mr. Nasheeds party the Maldivian Democratic Party reported that the vote had proceeded smoothly without major incident and urged that the will of the people be respected.         Mr. Nasheed  resigned last year  in what he described as a coup. In the first presidential election in September Mr. Nasheed  received by far the largest share of votes  45 percent but the Supreme Court annulled those results after one of the losing candidates said there were electoral violations. A second election last month was  halted when police officers surrounded the election commissions offices in Male  saying they had received a court order not allow it to proceed because some candidates had not approved voter rolls.         Various countries  among them Britain India and the United States  issued strong statements before the latest election saying they expected a transparent and free process. Navi Pillay the United Nations high commissioner for human rights said the countrys Supreme Court was interfering excessively and in doing so is subverting the right of Maldivians to freely elect their representatives.         R. K. Radhakrishnan a journalist who has covered Maldives extensively said none of the outside actors appeared ready to take an active role in the conflict  something that may be necessary to break the deadlock between the two main factions in Male. Elites he said are resisting a transfer of power because Mr. Nasheed has threatened to jail them. He said further rounds of voting were pointless unless the two factions negotiated.         They are not willing to talk to each other because no one in the international community is taking the time to make them talk said Mr. Radhakrishnan a senior editor at The Hindu.

287,100000002543965,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,,"Transition Begins in Boston, for First Time in a Generation",KATHARINE Q. SEELYE,1082,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/us/transition-begins-in-boston-for-first-time-in-a-generation.html,22,BOSTON  With the election last week of Martin J. Walsh as mayor Boston is poised to break out of the mold cast by Mayor Thomas M. Menino who has thoroughly dominated the city and its government during his 20-year tenure the longest in the citys history.         Mr. Menino who did not seek re-election because of health issues is widely credited with transforming Boston from something of a backwater into a world-class city with a gleaming new seaport and innovation district.         Still the city seems animated at the prospect of change. With deference to Mr. Menino who retains sky-high approval ratings Mr. Walsh 46 a state legislator and union leader promises a new era in both style and substance even before he takes the oath of office on Jan. 6.         As part of his transition process Mr. Walsh is planning town hall-style meetings starting later this month to listen to peoples concerns. In the glow of his election victory he has promised transparency in government and open access to the news media. He told reporters on Friday to call him Marty.         He campaigned on broad themes of equality improving the public schools and making neighborhoods safer or in his words free from gun violence. He said that half his cabinet would be made up of minorities. And he has promised to dismantle the Boston Redevelopment Authority the agency that oversees construction in the city and through which Mr. Menino controlled which developers got a green light.         In naming part of his transition team Friday Mr. Walsh sent an immediate signal that his administration would be inclusive. The team included three former mayoral candidates  Charlotte Golar-Richie and John Barros who are black and Felix Arroyo who is Hispanic. The three had endorsed him early and their tireless campaigning was crucial to his win.         The city is vibrant financially healthy and growing but for all of its progress it faces at least two major challenges that could stem its growth: the poor quality of the schools and the lack of affordable housing.         Voters said education was their biggest concern. Mr. Walsh has said his top priority would be naming a new school superintendent before the school year begins in September with the goal of closing the achievement gap between low-performing and high-achieving students. A co-founder of a  charter school  he also wants more of them.         Having a pro-charter-school mayor could be a game-changer said Paul S. Grogan the president of the Boston Foundation which provides grants to nonprofit organizations and is a leader in civic life. We have the strongest charter schools in the country and if any city has an opportunity to deliver broad academic gains for students its Boston.         The city is attracting more graduate students medical residents young professionals and empty nesters but the fastest growing demographic is young families with children. Because of the schools though they are hard to retain.         In addition housing is limited. The new arrivals are competing with middle- and lower-income families for the older existing housing stock said Barry Bluestone the director of the Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy at Northeastern University. The prices of triple-deckers are going through the roof now he said and longtime residents are being priced out of the market.         Rents he said are the third highest in the country after New York and San Francisco. And housing prices in parts of the city are astronomical: the median price of a single-family home in downtown Boston including the South End the Back Bay and Beacon Hill is now $2.1 million according to the Warren Group; a year ago it was $1.8 million.         Its not too difficult to build housing for millionaires or for poor people Mr. Bluestone said noting that government programs help the very poor. But what we cant produce is affordable housing for working families.         Mr. Menino has proposed spending $16 billion in private and public money to build 30000 housing units by 2020 but it is not clear whether Mr. Walsh will back that proposal.         As for public safety Boston has a relatively low crime rate. Mr. Walsh will be naming a police chief and has vowed to hire more minorities and women as police officers so that the department more closely reflects the city population which is now 53 percent Latino black and Asian.         Mr. Walsh also said he would judge his success in reducing crime not by statistics but by how the community feels.                Also in Video »       
288,100000002543734,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,baseball,"Mets’ Alderson Can Finally Spend, Assuming He Wants To",TIM ROHAN,914,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/sports/baseball/mets-alderson-can-finally-spend-assuming-he-wants-to.html,9,For three years  Mets  General Manager  Sandy Alderson  has tried building a roster on a limited budget. At a clear disadvantage he faced small expectations as if batting with one hand tied behind his back and staring at Matt Harvey on the mound. He had to take a few weak swings and hope for the best until more money came off the books.         Now the Mets swear they can spend again. Alderson could have about $35 million and a blank slate as he attends the general managers meetings this week in Orlando Fla. Only David Wright Jon Niese Dillon Gee and Zack Wheeler appear to be guaranteed roster spots. The other 21 should be up to Alderson.         That of course also means that Alderson has a lot of holes to fill. He has said he wants to find a corner outfielder a shortstop maybe a pitcher. There is a logjam at first base that must play out. The Mets spare parts could be traded. Alderson might finally be able to take a healthy swing. But it would be a bigger letdown now if he misses.         Last season like the two before he was forced to scan the bargain bin for aging veterans most of whom carried some risk. With uncertain finances the Mets payroll had dropped by about $50 million during his tenure. He signed about a dozen veterans to minor league deals. All of them eventually played a role with the team.         To Aldersons credit he has unearthed a few gems over the last three years.         Marlon Byrd was one of the dozen. He was suspended 50 games in 2012 for testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug but he batted in the middle of the Mets order last season hitting 21 homers and driving in 71 runs. He played so well that he was packaged in a late-season trade that returned Dilson Herrera a young shortstop prospect and Vic Black a promising young reliever.         The season before Alderson brought back Scott Hairston on his second one-year deal worth about $1.1 million. Hairston hit 20 home runs a career high good for third most on the team and parlayed that into a two-year deal with the Chicago Cubs.         The season before Alderson took a chance on Chris Capuano who had had two Tommy John elbow operations and made nine starts in three years. Alderson signed him to a one-year deal worth about $1.5 million. Capuano made 31 starts finished tied for second on the team with 11 victories and then signed a two-year deal worth about $10 million with the Los Angeles Dodgers.         This was the cyclical nature of free agency: Players given the chance would prove their worth and play themselves out of the Mets price range.         The best most rewarding moves have resulted from Aldersons shopping two attractive trade chips and being in a position of power. For trading Carlos Beltran he got Wheeler. For trading R. A. Dickey and a few parts he got another potential front-line starter (Noah Syndergaard) a catcher for the future (Travis dArnaud) another prospect (Wuilmer Becerra) and a veteran catcher (John Buck). Buck hit 15 home runs last season before being traded with Byrd.         The Mets could make another trade this off-season if perhaps Alderson is bold enough to move his star prospects. Ike Davis Lucas Duda or Daniel Murphy could also be dealt. They were not among the four  Wright Niese Gee and Wheeler  reportedly deemed safe by Jeff Wilpon the teams chief operating officer.         Mets fans can at least dream about prying Brandon Phillips from Cincinnati Carlos Gonzalez or Troy Tulowitzki from Colorado or David Price from Tampa Bay.         Making a trade may be wiser. The players at the top of the free-agent market those who could make a difference for the Mets  Robinson Cano Jacoby Ellsbury Shin-Soo Choo  are probably out of their price range. Ellsbury or Choo would fit nicely atop the Mets lineup but both are flawed. Choo struggles against left-handed pitching and Ellsbury is injury prone.         Still both should command contracts in excess of $100 million.         Alderson has said that the Mets would spend substantial money for the right player. But it seems unlikely given the number of areas he needs to address. There is a better chance he will go bargain shopping again just in a higher-end aisle.         For a shortstop Jhonny Peralta may have been suspended as part of the Biogenesis scandal but he hit .333 in the playoffs for Detroit upon his return. Also Stephen Drew could be a pricey fit after having a nice season for the champion Boston Red Sox.         For outfielders Beltran and Curtis Granderson are intriguing options. But Beltran will turn 37 in April and Granderson is coming off an injury-riddled season.         Adding Corey Hart of the Milwaukee Brewers a first baseman/outfielder would bring power. He missed all of last season with injuries to his knees but averaged 29 home runs his three previous seasons.         Then there is always the possibility Alderson will stand pat. Maybe he will decide a trade would cost too much and no free agent is worth an expensive multiyear deal. Perhaps he will add a player or two bide his time and save money until Harvey recovers from Tommy John surgery and the team is ready to contend.         The Mets have endured three losing seasons under Alderson though waiting for this moment waiting to go for it. Waiting some more would take exceptional patience.

Coaches and players point to a more determined effort over all an increasingly stout run defense and the acquisition of Jon Beason in assessing the teams longest stretch at keeping opponents without an offensive touchdown since a stretch of 15 quarters from Oct. 23 to Nov. 20 in 2005.         They neglect to note though that the Giants benefited from woeful play by opposing quarterbacks in the last two games both victories: 23-7 against the Minnesota Vikings and 15-7 against the Philadelphia Eagles. That created a flicker of hope in the N.F.C. East for the 2-6 Giants who face another uncertain young passer the Raiders Terrelle Pryor.         Minnesotas only score came on a punt return as the once-promising Josh Freeman looking to restart his career after the Tampa Bay Buccaneers dumped him made a forgettable Vikings debut two weeks after he joined the team. Freemans passes landed here there and everywhere as he converted only 37.7 percent going 20 of 53 for 190 yards with an interception.         Philadelphia managed its only points on a fumble recovery after a high punt snap. Michael Vick apparently not recovered from a strained hamstring was forced into service at quarterback because his replacement Nick Foles was sidelined with a concussion. Vick threw for only 30 yards with an interception before he limped back to the bench after aggravating his injury. Matt Barkley a rookie from Southern California avoided a repeat of his three-interception fourth quarter in the Eagles loss to the Dallas Cowboys the week before. But that was the best that could be said for him after a mundane 17-for-26 outing for 158 yards with one interception.         As much as the stark defensive improvement stems from a variety of factors coaches and players are quick to seize on it in a season that has had few positive elements.         We are contesting better and were getting turnovers so were denying opportunities and were playing better Coach Tom Coughlin said. Were playing harder. Were more synchronized. I hope it just does nothing but get better.         According to Mathias Kiwanuka a veteran defensive end members of the unit rededicated themselves by staying later to watch film after an  0-6 start  in which every phase of the Giants game broke down at one time or another.         When everybody decided enough was enough and wed get the stops thats what happened Kiwanuka said.         There is every indication that the most critical change was adding  Beason  on Oct. 4 from the Carolina Panthers for a late-round draft choice. Beason a middle linebacker in his seventh season already has 25 tackles 18 unassisted. Perhaps more important he immediately became a take-charge figure in the huddle.         Having Jon Beason here at middle linebacker has definitely helped a lot said Antrel Rolle a veteran safety and another defensive leader. Hes cleared up a lot of gray area. Hes the voice of the defense. Were rallying behind him and taking our assignments from him.         During the Giants worst start since they lost nine in a row to begin the 1976 season players often blamed poor communication for breakdowns in coverage that resulted in long gains. According to Rolle Beason quickly processes instructions relayed from the sidelines and relays them clearly. If other adjustments must be made at the line of scrimmage he is adept at that.         The Giants run defense was exceptional the last two games. Adrian Peterson widely regarded as the leagues premier back could not muster enough of a threat to ease the pressure on Freeman. He carried 13 times for only 28 yards 2 fewer than the Vikings total. The Giants held Philadelphia to 48 rushing yards.         On Friday Darren McFadden Oaklands talented but injury-plagued back was ruled out of Sundays game after he was unable to practice with an injured hamstring. That should allow the Giants to focus on Pryor who is 6 feet 4 inches and 233 pounds.         Hes a 4.4 guy built like a power forward on a basketball team and he can go Perry Fewell the Giants defensive coordinator said referring to Pryors speed in the 40. Were going to have our A game going in to contain this guy because he can hurt you.         The Raiders took Pryor in the third round of the 2011 supplemental draft after he withdrew from Ohio State amid allegations that he received improper benefits. He leads all quarterbacks with 485 rushing yards including a 93-yard scamper in a 21-18 victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Oct. 27 the longest by a quarterback in league history.         He is still finding his way as a passer completing 121 of 198 attempts for 1437 yards. He has almost twice as many interceptions (nine) as touchdown passes (five). He threw for a career-high 288 yards and ran for 94 in Oaklands 49-20 loss to the Eagles last Sunday in a game in which his counterpart Foles tied an N.F.L. record by throwing for seven touchdowns.         The Raiders amassed 560 yards against Philadelphia the third highest in franchise history suggesting the Giants may find it hard to keep them without an offensive touchdown and extend their streak.        
290,100000002544024,0,Article,Series,World,world,asia,Reporter for Reuters Won’t Receive China Visa,ANDREW JACOBS,709,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/world/asia/reporter-for-reuters-wont-receive-china-visa.html,20,BEIJING  The Chinese government has rejected the visa application of a veteran American journalist who had been waiting eight months to begin a new reporting job in  China  for Thomson Reuters the company said.         The reporter Paul Mooney said the Chinese Foreign Ministry told Reuters on Friday that it would not grant him a resident journalist visa but declined to provide a reason. Mr. Mooney returned to the United States last year after the expiration of his previous visa which was sponsored by The South China Morning Post a newspaper based in Hong Kong.         The rejection comes at a time of rising tensions between foreign news organizations and the government which has been using its economic clout the issuance of visas and Internet controls to express displeasure with coverage it deems unflattering.         China has been my career Mr. Mooney who has spent three decades covering Asia the last 18 years based in Beijing said Saturday in a phone interview. I never thought it was going to end this way. Im sad and disappointed.         The websites for Bloomberg News and The New York Times have been blocked in China for more than a year following the publication of investigative articles by both news organizations that  detailed the wealth accumulated by relatives  of  top Chinese leaders . Since then employees for both Bloomberg and The Times have been awaiting residency visas that would allow them to report from China.         Such tactics appear to have had an impact. On Saturday  The Times detailed a decision late last month  by Bloomberg to withhold publication of an investigative report more than a year in the works that explored hidden financial ties between one of Chinas wealthiest men and the families of senior Chinese leaders. Company employees said the editor in chief Matthew Winkler defended the decision by comparing it to the self-censorship by foreign news bureaus that sought to remain working inside Nazi Germany.         Mr. Winkler and a senior editor denied that the articles had been killed and said they would eventually be published.         The Chinese governments rejection of Mr. Mooneys visa request will certainly add to the anxieties of foreign reporters in China many of whom complain of cyberattacks police interference and intimidation especially during the annual visa renewal process currently underway which sometimes involves interviews with Foreign Ministry officials or public security personnel.         In a statement the Foreign Correspondents Club of China said Such delays and lack of transparency merely add to the impression that the visa process is being used by the authorities to intimidate journalists and media organizations.         Last year Al Jazeera English shut its Beijing bureau after the authorities  refused to renew press credentials  and the visa of its China correspondent Melissa Chan. Although they did not explain the reasons behind Ms. Chans expulsion the first from China in 14 years it was widely seen as retaliation for her hard-hitting coverage of Chinese society.         An American currently based in San Francisco Ms. Chan said the Chinese governments recent efforts to bully some of the largest foreign news organizations would have an insidious trickle-down effect on smaller media outlets especially those from Southeast Asia and Africa that cannot afford to lose what may be their sole correspondent in China. Its got to have a chilling effect that leads to some level of self-censorship she said in a phone interview on Saturday.         Mr. Mooney said he suspected that the governments decision to deny him a visa was punishment for his persistent coverage of human rights abuses in China. In April after submitting his visa application to the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco he was summoned for an interview where he was questioned about previous articles and asked to explain his position on delicate issues like Tibet. The interview ended with a barely veiled threat. They said If we give you a visa we hope youll be more balanced with your coverage  he said he was told.         Mr. Mooney 63 now living in Berkeley Calif. said Reuters told him that it would not continue pressing China over the issue.         Barb Burg a spokeswoman for Reuters in New York said We are in the process of considering other posts for Paul within Reuters. Calls to the Foreign Ministry in Beijing went unanswered.

What I found was totally different.         At 106th Street and Fifth Avenue more than 2 hours 30 minutes after the last of the runners started I witnessed an endless wave of people. From there the path that my wife my son and I took often put us inches from those who were straining to finish. We traveled with a backpack and walking poles yet apart from the security line that we had to pass through to view the last quarter-mile of the race we were left to enjoy the day without interference.         There was unfettered intimacy in this experience. I was happily surprised that this felt much like what I imagined the marathon route was in the days before the Boston bombings.         ROBERT S. NUSSBAUM         Fort Lee N.J.         ¢         To the Sports Editor:         The marathon finish line and family reunion areas used to be confined to Central Park. Central Park West was open to traffic all day and parking was restricted for only five or six blocks.         But this year I had to tell my 9-year-old that she could not go to her friends apartment because it was within the frozen zone in the West 60s. Security at any price has become the new mantra. Residential neighborhoods have become police states for the marathon.         The race needs to be scaled back so it does not disrupt city residents lives any more than necessary. That means moving the family reunion area back inside the park and reducing the number of entrants below 30000.         BETH GANNON         New York         ¢         To the Sports Editor:         In the front-page photograph that accompanied this article the deteriorating rusty wall of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is as plain as day as it was on the television broadcast that reached viewers around the world. The grandeur of the diverse multitudes crossing the magnificent bridge was marred by this eyesore.         It is curious that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority cannot find the money to maintain this bridge even though the cash toll is $15.         EDWARD GUERRERA         Miller Place N.Y.         ¢         To the Sports Editor:         After I completed the New York City Marathon on Sunday I waited for my fiancÃ©e in the family reunion area for two hours in the cold with nothing more than a foil blanket and my running kit for warmth.         Fortunately for me a kind New Yorker was also waiting for her husband. She secured additional blankets for me and gave me her hat and gloves to wear. When she left she insisted that I keep them. I never found my fiancÃ©e so I walked back to my hotel.         I want to thank the woman who helped me but I do not know her name.

There is a strip club a budget motel with weekly rates and on the gentrified edge of this no-mans land the offices of  Medium  the new venture of Evan Williams one of Twitters co-founders.         Mr. Williams is a contemplative 41-year-old Nebraskan turned billionaire at least on paper as of Thursday when Twitter went public. If Twitter redefined the frontier of communications Medium is trying to reclaim some of the lost territory.         Broadly speaking Medium is a blogging platform meaning its a place for people to write and read posts. And Mr. Williams as its C.E.O. hopes that it will allow thoughtful longer-form writing to flourish. Mr. Williams frankly acknowledges that the medium of Medium is not new. In fact he says hes reaching back to the once-du jour notion of blogging because in the frenzy to build social communications tools something has been left behind: rationality.         In the early days I bought into the idea that the Internet would lead to a better world that the truth was out there and that we didnt need gatekeepers he said. The idea that he and many others embraced was that an unfiltered Internet would create a democratic information utopia. Now he continued I think its more complicated than that.         Medium is Mr. Williamss version of a gatekeeper albeit one that relies heavily on technology rather than human expertise or taste. While it has some editors soliciting and promoting some content the bigger idea is to use algorithms to help identify blog posts that readers consider valuable and to bubble them to the surface.         Hes carrying out ideas he toyed with in his first big commercial venture which was called simply Blogger. He sold that to Google a decade ago begetting his first millions. Now he is joining the mini-movement to celebrate long-form expression at sites and apps like Longform Longreads and the Verge. The oddity is that Mr. Williams helped found Twitter which is to long form what snacks are to dinner: sometimes a prelude often an appetite killer.         The short-burst culture has eaten away at the very definition of long form. Many articles in Medium for instance are hundreds of characters longer than a tweet but tens of thousands fewer than something youd find in say The New Yorker.         And some see little evidence that people want to consume anything that takes much time. I see a diminishing audience for long form of anything said  James Katz  director of the division of emerging media studies at Boston University. The riptide of society is heading the other direction.         For his part Mr. Williams said he was disturbed by the swelling cacophony of information that makes it easy to be overwhelmed and hard to know what to trust. Good information he said can lose out and as he described his new mission I want to give rationality a fighting chance.         Im an eternal optimist Mr. Williams told me over lunch last week wearing skinny jeans and long-sleeve black T-shirt. But Im a more realistic optimist than I used to be.         He traced the evolution of his thinking by describing an epiphany that bothered him this year. In preparing a speech he revisited his careers early days. The exercise made him realize that the Internet wasnt changing the world as he had once idealized but that far less romantically it had come to be little more than a convenience.         If this sort of revelation rationalizes Mr. Williamss new business he is not alone in believing it. Nor is he the only mogul seeking to use a technology-borne fortune to finance serious journalism. (See: Jeff Bezos buys The Washington Post or Pierre Omidyar finances Glenn Greenwald in an investigative journalism venture.)         But you have to give credit to Mr. Williams for having the courage of his convictions. Hes been doing his own thing since he embraced his inner nerd rejected the football-obsessed culture of his native Nebraska (becoming a vegan there he said was tough) and moved west. He can also afford to do what he wants given that his already considerable net worth has jumped nearly $2.5 billion owing to his 10.4 percent stake in Twitter.         Hes backing Medium along with two business partners Biz Stone and Jason Goldman both formerly of Twitter. Medium which started in 2012 has around 40 employees and last month started letting anyone write for it. A few writers are paid with their work solicited by a small editing team but most are not. Much ballyhooed by Medium is software that allows collaboration among writers by letting them share posts privately before publication in pursuit of suggestions or edits. Posts then appear in collections or channels like  Adventures in Consumer Technology  or  Best Thing I Found Online Today .        
293,100000002543921,0,Article,News,World,world,,Talks With Iran Fail to Produce a Nuclear Agreement,MARK LANDLER;MICHAEL R. GORDON,1432,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/world/iran-nuclear-talks.html,1,GENEVA  Marathon talks between major powers and Iran failed on Sunday to produce a deal to freeze its nuclear program puncturing days of feverish anticipation and underscoring how hard it will be to forge a lasting solution to Irans nuclear ambitions.         Emerging from a last-ditch bargaining session that began Saturday and stretched past midnight the European Unions foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and Irans foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said they had failed to overcome differences. They insisted they had made progress however and pledged to return to the table in 10 days to try again albeit at a lower level.         A lot of concrete progress has been made but some differences remain Ms. Ashton said at a news conference early Sunday. She appeared alongside Mr. Zarif who added I think it was natural that when we started dealing with the details there would be differences.         In the end though it was not only divisions between Iran and the major powers that prevented a deal but fissures within the negotiating group. France objected strenuously that the proposed deal would do too little to curb Irans uranium enrichment or to stop the development of a nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium.         The Geneva meeting allowed us to advance but we were not able to conclude because there are still some questions to be addressed the French foreign minister Laurent Fabius told reporters after the talks ended.         Neither Ms. Ashton nor Mr. Zarif criticized France saying that it had played a constructive role. But the disappointment was palpable and the decision to hold the next meeting at the level of political director not foreign minister suggested that the two sides were less confident of their ability to bridge the gaps in the next round.         For all that Mr. Zarif tried to put a brave face on the three days of talks saying that the atmosphere had been good even if the parties disagreed on the details of a potential agreement.         What I was looking for was the political determination willingness and good faith in order to end this he said. I think were all on the same wavelength and thats important.         Iranian officials had promoted the possibility of a deal for days generating an expectant atmosphere that swelled when Secretary of State John Kerry cut short a tour of the Middle East on Friday to join the talks. He was joined by the foreign ministers of Britain France Germany and Russia and a vice foreign minister from China.         Theres no question in my mind that we are closer now as we leave Geneva than when we came Mr. Kerry said. It takes time to build confidence between countries that have really been at odds with each other for a long time now.         The proposal under consideration in Geneva was to have been the first stage of a multipart agreement. It called for Iran to freeze its nuclear program for up to six months to allow negotiations on a long-term agreement without the worry that Iran was racing ahead to build a bomb. In exchange the West was to have provided some easing of the international sanctions that have battered Irans economy.         After years of off-again on-again talks the deal would have been the first to brake Irans nuclear program.Despite the diplomats insistence on progress the failure to clinch an agreement raised questions about the future of the nuclear talks given the fierce criticism that the mere prospect of a deal whipped up in Israel and among Republicans and some Democrats in Congress.         The announcement was a deflating end to a long day of diplomatic twists and turns after Mr. Kerry huddled for hours with Mr. Zarif and Mr. Fabius to try to close gaps on issues like curbing Irans enrichment program and what to do about the heavy-water reactor Iran is building near the city of Arak which will produce plutonium.

294,100000002539056,0,Article,News,Booming,booming,,The Sex Toys in the Attic,JOYCE WADLER,1037,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/booming/the-sex-toys-in-the-attic.html,,Ive been thinking about an extremely beautiful sex toy an old boyfriend got me  I think it is on my mind because he is having heart surgery this week. This is how it is at a certain age; when you hear about an old boyfriend its not because he got married or got a great job it is because theyre threading tubes into his chest and doing an ablation on his heart.         This toy which was silver and shaped like a stylized banana was so complicated I never used it. Also you had to charge it for a few hours. It wasnt one of those things that charged with a discreet little light either; it blasted O-shaped strobe signals across a darkened room that could have been used to direct incoming flights at a small airport ideally one catering to businessmen whose wives had lost interest in sex years ago. Well thats what they all say isnt it?         As I have a personal code that says you do not use a sex toy given to you by one man with another (yes I do have a Puritan streak) and disliking it anyway I had stashed this thing in a big closet which is like deep space things go there and disappear forever. The other day I heard Sandra Bullock in there hollering.         But now with the old beaus surgery looming the toy  rather its disposal  was on my mind. This was a problem. It was not one of those unused household items you can donate to Housing Works; they dont even take sheets. Im an environmentally conscious person but I couldnt see taking it to old electronics day at Union Square. I could put it into the appropriate recycling bin on my floor but then the neighbors might figure it out: Its her. All day all night I hear buzzing coming out of that apartment. No wonder shes always smiling. I might try to dispose of it with the kitchen garbage hiding it with coffee grounds and dead things from the back of the refrigerator as I do old tax reports but then Id be in violation of the recycling law.         I know I know  I should have been one of those women who held out for diamonds.         But disposing of sex paraphernalia  actually all those embarrassing items you have stashed around the house  is something every boomer should be concerned about. The days are dwindling down to a precious few and some of you have a nasty cough. Do you want the people clearing out your house particularly your children to find those feathery metallic rubbery polymer blend items you ordered one drunken night a few months after youd been forced to take early retirement? Do you want them to know their big tough construction worker dad liked to dress up in heels and a boa and sing La La La from No Strings one of Richard Rodgerss weaker efforts?         You may be thinking What do I care what my friends or children find in the house? I will be beyond embarrassment I will be dead. But you are wrong. Doctors now know that the human sense of embarrassment can last up to two weeks after the heart stops beating. Consider this statement from a boomer named Stanley: I was lying on the operating table then I had a feeling of leaving my body and looking down at myself and all I could think was Is my gut really that big?  Look it up on the web.         I know no one likes to think about death. But just as the responsible person designates someone to make medical decisions in case he or she is incapacitated we should all have designated lets call them Eradicators to come over and clean the house after we expire. Remember Marilyn Monroe. Not that I can prove anything just saying. Your Eradicator should be given house keys a list of items to be destroyed and their hiding places  you dont want to be in intensive care screaming Back of the sock drawer! Theyll just increase your meds.         The truly considerate person will dispose of potentially humiliating or harmful items the moment he gets really sick like a married man I knew who gave his love letters from the other woman to a male friend before he went into the hospital. Then he got better and got the love letters back. Then he died which was a big mistake on his part though I hear it made for an interesting moment at the memorial when the widow spotted the other woman. Think of this as a cautionary tale. Horrible things can happen when you leave romantic mementos around the house.         There is no excuse however for careless or improper disposal such as my friend Herb and I were witness to many years ago in Greenwich Village when we spied a sex toy in the street  not on the sidewalk in the street. Id tell you what it was but I am trying to stay within newspaper guidelines: O.K. think adult seesaw.         Herb and I gaped long and hard at this thing first debating the anatomical possibilities (and you wonder what friends have to talk about after 40 years) then as in Law & Order trying to recreate the scene:         Had there been a lovers quarrel during which this humongous shillelagh had been tossed out of a cab? If that was the case why did the couple have the thing in the cab in the first place  stealing a kiss in the back seat is one thing but that? Had it slipped out of someones shopping bag and then even in the Village was he or she too embarrassed to pick it up?         Awful right? And imagine how much worse it would have been if it had been spotted when I was walking with a child.         Whats that thing in the street Auntie Joyce?         Its a grown-up thing sweetie. People buy them when they love each other very much. Or maybe not enough. One day when youre grown up a man will fall in love with you. When that happens bring up diamonds.         Joyce Wadler is the author of Cured: My Ovarian Cancer Story. Â Follow Joyce Wadler on Facebook:  facebook.com/joyce.wadler  and on Twitter:  @joyce_wadler.

295,100000002543789,0,Article,News,World,world,asia,Philippine Typhoon Death Toll Feared in Thousands,FLOYD WHALEY,757,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/world/asia/philippines-typhoon.html,12,MANILA  The powerful typhoon that swept across the Philippines on Friday one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall cut a path of destruction through several central islands leaving the seaside city of Tacloban in ruins and leading to early unconfirmed estimates of as many as 10000 dead.         Wire reports quoted the city administrator of Tacloban suggesting that the death toll could reach 10000 in his city alone. A police official gave an identical estimate citing the governor of the area who had spoken with officials in villages that had been hit according to wire reports.         The government disaster agency said it could confirm only about 150 deaths so far from Typhoon Haiyan although the president said he expected the number to rise significantly. The Red Cross in Manila said earlier on Saturday that its people on the ground were reporting an estimated 1000 deaths on Leyte Island where Tacloban is and about 200 on the neighboring island of Samar.         The local Red Cross chapter has seen many bodies Gwendolyn Pang the secretary general of the Philippine Red Cross said in a text message. An actual body count has to be done to determine the exact number.         The destruction which has taken down phone service in many areas made confirming any of the accounts difficult.         Some meteorologists said the storm called Yolanda in the Philippines hit land with sustained winds above 190 miles per hour while others reported winds of 150 miles per hour. On Friday some in the country thought the Philippines might have been spared high casualties because the storm had moved so quickly but they did not know that it had caused a serious storm surge at least in Tacloban.         Photos and television footage showed fierce winds ripping tin roofs off homes and sending waves crashing into wooden buildings that splintered under the force. Large ships were tossed on shore and vehicles were shown piled up on top of one another. Video footage from Tacloban showed ocean water rushing through the streets of the city which has an estimated population of 220000.         Speaking to Reuters the manager of the citys airport which is on a strip of land that juts into the sea estimated that water there rose up to 13 feet. Reuters also quoted a spokesman for the national disaster agency saying many houses in Tacloban were destroyed.         A bicycle taxi driver who lives near the airport told The Associated Press that he and his family had taken refuge in a parked jeep which was swept away in the roiling waters. The man Sandy Torotoro said that as the vehicle floated by many people screamed for help as they were swept away waving their hands above the water.         But what can we do? he said. We also needed to be helped.         The Social Welfare and Development Department said that the storm affected 4.28 million people in about 270 towns and cities spread across 36 provinces in the central Philippines.         President Benigno S. Aquino III said at a news briefing on Saturday evening in Manila that he expected there to be substantially more deaths than the government had confirmed. He arrived Sunday in Tacloban according to a member of Parliament.         The government has been flying in military cargo planes carrying food clothing and shelters but blocked roads have made distribution difficult.         A United Nations disaster assessment team visited the area on Saturday.         The last time I saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami Sebastian Rhodes Stampa the head of the team said in a statement referring to the 2004 tsunami that devastated parts of Indonesia and other countries. This is destruction on a massive scale. There are cars thrown like tumbleweed.         Richard Gordon the chairman of the Philippine Red Cross said in an interview that most of the information about damage and casualties was coming out of Tacloban where the news media and government officials were concentrated and that he feared there would be a lot of dead bodies inland as well. He said there were also areas out of contact in northern Cebu and on the island of Panay as well as parts of Palawan and Mindoro.         Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel directed the United States militarys Pacific Command to provide airborne and maritime search and rescue teams and other help a Department of Defense statementÂ on SaturdayÂ said.         According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council the deadliest storm in Philippine history was Tropical Storm Thelma which killed more than 5000 people.         Daniel E.

296,100000002540664,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,"Revivals Victorian, Gothic and Civic",LISA SELIN DAVIS,1420,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/nyregion/newburgh-ny-seeks-renewal-without-gentrification.html,6,NEWBURGH N.Y.  As Hannah Brooks drove down Liberty Street she felt the magnetic pull of this city 60 miles north of Manhattan with its Hudson River views its architectural masterpieces and its shocking decay. You drive through these damaged areas and you find pockets of these amazing buildings saidÂ Ms. Brooks who was at the time a resident of Fort Greene Brooklyn. You can see that theyre crying out to be saved.         She decided to do just that. Ms. Brooks joined dozens of former New Yorkers who in recent years have decamped for Newburgh hoping to rescue one of New York States most notorious cities by way of architectural restoration.         Restoring it needs. Newburgh was George Washingtons Revolutionary War headquarters; that 18th-century farmhouse still stands in the center of town. Later it was the stamping ground of the 19th centurys version of todays starchitects including  Andrew Jackson Downing  and his disciples like  Calvert Vaux  and  Frederick Clarke Withers . Their work  grand Second Empire Victorian Gothic revival and Queen Anne houses  is everywhere.         But the city succumbed to a panoply of 20th-century ills: deindustrialization; urban renewal which claimed a third of the citys older homes and detached the city from its waterfront; and the creation of the Newburgh-Beacon bridge which replaced the ferry as the main mode of transport across the river and took visitors around the city rather than through it. Now more than a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line. Blight is ubiquitous pockmarking the streetscape between renovated homes and the city has a well-known  gang and drug problem .         It has a grittiness and an elegance said  Robert Fontaine Jr.  an actor and director from Bay Ridge Brooklyn who bought and rehabbed a house on one of Newburghs more infamous blocks last year. Theres so much beauty and so much decay and so much potential.         The most direct route to that potential many believe is through the citys affordable architecture. Fixer-uppers can sell for as little as $30000 and renovated Victorian homes with Hudson River views can be had for $200000. One nonprofit group markets the city as Like Brooklyn but affordable.         Newburgh is reminiscent of that borough in its urban fabric with its dense pockets of rowhouses and its racially diverse population. But it is perhaps the only city vying for the title of the next Brooklyn that likens itself more to 1980s Brooklyn than the current incarnation with its locavore restaurants and multimillion-dollar condos.         When we moved to Brooklyn 30 years ago there were drug dealers down the street said Judy Johnson who with her partner Terri Vargas bought a 5600-square-foot Victorian designed by Calvert Vaux in Newburgh in 2001. That old Brooklyn street: Prospect Park West.         Sherry Ou-yang a family therapist who had been living in Ditmas Park in Brooklyn first saw a foreclosed Second Empire Victorian house in Newburgh listed online for $199000. It was too expensive then but when the price dropped to $35000 in 2009 she bought it from the bank; by then it was in serious disrepair mirroring the decay around it. We saw that we could really make a difference in this community just through fixing a house she said.         Pioneering in real estate can be morally ambiguous benefiting homeowners who score a bargain and in many cases who profit from a previous owners grief. But Newburgh has at least 700 vacant buildings inflating property taxes; the more taxpaying homeowners there are the lower the taxes for everyone.         The people who are moving in are helping because theyre putting more properties on the tax roll saidÂ Deirdre Glenn a lifelong Newburgher and former executive director of the local chapter of Habitat for Humanity which has built 72 neo-Victorian homes for low-income families in some of Newburghs most challenged areas. She noted that it can be hard to get  homeowners insurance  or sell a house when the surrounding properties are abandoned. Newburgh was really depressing and very run-down and very rough and at times threatening Ms. Glenn said. Its wonderful to see people caring about their houses again.         This is not just gentrification say longtime Newburghers as well as the newcomers. The new arrivals are not replacing lifelong residents to open artisanal mayonnaise shops; instead they are joining the community. Decora Sandiford a hip-hop artist who moved from Brownsville Brooklyn to Newburgh in 2005 said his block had 13 abandoned properties when he moved; now there are three the others having been renovated by residents of diverse classes races and sexual orientations. Its not just developers or just middle-class white people buying these houses  its black people and Latino people and they might not even be middle-class he said. Mr. Sandiford said that fixing up properties forces neighbors to stop dumping their garbage on the sites. It makes everyone stay on top of their game he said.         Though many people in Newburgh are happy to see the abandoned buildings restored some are skeptical about the impact on the citys entrenched problems including its lack of industry and its continuing battle against drugs and gangs.         Its great that the houses are getting fixed up said Kendrick Robinson a lifelong resident. But they have to do something about the crime the transportation and the jobs.         This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 9 2013 An earlier version of a caption misidentified the architect of a historic home shown.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 15 2013 An earlier version of the correction about the historic home misidentified the architect as Andrew Jackson Downing.

297,100000002542677,0,Article,News,Fashion & Style,fashion,,Robert Rhinehart: Dreaming of the Skies and Traveling Light,DAVID COLMAN,785,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/fashion/Robert-Rhinehart-Soylent-Inventor-Loves-to-Fly-.html,13,Progress can be slippery to define. After all one persons progress is another ones transgress. Case in point:  Soylent  the food-replacement drink that Robert Rhinehart concocted and has been living on for more than 10 months. The project has sparked enough controversy and raised enough money onÂ Crowdhoster for him to start manufacturing it. (The first shipments are expected to go out next month.)         Some people believe that an easy-to-mix drink that nourishes better than junk food and far better than no food is a step in the right direction. Others (foodies especially) think that the path to healthier living should be paved with fresh locally grown foods not tasty chemical insta-sludge. So is it progress or crab grass?         For his part Mr. Rhinehart 25 is no cartoonishly evil genius trying to force humanity into a foodless future and get rich in the process. He was trying to solve a problem. Young poor and slaving away at various start-up projects in Silicon Valley he got out the slide rule to see where he could save time and money. The answer was food.         He and his roommate David Renteln a biologist were eating poorly doing their minds and bodies no favors and even pizza delivery adds up. So they started theorizing about a faster and better alternative looking at lunch the way a software engineer might look at the dozen or so keystrokes a task requires and knock that number down to one or two. In Silicon circles its called creating a macro though it hardly originated there. Every BTW LOL and NSFW stems from the same impulse.         If Mr. Rhinehart is cartoonishly representative of anything it is the highly reductive urge to separate the wheat from the chaff a compulsion born in college.         Once I started traveling and hiking a lot I really started looking at the things I had he said. You want to be aggressively minimal to get the volume and mass of everything as low as possible. Then I started to do the same thing in my normal life. I know the maximum volume and the cost of everything I own. I could replace it all for like $2000 in one day.         Even low-mass possessions  sentimental things postcards from girlfriends and the like  were deep-sixed. Its just less of a mental burden he said. The less I have in the real world the more space I have in my mind. Actually it seemed that the harder something was to get rid of the more cleansing it was to do it.         Appropriately the one thing Mr. Rhinehart feels rapturous about having is something he has only briefly and sporadically if he really has it at all. A seat on a plane  preferably on the newest state-of-the-art jumbo jet.         His dream date is the  Boeing 787 Dreamliner . To him the airplane is all a breathtakingly sophisticated triumph of technology put into direct everyday use for humankind doing something he still finds majestically glorious. Poetry in flight as it were. He even likes going to the airport.         Its so beautiful and powerful he said of the airplane. Its this incredible representation of the potential of the man-machine system.         The passion is a longstanding one: as a child he wanted to be a jet pilot went to air shows at a nearby base with his father vividly remembers his first flight and built many models of his favorites: the  F-22  F-16 SR-71.         Fighter jets because of course they were the coolest he said. But now I have more respect for the  Dreamliner . It would be better to use this technology to move people rather than shoot missiles at them.         Mr. Rhineharts fantasy flight on the 787 which started flying commercially in October 2011 has yet to happen but his ardor was undimmed earlier this year when all 50 of the 787s in use were grounded for three months because of fire concerns with the batteries.         Its very very difficult to design something anywhere close to that complexity he said of the 787 ticking off its advancements. Its lighter and more fuel-efficient and they use more carbon fiber which means its wider and stronger so they can pressurize the cabin more which means you dont feel like youre at such a high altitude which means you dont get tired when you travel. I love that its still getting better.         And he brooks no guff from people dissatisfied with modern jet travel: the cramped seats in coach the luggage fees the inadequate Wi-Fi.         Yeah when people complain I am like Get some perspective: this is awesome!Â          And of course it is all the more awesome when you have no baggage to weigh you down.

298,100000002534178,0,Article,News,Arts,arts,dance,"Still Tingling Spines, After 25 Years",ALASTAIR MACAULAY,1495,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/arts/dance/lallegro-mark-morriss-renowned-masterwork-returns.html,8,Some artistic creations cause immediate sensations and some create a sense of wonder. With only a very few however does that sense of wonder address the entire culture that has produced the work of art. One such piece is Mark Morriss  Allegro il Penseroso ed il Moderato  a full-evening dance work that has almost invariably had a sensational effect on audiences and celebrates its 25th anniversary this month. When it was young its virtues of innocence exuberance and abundance amazed many viewers. (Our era can produce this?) In the last two years I have met other people who have felt the same way after seeing it for the first time.         It seemed a masterpiece in its opening season; 25 years on it is also a classic. Over the years I have revisited it in cities from Paris to Berkeley Calif. Ive seen experienced music and theater critics emerge from their first viewing with tear-stained and flushed cheeks; they simply hadnt known they would live to see a work so flooded with beauty.         On Nov. 21 LAllegro  returns to New York   presented at the David H. Koch Theater as part of the  White Light Festival   for what will be the works fifth season at Lincoln Center. (Its first local appearance was at the Brooklyn Academy of Music where it later had a second season.) Other statistics are also impressive. Its been danced in nine states nine countries (next year Spain will make it 10) in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and in 22 cities. (Madrid will be the 23rd.)         Such numbers would be less remarkable if LAllegro were a ballet acquired by companies worldwide the way that troupes everywhere perform works by Marius Petipa George Balanchine or Christopher Wheeldon. Yet this piece has been danced solely by the Mark Morris Dance Group. Mr. Morris was just 32 when he created it and his company was eight years old.         Though it reveals great complexity of thought structure and mood  the labels classical Romantic modernist and postmodernist all apply here  its most exceptional quality is its innocence. The work opens like a creation myth. Across a dark stage dancers run at top speed like random atoms until suddenly  bang on the music  two of them collide and form a molecule. The world that emerges from this beginning is a radiantly young and naÃ¯ve one with nymphs and muses in landscapes that seldom suggest urban civilization.         Often theres a Noahs ark feeling: two of every species. Mr. Morris has choreographed many dualisms over the years but there is a special freshness to the duos that people the stage in this piece. Like Balanchines 1946 ballet  The Four Temperaments  Mr. Morriss Allegro is a work that addresses root elements of human personality. LAllegro and il Penseroso are seemingly opposite ways of addressing the world and life.         The dance is set to the Handel oratorio LAllegro il Penseroso ed il Moderato (1740) which draws words from Miltons 1645 poems  LAllegro  and  Il Penseroso . Miltons two archetypes invoke the lives of action and contemplation. Handels friend Charles Jennens arranged the poems in alternating sections and the music shows how both Allegro and Penseroso by devoting considerable time to pondering each others states actually overlap.         Nonetheless Jennens balanced the two by adding a suite of Moderato numbers; in one  As steals the morn  he adapts words from Shakespeares Tempest. In planning the piece Mr. Morris took ideas from  William Blakes illustrations  for Miltons two poems; so this dance enlists a whole lineage of English art.         And the lineage goes back further than England. Thanks to Miltons words much of Mr. Morriss piece recreates the Arcadian worlds of Theocritus Virgil and many other Greek and Latin authors. Its young world is peopled by nymphs muses shepherds lovers  humans coexisting with mythological deities or allegorical spirits.         The way that Mr. Morris layers his stage world throughout is extraordinary. Two of the most simple-seeming scenes depict individual birds: the Allegro bird (danced by a man) is the lark while the  Penseroso bird  (played by a woman) is the nightingale. The lark is the extrovert embodiment of Mirth the nightingale the introvert personification of Melancholy. But Mr. Morris accompanies each bird with an alter ego. Theres a central scene when these two doppelgÃ¤ngers meet and stand beside each other heads tipping warily intensely birdlike and intensely curious as Mirth and Melancholy in their forms contemplate each other.         The bird of the main lark solo addresses the human world (humans come to their windows at his call) but the nightingale addresses the moon a sphere formed by dancers that passes across the back of the stage. The suggestion is one of Romantic longing: The nightingale becomes a poet pining for a remote realm of greater purity and beauty.         LAllegro suggests several times that there are more worlds than one. Its a Platonic notion: The forms of this world take their substance from an ideal one. The scenery designer Adrienne Lobel and the lighting designer James F. Ingalls achieve this with a magical use of gauzes and contrasting zones of light and shade.        
299,100000002542775,0,Article,News,Fashion & Style,fashion,,How the Internet Has Changed the R.S.V.P.,HENRY ALFORD,1304,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/fashion/how-the-internet-has-changed-the-rsvp.html,2,With ease come presumption and murk. Take for instance the modern R.S.V.P. The Internet has allowed a host or event producer to painlessly publicize his or her event to sultans and skateboarders in minutes the digital invitation beaming on their computer screens and cellphones like an onion puff dangling from a stick.         The  Evite  has also saved us from the plumed scroll and the careful unrolling of the parchment said Francine Maroukian who has written books about entertaining for Esquire and Town & Country. Not to mention glitter in envelopes.         But hasnt all of this ease and streamlining also helped erode the social contract that is at the heart of an R.S.V.P.? Hunt Slonem a painter and frequent dinner party host said: I dont know if people take an online invitation as seriously as a printed one anymore. A lot more people R.S.V.P. than show up because its so easy to R.S.V.P.         The chef and television host Rocco DiSpirito concurred. People have gotten extremely wiggly about R.S.V.P.ing he said. People either dont R.S.V.P. and show up anyway or they R.S.V.P. yes to everything and decide later what their best option is.         If youre looking for evidence of Monsieur Reservezs reduced circumstances you need look no further than the fact that its not uncommon these days to be emailed a reminder that the event to which you R.S.V.P.ed three weeks ago is happening tonight. Or that its now possible with a Facebook invitation to be offered the option Maybe. Both are canaries in the R.S.V.P. coal mine.         However guests  even those who do respond to invitations in the affirmative but who then text their regrets at the last minute  are not solely to blame. Hosts themselves are upping the murkiness factor. Earlier this year I but not my boyfriend received an invitation to the glamorous Brooklyn brownstone of someone who knows us both. As it turned out I was fairly sure that a 6 p.m. obligation that same evening would preclude my attendance. Given the host and the augustness of the occasion for which the party was being held I was 90 percent certain that the party would be catered and therefore that a head count would be important; however the invitation did not bear the initials R.S.V.P. So the party was exclusive enough that only one member of my dyad was invited but not so exclusive that an R.S.V.P. was required. My mind slightly reeled.         A few months later I received a dinner invitation from a different source in which I was told that I wasnt required to respond but that it might help anyway.         The newly relaxed attitudes toward R.S.V.P.s can be especially acute with events that are not specifically dinner or cocktail events. Mari Meehan a retiree in northern Idaho said that a few years ago she and her husband were emailed an invitation to the wedding of the son of a former business associate of her husband. Mind you we had never met the son nor his lady and had not had any contact with the business associate for years. So Hub clicked on the Will Not Be Attending option. A few months later he received an e-announcement: its a boy. A few months later he received an e-announcement that a boy had actually been born. It seemed to us that it was a rather tacky solicitation for gifts in both cases.         Paul Cram an actor in Minneapolis said that two years ago he R.S.V.P.ed yes to an Evite for a play that a friend was performing in. Once in attendance Mr. Cram discovered that the not-wonderful play was almost three hours long and that his friend had only a few lines in the last four minutes of the show. After the show Mr. Cram congratulated his friend but also conveyed his surprise that she wanted him in attendance. She tells me: Oh no I didnt mean that to be taken as a you-have-to-attend personal invitation. You should have called me to see if its something I wanted you to come to. Now I dont respond to Evites.         Henry Alford is the author of Would It Kill You to Stop Doing That?

300,100000002539469,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,The Pop-Up Activist of the Lower East Side,JOHN LELAND,1300,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/nyregion/the-pop-up-activist-of-the-lower-east-side.html,7,Eric Ho watches the boom on the Lower East Side the torrent of new restaurants and boutiques opening and sees something different. He sees Detroit. Specifically walking the neighborhood last spring he saw vacant storefronts  more than 200 of them in the area east of the Bowery and south of 14th Street.         How was it possible he thought that in a neighborhood where space was at such a premium so much of it was sitting idle? Mr. Ho 32 is an architect who once intended to design housing for disaster zones. Counting the empty properties he thought: What could be done with them?         Theres all these people who want space he said. And theres all this space. There must be some way to bring them together.         He quit his job and started thinking. The question for me he said is what can we do in the space that benefits the community?         Last week he began a preliminary answer: a  series of seven pop-ups in seven weeks  in a  storefront  on Delancey Street.         Instead of the usual pop-up store from retailers looking for buzz Mr. Hos pop-ups will house organizations that might not be able to afford permanent retail space in the neighborhood  a mix of nonprofits and for-profits none with big budgets. Tenants will range from a syringe-exchange program for homeless transients to an online community of knitters.         In conversations over the last couple of weeks Mr. Ho variously likened his venture called  Made in the Lower East Side  or  MiLES  to the home-sharing website  Airbnb  which puts idle resources to use and to a  community garden  which turns neighborhood blight into something useful to residents.         This way of collaboration and sharing is ripe he said during a recent walk past some of the vacant storefronts. People are sharing cars; people are sharing work space. Because of technology were able to start doing that more. I want everyone to have a chance at the space  not just the bars or big brands but also the community groups also the designers also the struggling artists.         For Mr. Ho the seven-week project is also a showcase for his prototype  storefront transformer : a six-foot wooden cube on wheels that contains the components for tables seats a screen display cases a stage lighting Wi-Fi and a P.A. system  an instant pop-up in a rolling box.         In a city where change often involves immense sums of money the financing for Mr. Hos project feels almost vaporous like loose nutrients harvested out of the air.         Mr. Ho is living on his savings. Money to rent the storefront and build the transformer  $33991 in total  was raised through the crowdfunding  website Kickstarter  with the biggest contributors paying $1000 or $1500 in exchange for small promotional displays.         Karen Wong deputy director of the  New Museum  which featured Mr. Ho at its  Ideas City  Festival this year likened him to other young architects who were pursuing socially conscious goals including the designers of the  Plus Pool  which is supposed to someday float in the East River while filtering the water and the  Lowline  a proposed underground park below Delancey Street. I see MiLES as really community activism 2.0 using a public and private equation Ms. Wong said.         As landlords hold out for tenants who can pay higher rents Mr. Ho offered a way to serve both developers and the residents with whom they are often at odds without bringing more bars into a neighborhood many consider already oversaturated Ms. Wong said. If theyre successful she said therell no longer be 200 vacant storefronts in the Lower East Side which bring the neighborhood down. Its not an endgame but a chapter into how do you remake a city from the bottom up?         A week before opening day Mr. Ho was swimming in stress. The company hed hired to build the storefront transformer wouldnt have it ready until Week 2. The original spaces landlord found a long-term tenant forcing Mr. Ho to scramble for a new site which he found in an architects office by the Williamsburg Bridge  a little small and away from the neighborhoods foot traffic but it would do he said.         Then there were the organizations themselves. Many still hadnt decided how they were going to use their time and the architect was pressing Mr. Ho about potential disruption to his business. Week 7 belonged to  Ghetto Gastro  a catering and events company run by Bronx chefs; were they planning to have late-night parties? Week 3 paired two potentially dissonant projects:  Kollabora  an online community for knitters and other low-tech crafts and the  Makery  known for its high-tech workshops in electronics and 3-D printing; how would the two work together?         And what if no one paid attention or the tenants flaked or the clients of the  Space at Tompkins  the group that serves homeless transients  the anarchists as the head of the architecture office  Gordon Kipping  described them  clashed with the architects?         Its just so fast. We know that its coming but now its here Mr. Ho said.         Finally Nov. 4 arrived  opening day  with a pop-up  museum  dedicated to the comic book artist  Jack Kirby  who was a creator of Captain America the X-Men the Fantastic Four and other popular characters. The opening was scheduled for 7 p.m. By 6:30 p.m. the space was filled mostly with middle-aged men  a testimony to the power of Mr. Kirby and social media.         I see this as a prototype alpha  a test to see what we could possibly do in a storefront said Randolph Hoppe the museums treasurer adding that he hoped to parlay the exposure into grants or corporate funding for a three-month pop-up.

301,100000002542790,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,How Hipsters Ruined Paris,THOMAS CHATTERTON WILLIAMS,1226,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/how-hipsters-ruined-paris.html,4,PARIS  THE  northern edge  of Pariss Ninth Arrondissement near the Place Pigalle was once known as la Nouvelle-AthÃ¨nes both for the neo-Classical flourishes of its most graceful blocks and for the creative geniuses who swept in to inhabit them.         This was the original gay Paree on display in Edouard Manets  Bar at the Folies-BergÃ¨re  a Bohemia of near-mythical proportions in which every tier of society  from the well heeled to the creative to the horizontally employed  collided in the districts cafes theaters and cabarets. It was the Paris of Alexandre Dumas Victor Hugo Gustave Moreau and Pierre-Auguste Renoir.         Paris has long been a palimpsest of different cities each new iteration grafted on top of the still visible last spanning the extremes of human excellence and beauty and just as crucially filth and squalor. The area around Pigalle in particular  which American G.I.s aptly called Pig Alley  was always a mixture of both its seediness informing the artistic production and spirit of numerous generations of inhabitants. You can see it in  Edgar Degass brush strokes  and hear it in Edith Piafs voice.         But its disappearing. Today the neighborhood has been rechristened South Pigalle or in a disheartening aping of New York SoPi. Organic grocers tasteful bistros and an influx of upscale American cocktail bars are quietly displacing the pharmacies dry cleaners and scores of seedy bar Ã  hÃ´tesses that for decades have defined the neighborhood.         These hostess bars marked by barely dressed women perched in the windows are the direct descendants of the regulated brothels that thrived here from Napoleons time until the postwar purge of the 1940s. The French daily LibÃ©ration  reports  that in 2005 there were 84 such establishments around Pigalle. Today there are fewer than 20. Their disappearance is a watermark of the quarters rapid loss of grit and character alike.         When my wife and I first moved here in 2011 I wasnt sure what to make of living in the middle of a functioning red-light district. Our neighborhood though safe and well on its way to gentrification remained funky in the original sense of the term. In addition to cigarette smoke and baking bread there was the whiff of dirt and sex in the air. It took a while for me to get used to the tap-tapping on windows  or hissing and tongue clicking from open doors  that greeted me as I passed the bars on my way to fill a prescription or buy a bottle of Pouilly-FumÃ©.         I have never quite gotten used to the transsexual hookers who traipse the Boulevard de Clichy outside the areas various sex shops and with whom I must share the carnivalesque sidewalk on my way in and out of the post office. Frankly they make me uncomfortable.         But Ive come to see that unease as a good thing the longer I stay in this corner of France a country where the worlds oldest profession continues to enjoy a special patrimonial status and where try as it might the government cant seem to un-sew that tawdry patch from the national quilt. (It is now considering criminalizing johns which prompted incensed writers and luminaries  to pen a spirited manifesto  in protest.)         We should be grateful to be jolted from our anesthetized routines confronted when we can be with surroundings and neighbors that are not injection-molded to the contours of our own  bobo  predilections. Too much of modern urban life revolves around never feeling less than fully at ease; about having even the minutest of experiences tailored to a set of increasingly demanding and homogeneous tastes  from the properly sourced coffee grounds that make the mornings flat white to the laboriously considered iPod soundtracks we rely on to cancel the worlds noise. The logical extension is to curate our urban spaces like  style blogs  or Pinterest boards representing a single self-satisfied and extremely sheltered expression of middle- and upper-middle-class sensibility.         Outside my window and adjacent to a baby boutique that stocks cashmere swaddle blankets is a nondescript Asian massage parlor. On nice summer days there is one masseuse who likes to prop open the door pull her chiropractic table into the fresh air and sunbathe between clients. Once I watched a well-turned-out mother with toddler approach as the woman was smoking a cigarette. Instead of giving the kind of not-in-my-backyard glare I imagined her Park Slope counterpart might unleash she just asked the masseuse for a light. They shared a few friendly words before going their separate ways leaving me to wonder why I thought that should be odd.         SUCH encounters are getting rarer by the week but they remind me that genuinely engaging with an urban space means encountering and making room for an assortment of lifestyles and social realities  some appealing some provocative and some repulsive. This is what the Situationists meant by psychogeography or as Guy Debord put it the specific effects of the geographical environment (whether consciously organized or not) on the emotions and behavior of individuals.         Down the street where Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec once had his studio you now must pass a store called  Pigalle  a high-end streetwear purveyor   and then Buvette GastrotÃ¨que the handsome new Paris outpost of a faux-French restaurant and bar from the West Village.         From there a left turn puts you at the intersection of Rue Victor MassÃ© and Rue Frochot where in the space of one half-block three hostess bars have recently been shuttered and reopened as upscale cocktail lounges. That number includes the famous Dirty Dick now a Polynesian-themed luxury rum bar with the name and grungy facade kept ironically intact. Inside the atmosphere is far more beach bum than bordello; the most subversive element is a smoking room in the back.         Directly opposite beside a dilapidated DVD shop black-clad bouncers assemble a velvet rope each night in front of a pristine new bar called Glass. It is the brainchild of a polyglot team of N.Y.U. grads who have decided (correctly judging by their success) that what Parisians want most these days are tacos hot dogs and homemade tonic water in their G & Ts. Le FExhib  the lone holdout on the block where the girls and the ravaged exterior seemed to age in tandem  finally closed its doors this fall.         And so a vivid and storied layer of authentic Paris is being wiped out not by not-in-my-backyard activism government edict or the rapaciousness of Starbucks or McDonalds but by the banal globalization of hipster good taste the same pleasant and invisible force that puts kale frittata steel-cut oats and burrata salad on brunch tables from Stockholm to San Francisco.         Drifting through these streets as they are scrubbed clean and homogenized before my eyes my thoughts turn to Blaise Pascal who once wrote a man does not show his greatness by being at one extremity but rather by touching both at once. The same of course could be said of neighborhoods. The nicer this one gets the more it seems to feel like the one I left behind in Brooklyn.         People say you had to be in Paris in the 20s or New York in the 80s. The sad truth of our contemporary moment seems to be only that you no longer need to be anywhere in particular anymore.         The brunch is all the same.         Thomas Chatterton Williams is the  author  of Losing My Cool: Love Literature and a Black Mans Escape From the Crowd now at work on a novel about a shooting on Long Island.Â         Also in Video »

Whether despite or because of his unusual looks Mr. Driver finds himself on the eve of the hit cable shows highly anticipated third season (it returns in January) both a breakout star and more curious still an unexpected new favorite of fashion.         Besides finishing up Girls in the past year the actor (who turns 30 next week) shot This Is Where I Leave You an indie film about a family sitting shiva; played a comic in the Coen brothers Inside Llewyn Davis; portrayed a photographer on a 1700-mile camel journey through the Outback in Tracks; filmed While Were Young a new Noah Baumbach movie in which he stars with Ben Stiller and Amanda Seyfried; and stars in The Coward cast as an 18th-century dandy opposite Chris ODowd.         Somehow he also found time to model for a September Vogue pictorial shot in Ireland by Annie Leibovitz and for Gaps new Back to Blue ad campaign which had its debut in mid-September and marked the brands return to TV advertising for the first time since 2009.         I dont totally get it the actor said one recent morning over coffee at a communal table in a cafe near his home in Brooklyn Heights. I mean when I read for Girls I was like the script says Handsome Carpenter so someone else is going to get the part. Theyll have someone handsome not me. I mean Im not in any danger of getting leading-man parts.         Yet its precisely Mr. Drivers unconventional looks  hooded eyes strong brow long nose and wide mouth  and his brooding quality used as a temporal placeholder that permits him to wait a beat longer in scenes than seems plausible that first attracted  Lena Dunham s attention.         What is his quality? Ms. Dunham said recently by phone. He has this amazing presence this thoughtfulness. The articles about him dont say what an amazing actor he is but I can tell you that just watching him work is freaky.         It was Mr. Drivers quality of stillness that most powerfully struckÂ Inez van Lamsweerde the Dutch photographer who with her partner Vinoodh Matadin shot the new Gap campaign. Obviously its not a cookie-cutter beauty Ms. van Lamsweerde said. He has this very big face and eyes that are rather slanted.         Unlike video or movie cameras she added the still camera freezes a subject and thus sees things in a different way. Everything becomes much more pronounced she said. The discovery for us with Adam when we saw the pictures was this elegance that was sort of hypnotizing.         There was also Ms. van Lamsweerde said this: The body is brilliant. Hers is a sentiment shared not merely by the fans who made Mr. Driver the goofy hipster sex symbol in Girls but also apparently by seasoned fashion types like Ms. Leibovitz and Grace Coddington of Vogue.         I think it was Adams unusual combination of physicality and soulfulness in Girls that inspired his casting in the Vogue shoot in Ireland in which he appears bare-chested and with a ram slung across his shoulders said Valerie Steiker the magazines culture editor. He was like a cross between Raging Bull-era De Niro and Nicolas Cage in Moonstruck.Â          Mr. Driver characterizes his Girls character Adam Sackler in more prosaic terms: Hes part poet part rhinoceros and part Neanderthal.         If all the recent hype the adulation the Emmy nomination and the breathless encomiums from the fashion flock have gone to the actors head he does a credible job of concealing it. The deadly thing in my job is to attach too much meaning to everything said Mr. Driver who in person is thoughtful and unnervingly sincere and smart enough to take a gimlet-eyed view of the overnight stardom that took him a decade to achieve. You have to have a sense of humor about yourself.         He was so nonchalant about losing the Emmy award for best supporting actor in a series to Tony Hale of Veep that Ms. Dunham said she was inspired to tell him he had been robbed.         This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 17 2013 An article last Sunday about the actor Adam Driver misstated the name of the Dutch photographer who took his pictures for a Gap ad campaign. She is Inez van Lamsweerde not Iris von Lamsweerde.

A crisis call center for veterans based in Canandaigua N.Y. is at the forefront of trying to address the problem and the harrowing work done by operators there is chronicled in  Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press 1  a documentary on HBO at 9 p.m. on Monday Veterans Day.          One study  has found that the suicides do not correlate with battlefield trauma but the people answering the phones certainly hear their share of stories about the horrors of war. The film by Ellen Goosenberg Kent observes as these soothing steady voices try to prevent callers from hurting themselves while working to dispatch help. Sometimes they lose the race against the clock and that brings its own kind of trauma.         I start to question whether I did a good enough job one worker says. Could I have found him faster? Was I doing all the things that I was taught to do? Did I make any mistakes? And how dare you take your life? All those things go through my mind.

Ms. Mutu will show a new video based on the East African myth of the nguva or mermaid and the artists William Cordova Nyeema Morgan and Otabenga Jones & Associates will collaborate on a huge wooden structure that looks a little like a hovering spaceship.

On the ceiling of the Hollywood Hills home were paintings by Paolo de Matteis an 18th-century Baroque artist which Mr. Vidal had hung in La Rondinaia his home in Ravello Italy which he sold in 2005. Mr. Vidal who died in July 2012 at 86 in a bed set up in the living room with its view of tall trees that reminded him of Italy once fondly described a de Matteis figure a barely clothed maiden with arms wantonly outstretched as one of his famous houseguests and friends: Princess Margaret asking for a gin and tonic.         Mr. Steers 48 a screenwriter and director of movies including Igby Goes Down and Charlie St. Cloud advised me to not sit in one chair. He lost control of his bladder so that chairs been through a lot of ugly things he said.         A study room contained Mr. Vidals work neatly shelved: the 25 novels and the 26 nonfiction works including his celebrated and controversial essays. (He also wrote 14 screenplays and eight stage plays.) In part of the garden a swimming pool was full of water but was a brackish mess of dirt and cracks.         You could see William Holden floating face down in this couldnt you? said Mr. Steers invoking Sunset Boulevard. Norma Desmond was kind of what Gore was becoming.         His tone was affectionate but then Mr. Steers revealed as an abrupt aside that his uncle had left nothing to his family or intimates in his will. Instead he bequeathed his entire fortune and assets to  Harvard University .         Mr. Steers said that Mr. Vidal had promised the property to him though as alcoholism and dementia had consumed the author in the last years of his life Mr. Vidal had also accused his once-beloved nephew of being a C.I.A. impostor and of trying to kidnap him. He had accused dedicated staff members of the same and feuded with and excommunicated friends.         Nina Straight Mr. Steerss mother and Mr. Vidals half sister is challenging her half brothers will on the grounds that Mr. Vidal was not mentally competent when he changed the terms of his will the year before he died. On Nov. 22 in Los Angeles County Court there will be a second hearing of case No. BP138192. On one side is Ms. Straight and on the other Andrew S. Auchincloss son of Mr. Vidals distant cousin Louis Auchincloss and the trustee of the Gore Vidal Revocable Trust which oversees Mr. Vidals estate.         The Harvard bequest mystifies Ms. Straight and Mr. Steers and many of the authors closest friends but it is also vintage Vidal: an appropriately ornery final salvo from a master contrarian. A close friend who asked not to be identified because of the familys sensitivity said: Anger was Gores default mode. He wanted to go out like Ebenezer Scrooge with a huge finger to everyone around him.         Mr. Steers said he was not angry about his uncles Harvard bequest but instead bruised and resigned. When I spoke to him last December for a book I was researching about Mr. Vidal Mr. Steers told me his uncles was a miserable drawn-out decline especially when one recalled his barnstorming public persona the growling intellectual maverick scattering his withering bon mots in prime time.         It was unsettling dealing with Gore with dementia Mr. Steers said. It was like having him replaced and someone very different take his place. He let go of everything. He ceased to be Gore.         Mr. Steers said Mr. Vidal in his original will left everything to Howard Austen his partner of 53 years who died in 2003 then amended it in 2011 awarding it to Harvard. A few paintings were bequeathed to the Huntington Library in San Marino Calif. At about that time Mr. Vidal also bought a house in the south of France.         Part of the idea was to relocate there and live in exile said the film director Matt Tyrnauer a close friend and former literary executor. Ultimately Mr. Vidal gave the house to his onetime assistant Muzius Gordon Dietzmann who lives there with his family. Mr. Vidal told Mr. Tyrnauer I have made him a rich boy.         Tim Teeman  is the author of In Bed With Gore Vidal: Hustlers Hollywood and the Private World of an American Master ( Riverdale Avenue Books/Magnus ).

311,100000002540938,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,"Neighbors, Yet Worlds Apart",GINIA BELLAFANTE,829,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/nyregion/de-blasio-could-help-the-rich-see-the-poor-living-next-door.html,5,If you lived in Apartment 17A at 1280 Fifth Avenue a Robert A. M. Stern-designed building which goes by the baptismal name  One Museum Mile  you would have acquired 1863 square feet for $2.8 million. After a while perhaps following the birth of a second child or during a bout of the kind of enervating status anxiety that afflicts so many in Manhattan you would find yourself coveting the combined unit upstairs  the five-bedroom place priced at $8.7 million. You dont have the money but maybe if you changed careers or husbands or gained a windfall from a dubious lawsuit you would. You indulge these fantasies even as you look out your window toward the gloomy austere towers of Schomburg Plaza a former Mitchell-Lama complex or walk four blocks east and south to the sprawl of projects on Madison Avenue.         The Stern building sits on the northeast corner of 109th Street and Fifth Avenue adjacent to a string of buildings refurbished by  Hope Community  a nonprofit development corporation founded in the late 1960s to rehabilitate abandoned housing in East Harlem. Susie Blanco lives in an apartment on 109th Street in the building abutting One Museum Mile. She endured a fair amount of rattle and commotion during the construction of the condominiums she told me. She has never met anyone who lives in them. But she assumes that those who do are responsible for usurping all of the parking.         On Wednesday morning Ms. Blanco crossed the street from her home and stood in a long line in front of the  New York Common Pantry  where she regularly goes to obtain the groceries it distributes to those in need. Over the years the rent has gone up on her one-bedroom apartment but her partners salary hasnt. There are utility bills to pay and a son to feed and the $200 a month she receives in food stamps to which federal cuts were made on Nov. 1 is insufficient to feed her family. During the Common Pantrys last fiscal year which ended on June 30 the demand for its services increased by 20 percent.         It is the discontent born of this juxtaposition the sudden eruption of a place called Upper Carnegie Hill in the middle of East Harlem that at least in part resulted in  Bill de Blasio s landslide victory as the 109th mayor of the city. In his acceptance speech Mr. de Blasio acknowledged the immense challenge of combating the inequities to which he has brought so much attention and observers have been dismissive of what he will actually be able to accomplish. But standing in front of a food pantry several yards from an apartment building with a rooftop pool makes at least one course of action self-evident which is to say that the mayor-elect could become a vocal advocate at the national level for increased federal funding for food relief and housing programs.         Hunger is an enormous issue here and across the country. From 2007 to 2012  a quarter of the citys food pantries and soup kitchens closed  even as need increased. The need will only escalate with further reductions to SNAP as the food stamp program is known.         Whatever funds the next mayor may or may not be able to extract from Washington whatever tax increases he may or may not be able to impose he can stand unimpeded as a promoter of comity a voice for a more seamless relationship between the citys largely self-isolating classes. This might take shape as a call to service to volunteerism to merely getting to know the people living within ones immediate radius. Contradictorily among the neighborhood   restaurants listed on One Museum Miles website  are a Mexican place on First Avenue and 64th Street more than two miles away and an Italian restaurant in the East 70s.         These ideas though they may seem naÃ¯ve and without any expedient purpose are embedded in the history of progressivism. During the reformist era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries major cities and New York in particular witnessed the growth of  settlement houses  which were created on the principle that students and wealthy individuals would settle in poor immigrant neighborhoods and help better the lot of the struggling. Until the mid-1900s staff members lived in these houses where English was taught and health services were offered; thus allowing the better off to observe the poor and working classes as neighbors rather than as clients.         It is through the personalized and direct involvement with the individual in the context of the family  often throughout a lifetime  that the settlement fosters and supports the values of fellowship and mutual support wrote Mary Kingsbury Simkhovitch a Massachusetts native who studied at Radcliffe and founded the Greenwich House in Greenwich Village in 1902. It was understood that the wealthy too could benefit from an engagement with the underclass that everyone was enriched by unity  an idea that ought to be more than archival.

Nicole Weiss 25 an aspiring singer songwriter and actress who lives in Astoria Queens showed a smartphone photo of herself working as a clown for childrens parties to Matt Hunziker a bearded 28-year-old writer and improv comedy performer who lives in Ditmas Park Brooklyn who shook his fists in apparent delight. Laura McDonald 25 an actress living in the financial district told Mike Greene a 27-year-old architect living in Fort Greene Brooklyn that Im pretty well known for my Kristen Stewart impressions.         And Alex Blum 25 a law student living in the East Village bought a second round of drinks and spoke to Julie Sygiel 25 who has a start-up lingerie line and lives in Midtown about his familys hardware business.         Discussing alma maters odd jobs and Zooey Deschanel the six seemed surprisingly comfortable considering that none had met before. They had been set up by  the Dating Ring  a matchmaking service that facilitates group dating.         Traditional online dating takes too much time said Lauren Kay 24 a founder of the Dating Ring which is headquartered in Dumbo Brooklyn and started last spring. She requires potential daters to meet with an in-house matchmaker Emma Tessler 25 before being set up at the cost of $20 a date in groups of three single men and women (with smaller groups of four for gay members in response to their feedback Ms. Kay said).         A group maximizes the chances that youll hit it off with someone Ms. Kay said. If youre not attracted to anyone its a good night and you try it again.         The Dating Ring is one of several companies banking on the idea that getting to know people in small clusters is more intuitive and less awkward and pressure-filled than meeting one-on-one.         This is because group dating is simply a version of general night life said Abel AcuÃ±a 25 a founder of  Martini  a group-dating service in New York Paris London and Seoul South Korea.         My friends go out in groups together he said. It makes sense for services to replicate what theyre seeing in real life.         Part of the appeal participants say is that these services make fewer claims about arranging romance promising only the low-stress opportunity of hanging out  or as Mr. AcuÃ±a puts it the joy of meeting up  whether one is interested in friendship networking or something more.         It leaves less of a scripted experience said Matt Hamilton a 24-year-old software engineer who lives in the meatpacking district and met his girlfriend via the Dating Ring. You have more freedom you go with the flow of conversation.         And even if the night is a bust at least sometimes you will walk away with a full stomach:  Dating in Groups  in Washington D.C. and  Grubwithus  in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Venice offer their users prepackaged dates at restaurants.          Grouper  a company in SoHo goes further billing itself as a social club somewhat de-emphasizing romantic connections. Each user signing up for the service which also costs $20 is matched with another user; both participants commit to bringing two friends to the date.         The breakdown is kind of like a bar; the vast majority is single but there are roommates and co-workers who might not be single but are there for moral support said Groupers chief executive Michael Waxman 26 who said he met his girlfriend of two years on a Grouper date. Weve seen engagements and serious relationships to friend groups merging together.         Mary Leigh Bliss 30 the trends editor at Ypulse a youth-oriented research firm said that such organizations make sense to what is known as the millennial generation.         They are team-oriented individuals who would much rather cultivate experiences together than on their own she said. They want to be around each other in real life and have experiences that are really collaborative. The digital is the means to the ends which is the in-person meet-up.         Some larger more traditional online dating companies are also discovering the allure of the crowd.         We are less excited about small groups and more excited about groups that are 12 and higher said Sam Yagan 36 a founder of  OKCupid.com  and the chief executive of  Match.com .         Match which is the worlds largest dating site holds events called Stir at which users meet for activities like sushi-making classes or D.J. lessons. These events have two advantages Mr. Yagan said.         Youre more likely to have fun even with no romantic spark he said. And theres a context and something to focus the time around.         He said group dating offers a different appeal to men and women.         Women like to be with other women Mr. Yagan said. Men just like the volume.         If nothing else group dating offers safety in numbers both physical and mental.

313,100000002540976,0,Article,News,Automobiles,automobiles,,Chamber Music of a Very Different Kind,LINDSAY BROOKE,674,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/automobiles/chamber-music-of-a-very-different-kind.html,2,The tones emanating from a cars exhaust pipes  a V8s deep bellow say or the piercing wail of a high-revving V12  have long been inspirations to an enthusiasts ear. What others may deem mere noise can appropriately tuned become a symphony of internal combustion.         With the help of computer modeling and some mechanical gadgetry automakers are tailoring exhaust notes to more precisely define the character of new models most vitally in those cars with high-performance credentials. No longer is the goal just to muffle the explosions taking place in the combustion chamber but to give the engine a voice as readily identified as a Carnegie Hall patron might distinguish a clarinet from an oboe.         Engines and their exhaust systems are very much like musical instruments in that they have different sound signatures based on the physics of the exhaust gas pulses and how they travel through the pipes Garry Dunne director of sound quality engineering at Jaguar Land Rover said in a telephone interview.         Each bang exiting a cylinder and hurtling down the tailpipe includes multiple harmonics a result of factors including the size and number of engine cylinders and the sequence and timing of their firing. Engineers tune the frequencies to create a pleasurable soundtrack  and to meet performance targets and noise regulations  by varying the exhaust pipe diameter and length and installing resonator chambers and mufflers of various shapes and sizes along the route. Materials matter too: Exhaust manifolds made of thick cast iron attenuate sound differently than those fabricated from thin steel tubing.         Full-time loudness is not the goal. Drivers are more likely to want a hushed growl around town saving the full-throated roar for the open road.         This duality is how Dr. Dunne describes Jaguars S versions of the new F-Type sports car which along with the  Chevrolet Corvette  Stingray offer active exhaust systems. In both cars electronically controlled flapper valves can open or close when the driver selects specific driving modes. Responding to the throttle the valves operate at very high speed.         They go from fully open to fully closed in about five milliseconds said Traci Melville an acoustics engineer at Tenneco the supplier company that developed the Corvettes valves. As a concept active exhaust systems have been entertaining drivers back to the Model T era when accessory catalogs bulged with ads for cut out valves. By the 1990s with the advent of miniature solenoids drivers could control the valves in the exhaust system of the  Mitsubishi 3000GT .         Since then automakers have introduced both electronic and pneumatically actuated ( Chevrolet Camaro  ZL1) valves while others have opted to pipe real ( Cadillac CTS ) or electronically reproduced exhaust sound ( BMW M5 ) into the cabin to achieve the same effect.         Creating more sonorous exhaust concerts has become a sophisticated science. It begins with a mathematical model of the engine and its combustion system said Tim Jackson Tennecos executive vice president for technology.         The model lets us test up to 1000 variations of an exhaust system right on the computer before we build the first part he said. We dont need to start with a real engine. We run the test all night then the next day we pick up to five systems that look the most promising.         The computer models create audio files which are played to an automakers jury through headphones in a dedicated quiet room. The jury chooses the sound packages that most closely match the intended character of the new vehicle.         At Jaguar Land Rover a team responsible for all new-car performance attributes signs off on the exhaust system acoustics Dr. Dunne said. He noted additional tricks of the trade that automakers were using to add spice to the tailpipe chorus. On the F-Type S custom fuel injection and ignition calibration make the exhaust pop and bang like a Tommy gun when the driver lifts off the gas.         Its the bit that makes the whole driving experience exciting Dr. Dunne said. Its a very fine balance in delivering the sound character we want for this car.

A more powerful version of the crossover that was the first 100 percent new Mazda in 45 years.          HOW MUCH?  $29665 base $31890 as tested with Soul Red paint ($300) and the Grand Touring tech package ($1625) that includes navigation keyless ignition high-intensity headlamps and a precollision emergency braking system.          WHATS UNDER THE HOOD?  2.5-liter 4-cylinder (184 horsepower 185 pound-feet of torque) with 6-speed automatic transmission.          IS IT THIRSTY?  With a federal rating of 24 m.p.g. in the city and 30 m.p.g. on the highway the CX5 2.5 AWD is thrifty enough but cant touch the 35 m.p.g. highway rating for the mileage-champ 2-liter model with a manual gearbox.         If I were an executive at Mazda Id be doing some serious headhunting over at Subaru.         That company once a weird northern phenomenon  the Japanese equivalent of Saab  is now crushing its own sales records year after year gunning for 400000 sales by year-end.         And kudos to them. They deserve it.         But Mazda also deserves more sales than its getting. Should not Mazda be at least as popular as Subaru? I argue that it should and I submit the CX-5 as proof.         The CX-5 is Mazdas first new crossover since the companys breakup with Ford in 2008. While the CX-5s predecessor the Tribute was a lightly disguised  Ford Escape  the CX-5 shares not a bolt with the current Escape. In fact Mazda says its the first completely new product  not a carry-over scrap from a previous Mazda or another manufacturer  since the Cosmo. Which if youre not up on your Mazda history was introduced in 1967.         Upon its introduction late last year the CX-5 was available with only a 2-liter 155-horsepower 4-cylinder an engine that is available with either a 6-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual. I drove the latter and loved it; manual-transmission crossovers are uncommon and Mazdas stick shifts are among the best on the road.         But I suspected given the public apathy for manuals that this wasnt really a representative CX-5. And according to Mazda its not: the manual-transmission version accounts for just 3 percent of CX-5 sales.         The current high-volume model introduced this year uses the larger more powerful 2.5-liter Skyactiv 4-cylinder. Fuel economy suffers slightly  about a mile per gallon compared with the 2-liter automatic model  but the added power is well worth the penalty. Buyers seem to agree as the 2.5-liter accounts for 81 percent of sales.         I drove a fully decked-out 2.5-liter Grand Touring AWD and found it to epitomize the challenge facing the company. Its an outstanding little crossover but its appeal lies in Mazdas mastery of the nuances  the feel of the steering wheel in your hands the chamfered smoothness of the motor the tightly dampened body motions as you navigate a twisty road. Theres nothing you can slap a number on and cry Best! Superlative! and yet you emerge from a drive wanting to convert anyone who will listen.         All of the companys vehicles are like that really. From the Mazda 3 to the Mazda 6 to the big CX-9 people mover theyre all masters of the intangibles the interaction between power and grip and the response of the controls.         Even Mazdas signature engine technology Skyactiv is a collection of small worthy upgrades (high compression ratio friction reduction direct injection) rather than one killer app.         Im sure Mazda marketers would rather offer the CX-5 Blammo Turbo  So much power youll spin the tires off the rims or well buy you a sandwich!  but instead theyre left trying to extol the virtues of a 4-2-1 exhaust manifold and an automatic transmission that uses a torque converter and a clutch.         I feel your pain Mazda. By the way the redesigned Ford Escape offers as much as 240 horsepower. Blammo!         The CX-5 though weighs a couple of hundred pounds less. May I interest you in some finesse?         I hope so. Because you dont have to understand every facet of Skyactiv to realize that the CX-5 captures some of the driving magic that BMW once held the patent on.         When Ford cut Mazda loose I was curious to see how the dissolution of that relationship would affect the post-breakup Mazdas. It seems the company knows perfectly well what kind of cars it wants to build. Now it just needs the world to notice.   EZRA DYER

The Citation and its General Motors siblings Mr. Spiegel suggested epitomized the ills of American car manufacturing in the 1980s  and the models ultimate failure opened a path for the success of Japanese brands that are todays top sellers.         Mr. Spiegels culinary judgment would prove spot on. His theory about the role this particular model played in the history of the auto industry required a bit more explanation however starting with a review of events that took place in this neighborhood.         From the foot of Beekman Avenue in Sleepy Hollow a suburb 25 miles north of New York City the view stretches across a sprawling empty lot on the east bank of the Hudson River immediately north of the Tappan Zee Bridge. The 99-acre site was once occupied by the General Motors North Tarrytown Assembly plant.         The factory which built Chevrolets and other G.M. vehicles for 81 years closed in 1996 and was razed by 2000. Its crumbling concrete foundation remains an eyesore in an otherwise picturesque setting.         Mr. Spiegel 53 briefly reflected on the effect of the plants closing on the local businesses and residents. And then he offered that a substantial amount of the blame for its demise  along with G.M.s painful march toward Chapter 11 reorganization in 2009  belonged to cars like the two-door hatchback he drives.         Mr. Spiegels Citation a sport-oriented version called the X-11 was not built in North Tarrytown but in Oklahoma City. The plant location mattered little though; the cars proved so troublesome that G.M. stopped making them after six years.         That was also true of its corporate brethren the  Buick Skylark  Oldsmobile Omega and Pontiac Phoenix known collectively as the X-cars based on G.M.s internal designation. The companys fledgling front-wheel-drive compacts introduced for 1980 all suffered myriad problems in their mechanical design and assembly quality. They were recalled repeatedly and incurred customers ire.         Mr. Spiegel who was living on Long Island when the cars were introduced said he was captivated by the Citation X-11 nonetheless. He had considered buying a two-year-old model in 1983 from a dealer in Sayville N.Y. The asking price was $6000 for a well-optioned car that had a window sticker of about $9000 when new.         I had $4000 he said explaining that the car was out of reach. Maybe that was a good thing.         Instead Mr. Spiegel bought a 1979  Ford Mustang . His marriage a few years later and then the birth of twins Adam and Samantha in 1993 took sporty coupes off his radar for years pushing him toward family cars like the Volvo station wagons that he prefers to buy used and an older Lexus that his wife Stacy drives. When family finances have allowed he has enjoyed owning a few just-for-fun cars including a 1968 Cadillac convertible and a 1970 Chevy Camaro neither one in show condition.         Finding a drawing of the X-11 he made while a student at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn  he earned his degree in industrial design there in 1982  rekindled Mr. Spiegels interest. His decades-long affection for the car finally blossomed into a relationship when a friend Cary Sparer helped him find an 81 X-11 for sale last year on Craigslist near Altoona Pa.         After some negotiation Mr. Spiegel bought the car unseen for $1200. He saw his Citation for the first time when it was delivered to his home on a flatbed.         I figured if it was junk Id just get rid of it he said. I was willing to take the chance.         The car appeared to be in good condition with just a few small rust spots. The odometer showed 30000 miles yet Mr. Spiegel was dubious.         It could have been 30000 or 130000 he said. Its hard to tell with these cars because they aged badly and quickly.         The cars V-6 engine it turned out needed to be rebuilt. That cost $2000.

Known by G.M.s internal code as the X-body models or X-cars the four models replaced larger rear-drive sedans that included the popular Chevy Nova.         Built to meet growing demand for more efficient cars and federal regulations mandating higher fuel economy the X-cars represented a daring break from Detroit engineering conventions of the time. This leap contributed to their departure as spectacular failures by the mid-1980s.         Although some 20 inches shorter and 500 pounds lighter than their predecessors the X-cars offered roomier cabins especially in the Citation and Phoenix hatchback body styles; the Skylark and Omega came as two- and four-door sedans. There were two engine choices: a 4-cylinder made by Pontiac and a new Chevrolet-built 2.8-liter V6.         Ford had taken a more conservative approach with its Fairmont compact introduced for 1978 retaining rear-wheel drive and conventional sedan and wagon designs. Chrysler would introduce its K-cars for 1981 the Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliant. Toyotas first front-drive compact the Camry arrived for 1983 with a hatchback profile similar to the Citation.         The automotive press impressed by test drives in factory-prepared X-cars poured on the superlatives: Motor Trend named Citation its Car of the Year. Road & Track gushed This may be the best car to ever come from Detroit. Car and Driver called the cars revolutionary.         The Citation became Americas best-selling car for 1980 with 811000 sold. The spotlight quickly dimmed however. Reports of dreadful assembly quality faulty steering and brakes fuel leaks and other maladies were accompanied by numerous recalls. Citation sales dropped by half for 1981 and the decline steepened from there plummeting to 63000 in 1985 its final model year. The Olds Omega and Pontiac Phoenix were canceled the year before.         G.M. at least acknowledged the problems. An April 1981 news wire story said: F. James McDonald president of the General Motors Corporation says that G.M.s popular X-cars are plagued with uneven doors shabby paint jobs and other problems that do not match the quality standards of foreign competitors.         G.M. would adapt much of the X-car hardware with improvements to build more successful front-drive models. And the X-car V6 engine in various forms powered millions of G.M. vehicles for another three decades.

The crowd-pleasing shade recalled such things as a pumpkin a traffic cone and a hunters vest.         What it didnt remind people of was a Jaguar with several New Yorkers professing love for the car but surprise at its British nameplate. Their reaction was understandable: the 2014 F-Type is Jaguars first pure two-seat sports car in 40 years.         Also like every new Jaguar the F-Type looks and sounds nothing like the genteel coaches that have come to characterize the brand especially after it moved away from racing and sports cars like the E-Type the F-Types classic predecessor of 1961-74.         But if the people on the street couldnt always identify the badge at first glance it didnt stop bystanders from drooling and draping themselves over the Jag sometimes literally: I cringed when I found a group of teenagers engaged in a curbside photo shoot taking turns posing atop the front fender for maximum Flickr effect.         The car has flaws including a relatively steep price flabby curb weight mildly uncommunicative steering and the lack for now of a manual-transmission option. But for an initial salvo against the Porsche 911 Cabriolet and to a lesser extent the  Porsche Boxster  and Corvette Stingray the F-Type made a crater-size impression.         And this British-built roadster reminded me that when a sports car nails the sex sound and speed equation its easy to forgive the little things.         In a bit of reverse colonialism in 2008 Tata Motors of India plucked the Jaguar and Land Rover brands from Ford for $2.3 billion partly to wedge its way into Chinas luxury car market. Of the two marques Land Rover has long carried more than its weight. But critically praised new models are finally giving Jaguar a lift with American sales up 36 percent this year and global sales rising 38 percent.         Befitting its brand name the Jaguar F-Type is a snarling clawing animal  especially in the guise of the supercharged 495-horsepower F-Type V8 S starting at $92895. Thats 40 more horses than the new Stingray 95 more than the 911 Carerra S Cabrio.         A dash from standstill to 60 miles per hour takes just over four seconds with a peak speed of 186 m.p.h. But just as important is how the F-Type gets there and how it returns to a stop: with a such a fusillade of popping backfiring exhaust noise that civilians might dive for cover.         The rumble is faintly ridiculous yes but also inspired and incendiary. It is simply one of the  best V8 engine sounds  in the business aided by a driver-adjustable adaptive exhaust (on V8 and V6 S models) and four artillery-size exhaust outlets.         I didnt drive the V6 S but I have heard it. That cars 380-horsepower 3-liter supercharged engine  has its own sonic charms  along with a lower base price of $81895. Drivers who prize roadster style and fun over sheer velocity can dip down to $69985 for the basic F-Type V6 with a 340-horse version of the supercharged V6.         But theres no getting around it: even that 340-horse starter F-Type costs $13000 more than the 455-horsepower Stingray convertible and nearly $7000 more than the Boxster S.         The 6-cylinder Jaguars are still quick with 0-to-60 times of 5.1 seconds for the base V6 and 4.8 seconds for the V6 S. All three versions share a well-insulated fabric top which I repeatedly popped open while driving around New York City and points north  it operates at speeds up to 30 m.p.h.  during a recent period of spectacular fall weather.         The roof tucks away without stealing space from the petite 7.1-cubic-foot trunk. My large wheeled carry-on just fit with side room to spare. But you can load two carry-ons in the Corvette convertibles roomier hatch and three in the 911 with its front trunk and bonus rear-seat storage.         But people who love the Jags English flair wont be taking a tape measure to the trunk. The cars classic oval grille flared hips and beautifully drawn rear deck  reminiscent of the exotic BMW Z8  push all the right buttons for sports-car fans. Like its modern stablemates this Jaguar looks fast desirable and just a bit dangerous. (A coupe version of the F-Type to be unveiled Nov. 19 at the Los Angeles Auto Show goes on sale in the spring.)         Hidden door handles extend automatically when you unlock the car a nice technical touch. An interior button deploys the rear spoiler at a cocky angle.                Also in Video »

Inside a sweaty mass of latter-day club kids and downtown royalty squeezed past a Barbara Kruger mural brushed up against naked dancers and jostled for cocktails served in faux Campbells Soup cans.         Area the nightclub-as-art-gallery that came to define the creative hedonism of 1980s New York was resurrected for a single night last Tuesday at  the Hole  gallery on the Bowery. The occasion was a new book  Area  a 368-page homage (Abrams) to the over-the-top thematic parties that took place during the clubs storied 1983-to-1987 run.         For people my age it was the first time we can see what Area looked like said Kathy Grayson the owner of the Hole who was accompanied by a little dog.         The show was curated by Jeffrey Deitch and others including the Area alums Eric Goode Jennifer Goode and Serge Becker. Area was of its own time but also way ahead of its time: this convergence of art music performance and fashion Mr. Deitch said.         It was also Mr. Deitchs first exhibition  after leaving the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles  and the party not only evoked the sybaritic spirit of the club but also the fashionable scene cultivated by his gallery in the 1990s and early 2000s.         In addition to Warhol and Kruger the show had rare works by Jean-Michel Basquiat Francesco Clemente Kenny Scharf Keith Haring and others art stars of the 1980s  many created originally for Area. A row of nonworking toilets was also installed prompting plenty of knowing chuckles and Instagram moments. (The exhibition ends Sunday.)         At about 9 p.m. the party moved a block north to the Bowery Hotel where veterans of Area mingled with younger scenesters who werent yet born during its heyday. Only a handful would qualify as real celebrities but in this crowd everyone felt a little famous for having been there.         At one point Calvin Klein showed up standing before a wall of Ronald Reagan posters created for a Hollywood party in 1984. It was a different experience every time Mr. Klein said of the club as he made his way for the exit. You never knew what to expect. It was such a creative moment.         For some the night brought back some of the debauched silliness of 1980s clubbing. Mirrored surfaces were dusted with fake piles of cocaine. Scantily clad performers simulated copulation. Drunken partygoers rolled around the floor.         Mr. Goode who owns the Bowery and several other boutique hotels surveyed the scene from a corner. The late 70s and early 80s were a very special time in New York he said. It was a think tank of artists. The city was very lawless.         He contrasted that to Mayor Michael R. Bloombergs gilded age when community boards night-life task forces and real estate prices have dampened the citys creativity. Places like Area he added would be impossible to pull off today.

320,100000002540522,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,That Rangers Rush,COREY KILGANNON,755,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/nyregion/that-rangers-rush.html,4,Hours before the puck drops at 7:30 in Madison Square Garden waves of energy begin to reach  Buddys Sports Corner  a memorabilia store in the Paramus Park Mall in New Jersey.         The owner Buddy Kurzweil 64 begins to pace. In mere hours his New York Rangers will take their positions on the ice and Buddy the Superfan will take his aisle seat high in the stands.         I dont know if Im their biggest fan but I would say Im the most extreme said Mr. Kurzweil whose pregame ritual has always included driving into Midtown Manhattan at least five hours before game time just to be near the Garden and killing time outside the arena until the game starts.         For the 41 years that Mr. Kurzweil has been a Rangers season ticket holder he has attended nearly every home game. He says he has seen more than 2500 games and has attended every home playoff game since 1971.         My whole life revolves around the Rangers schedule and I cant do anything else  weddings birthdays nothing  if the Rangers are playing said Mr. Kurzweil who while still a toddler living in the Bronx was first mesmerized by Rangers games on the radio and who began going to games with his father at age 6.         Then the family moved to Teaneck N.J. and 9-year-old Buddy began taking the bus into Midtown alone on Sunday nights and walking up to the old Garden at West 50th Street.         When he was about 12 a snowstorm shut down the buses and Buddy walked from our house over the George Washington Bridge to get to a game Mr. Kurzweils mother Thelma recalled.         Two weeks ago Mr. Kurzweil attended his 41st straight home opener against the Montreal Canadiens. As usual he sat in an aisle seat where he serves as unofficial gatekeeper for the row. He is known for not letting anyone enter or leave until play is stopped so as not to interrupt his devotional trance during play.         This summer when a Rangers official called with the news that Mr. Kurzweils seats had been upgraded to a section closer to the ice he was so overcome with emotion that his 26-year-old son Jesse had to take the phone to finish the transaction.         Cathy Mr. Kurzweils wife of 34 years  guess where their first date was  tells the story about Buddy rushing to a Rangers game in Los Angeles and driving four blocks on the sidewalk to avoid a traffic jam.         When they win thats when you ask to borrow money and pay off the credit cards she said adding After a loss he withdraws  I mean hes not violent but you dont want to be around him.         For Rangers road games he sits in his Rangers room a man-cave filled with team memorabilia at his home in Closter N.J. His game chair faces two 50-inch television screens. To his immediate left is the poster-size photograph of the Rangers winning the Stanley Cup in 1994 signed by the teams leader and star Mark Messier (To Buddy  #1 Rangers fan). To his right is a pair of leg pads worn by the Rangers goalie Henrik Lundquist.         He slips his Rangers Stanley Cup ring on his finger and then watches in solitude. Neither Cathy nor Jesse dares intrude. After home games Mr. Kurzweil returns home to the room and watches replays of the game which he always records.         Nothing in life gives me that rush of a live Rangers game he said. Ive never had a cigarette a beer or a drug because the Rangers have always been my drug.         And there was no high like that exalted evening of June 14 1994 when the Rangers won their first Stanley Cup since 1940. Mr. Kurzweil arrived at the Garden entrance at 7 a.m.         It was a day I lived for and dreamt about and waited for my entire life he said. Mr. Kurzweil who earlier in their playoff run so reveled in the teams Game 6 victory over the New Jersey Devils that he went home and watched the third period with a Messier hat trick repeatedly until going to work the next morning.         The championship brought such a windfall of sales Mr. Kurzweil said that he was able to pay off the mortgages on his house and his summer home on the Jersey Shore.         Since then he has never taken off the heavy 24-karat gold Rangers pendant around his neck he said adding I have no plans to.                    The Particulars    Name  Buddy Kurzweil          Age  64          Where Hes From  The Bronx          What He Is  New York Rangers superfan          Telling Detail  Mr. Kurzweil says he owns more than 500 Rangers shirts roughly 100 team jackets every yearbook dating to the 1940s and every program dating to 1927 a year after the team was founded.

In her early years her father then an insurance executive encouraged her to ride his Arabian horses and clean their hooves. She tried but said she hated it and stopped.         Mr. Kampsen now 31 so loved horses that he dropped out of his Tampa high school at 15 to play polo in Wellington Fla. (He later earned his high school equivalency diploma.)         Not that Ms. Solimine had anything against athletes. Im a Jersey Italian girl said Ms. Solimine now 27 and training to be a real estate agent in Palm Beach County. I liked meatheads and muscular jocks  the typical Jersey Shore types. Moreover he was dating a friend of hers.         In the fall of 2004 when she first met Mr. Kampsen a tall skinny redhead during a party at his Wellington home Ms. Solimine then 18 and a Florida Atlantic University freshman said Nothing about him appealed to me.         Her take on him at the time notwithstanding  a classic polo playboy who was always organizing parties  her friendships with her roommate Ngaere Durling and with a friend who happened to be dating Mr. Kampsen led to Ms. Solimines spending weekends accompanying them to horse shows and to Wellington clubs which polo players like Mr. Kampsen frequented after dark.         Despite the sports glittery history and reputation for attracting blue bloods like the Prince of Wales or historic Social Register names like Tommy Hitchcock Jr. theres nothing terribly gentlemanly about playing polo. It can be dangerous. Players sit atop steeds mallets in hand and chase a ball that can be traveling up to 140 miles an hour through the goal  something at which Mr. Kampsen who has a six-goal handicap and plays for a variety of teams  has excelled.         A few months after the other friend broke up with him in 2005 Mr. Kampsen asked her to go to a dinner party. I thought Ali was beautiful Mr. Kampsen said. She seemed smart and worldly and so much fun to be around.         Hed forgotten to R.S.V.P. for the party though and so they arrived to find they were without places at the table. He calmly rounded up two seats but she was mortified she said.         I get worked up over things she explained. I felt uncomfortable with him.         But he was warming to her and quickly. I had dated nothing but preppy girls he said. Ali was different saying funny things and speaking her mind about everything. And she had long fingernails like JWoww from the Jersey Shore show.         Soon after he sent her a text asking her to dinner and a movie. I didnt realize that Kris was actually a gentleman with a soft side and a love for food she said.         That night they talked nonstop with no lapses. She had acted so tough he said but I could tell that underneath her shell she was really a sweet and loving girl.         They started spending part of each day together as friends at the beach at concerts at his events building the relationship. As Ms. Durling recalled Although they didnt seem to have a lot in common Kris and Ali loved being together.         One night when just the two were hanging out at his house he kissed her. She felt awkward however and quickly drove off. I was getting more attracted but still in denial said Ms. Solimine whose focus was firmly on fashion design and finishing college. As much as I disliked being around horses and barns I could not believe I was in any kind of relationship with someone who loved that scene.         Then came the large 24th birthday bash in January 2006 that she gave for Mr. Kampsen who had not stopped pursuing her. In front of the guests he planted a sizzling kiss on the hostess who for once responded with gusto. I felt sparks she said. We were best friends who became romantic that night. I was really taken with his self-confidence loyalty to his friends and ability to handle me.                Also in T Magazine »       
322,100000002538472,0,Article,News,Real Estate,realestate,,"Bonus Work Space, Right in the Lobby",C. J. HUGHES,1453,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/realestate/bonus-work-space-right-in-the-lobby.html,1,Pity the poor cubicle: modern-day workers seem to prefer any other place to these narrow partitioned-off desks.         Like overstuffed chairs in coffee shops. Or long tables in hotel lobbies. Even narrow cafe counters suffice in elbow-to-elbow conditions as long as they are close to sockets.         And as offices get de-Dilbert-ized developers are taking notice.         In addition to offering the usual amenity spaces they have begun enlarging their lobbies to create welcoming work zones for the share of the nations 42 million self-employed people who live in New York.         Found mostly in rental buildings that cater to a younger crowd and in trendsetting enclaves outside  Manhattan  these lounges bear more than a passing resemblance to the  Ace Hotel  that pioneering round-the-clock hipster hangout in NoMad and other boutique lodgings.         The lounges often feature a hotels-worth of freebies: Wi-Fi coffee and even hardcover thrillers to thumb through during breaks.         Renters do pay more for the privilege of an elevator-ride commute. But developers are betting that once they take to the upstairs-downstairs live-work dynamic they will not only rent in the building but stay for years.         If you invest a little bit more in these community areas they will pay major dividends said Omri Sachs a principal of  Adam America Real Estate  which worked with the Horizon Group in developing 53 Broadway a new rental in Williamsburg  Brooklyn  with a 1000-square-foot lounge of this type.         Mr. Sachs didnt have to go far to learn that his neighborhood was chockablock with people who dont shuttle off to Manhattan for 9-to-5 jobs. The restaurant next door Marlow and Sons for instance seems to have a crowd lolling about all day. Research trips to Tobys Estate a coffee shop and the Wythe Hotel taught Mr. Sachs similar lessons he said.         In styling 53 Broadway he also borrowed these spots industrial-rustic looks with brick walls concrete floors and bare bulbs plus long shelves of dust-jacket-less novels by Clive Cussler and other authors.         As far as the price of the dÃ©cor in this entirely new building Mr. Sachs paid $300000; in carving out the space he had to sacrifice some potential sidewalk-level retail space too.         But a few months after 53 Broadways opening brokers say the decision already seems to have been worth it. On most weekday mornings in the 74-unit building two or three people are sitting in the lounge pecking at computers making use of the free Wi-Fi said Brian Lentini a senior project manager with  aptsandlofts.com  the brokerage handling leasing. Most dont stay a full day he said but these visits stave off cabin fever. A change of scenery is important Mr. Lentini said.         The building whose one-bedrooms start at $3100 a month with one month free as a deal-sweetener opened in August and is 92 percent leased he added.         At  34 Berry  a 142-unit rental on the other side of Williamsburg that opened in 2010 the landlord is trying even harder to create a cafe-by-the-concierge effect.         Coffee courtesy of a Starbucks machine that dispenses 8- and 12-ounce cups is free from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. People say I can save $5 a day by being hereÂ  said Jason Allison the buildings manager on a recent tour. Its one of those feel-good experiences that adds value.         The narrow carpeted space is not as roomy as an actual Starbucks. But in this building with mostly studios where rents start at $2200 and where a fifth of residents are estimated to be freelancers working from home even a little extra legroom can help Mr. Allison added.         On a recent workday Emily Malan a photographer was sitting on a stool at a glass-topped table in the lounge taking advantage of free Wi-Fi on her laptop. Though Ms. Malan moved into her studio several months ago she still hadnt set up Internet access and as it has been so convenient to email from the lounge she may never get around to it she said. The rent is pretty high here she added so these amenities are a nice added bonus.         In a sense  LCOR  34 Berrys owner got lucky. When the company took control of the site after a condo project there failed the space that now contains the lounge had been intended for a superintendents apartment according to David Sigman an executive vice president of LCOR.         From a zoning perspective the switch to common space was a no-brainer. Under a 1980s housing incentive program indoor recreation space doesnt count toward the volume permitted under floor-to-area ratio calculations according to both Planning Department sources and Mr. Sigman. The rule is meant to encourage developers to put lounges above ground where there is a better likelihood of natural light rather than in dark basements they said.         The lounge has been so successful Mr. Sigman said that LCOR is replicating it nearby at 250 North 10th Street its glassy new $100 million rental whose 234 units are to open in January.

323,100000002542624,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,Against Disclosure,DAVID M. PRIMO,828,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/against-disclosure.html,7,IN the policy world corporate disclosure is widely seen as an unalloyed good. Publicly traded corporations are under growing pressure to reveal more information about C.E.O. compensation political spending and even the dangers that climate change poses for the company.         Shareholders need such information advocates say in order to hold managers accountable and reduce risks to the company and its reputation. Democracy itself the argument continues benefits when voters know more about how corporations operate.         But a number of recent studies including some of my own suggest that this view is shortsighted. Disclosure though frequently valuable often leads to adverse unintended consequences that can outweigh its benefits.         Groups like the  Center for Political Accountability  that favor greater disclosure often cite the experience of Target. In 2010 Target to comply with a disclosure law made public its contribution to a pro-business group called MN Forward. Gay rights activists then led boycotts and store protests of Target because MN Forward supported the pro-business Minnesota candidate for governor Tom Emmer who also opposed gay marriage.         While disclosure advocates embrace this episode as the comeuppance of a company that had something to hide I think a different lesson might be drawn. Targets political spending was almost certainly on balance in line with the interests of the corporation. You cant pick and choose the positions of your candidate and Target was contributing to MN Forward not the candidate directly. But by using information obtained as a result of a disclosure law activists were able to manufacture a problem for Target that disrupted its operations.         Other sorts of disclosure like the Securities and Exchange Commission-mandated financial reporting by publicly traded companies can alter the incentives of corporate managers in counterproductive ways. In a  working paper  released by the National Bureau of Economic Research in September the researchers Alex Edmans Mirko Heinle and Chong Huang used a theoretical model to show that mandated disclosure leads corporate managers to prefer decisions that produce favorable verifiable information  like taking steps to increase short-term profits  over actions that may be better for the company in the long run but do not produce easily measurable data like creating an environment that fosters innovation.         You might suspect that the benefits of disclosure far exceed any such costs. But my colleague Saumya Prabhat and I have found empirical evidence to the contrary. In recently conducted research we studied the consequences of a 2000 law in Britain that required greater disclosure  and even shareholder approval  of corporate political spending. Because some disclosure was required before 2000 we were able to obtain data on which companies were politically active and which were not. Using a statistical method to isolate the effect of the law we looked at the three years before the law went into effect and the three years afterward to see how politically active and inactive companies changed.         We found that after the law went into effect politically active businesses in Britain did not see changes in stock price volatility (a common measure of financial risk) that differed from those of their politically inactive counterparts. Any benefits to shareholders provided by the law were counterbalanced by its costs.         But you might be thinking who cares about shareholders? Its democracy that we should be worried about. Political scientists often argue that the citizenry benefits if it knows for example about corporate spending on ballot measures on which it is preparing to vote. (If you are critical of oil companies and an oil company spends money in favor of an initiative that may be all you need to know to cast a no vote.)         But in  an experiment  whose results I published in the Election Law Journal I found that this wasnt necessarily so. I separated participants into three groups that received differing amounts of information about a hypothetical ballot measure regarding taxation and immigration policy. A control group saw the wording that appeared on the ballot; a second group saw the wording and was also given access to news accounts advertisements and a voter guide summarizing the pro and con positions; and a third group could view all of this information as well as campaign-finance disclosure data integrated into news stories. The material provided to the second and third groups explicitly mentioned the positions of various interests including corporations.         All three groups of voters were then asked to identify the positions of the various interests on the ballot measure. (They did not know they would be asked to do this.) Remarkably participants in the third group who viewed the disclosure-related information did no better than other respondents (controlling for other material participants viewed). In other words once you account for everything available to voters campaign-finance disclosure provides very little informational benefit.         For too long disclosure has been viewed as the policy equivalent of a free lunch  all benefit and no cost. Disclosure is not always a bad thing. But it is not always a good thing either.         David M. Primo  is an associate professor of political science and business administration at the University of Rochester.

324,100000002542441,0,Article,News,Fashion & Style,fashion,,Tailgating Gets Online Playbooks,NANCY M. BETTER,768,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/fashion/tailgating-gets-online-playbooks-with-websites-and-apps.html,13,The coleslaw was the culprit. After receiving several dozen emails discussing who would bring the coleslaw to a football tailgate party at Washington & Lee University in Lexington Va. Caroline Hundley was losing her patience.         Every week it was the same thing said Ms. Hundley a Dallas resident and mother of Hal Hundley a nose tackle on the schools football team. All 87 families on the team would announce what they were bringing to the game and hit reply all so my inbox would be inundated.         Not anymore. Last fall Ms. Hundley signed up the entire team for  ourtailgate.com  a free tool that allows users to organize events invite participants assign duties and send reminders. The website was created by Harry St. John a former college athlete who wanted to take the agony out of managing tailgates.         The traditional method of planning a tailgate is highly inefficient said Mr. St. John who works at a Manhattan advertising technology firm. People dont know what to bring or how much to bring. Its not clear whos supposed to set up or clean up. This way everyone can see whos coming whats needed and whats already been taken care of.         Ms. Hundleys favorite feature is the automatic reminder which notifies tailgaters of their responsibilities 24 hours before game time. Now the process is much easier and much less annoying she said.         Already 100000 people have established accounts with ourtailgate.com and the number is rapidly increasing. This comes as no surprise to Joe Cahn who is working with the University of South Carolinas sports marketing department to compile tailgating statistics. According to Mr. Cahn tailgaters spend more than $20 billion annually including food beverages and gear.         I call it the last great American neighborhood said Mr. Cahn who operates a website  tailgating.com  that offers recipes and tips to sports fans. Tailgating inspires a real sense of community.         Plenty of entrepreneurs are hoping to cash in on this community. A growing number of websites are catering to fans of Americas fastest growing sport as Tailgater Monthly an online magazine refers to it. Many sell products created for tailgaters.  Americantailgater.com  offers the Fan Brand Grilling Iron ($12.95) which allows fans to brand steaks with their favorite teams logo.  Insidetailgating.com  showcases the Scorzie a score-keeping beverage holder ($15); and Brewsees sunglasses ($29.99) with a built-in bottle opener.         In addition to websites a variety of GPS-enabled apps geared to tailgaters have sprung up. On game day fans can use Stadium Finder (free on Android) to locate the playing field and Tailgate Scout (free on iPhone or Android) to find out exactly where their friends are in the parking lot. In case of inclement weather (or lack of tickets) fans can use Sports Bar Finder (free on iPhone or Android) to locate the nearest bar or restaurant equipped with DirecTV showing their favorite team.         A pair of apps for organizing tailgates Tailgating (free on iPhone) and Tailgating Planner ($1 on Android) have also been started. These apps allow users to create checklists and share them via Bluetooth.         Not everyone thinks this degree of specialization is necessary. Kimberly Purcell a professional organizer in Folsom Calif. recommends tools such as Evernote or Google Drive to organize tailgate parties rather than customized products. The vast majority of apps are used only once she said. Youre better off with tools that can be in your life for multiple uses.         Lately tailgating has attracted academic as well as commercial attention. In a research study titled A Cultural Analysis of Tailgating John Sherry a University of Notre Dame marketing professor and anthropologist likens tailgating to traditional harvest celebrations in ancient Greece and Rome which involved excessive feasting and drinking and required generous hospitality toward strangers and guests.         Professor Sherry dubs tailgating a vestaval after Vesta the goddess of the hearth. As in ancient times people celebrate the massive abundance of the season while they can he said. The football season starts at the end of summer goes through fall and ends on winters doorstep. Tailgating is an autumnal rite that celebrates abundance in the face of austerity.         Professor Sherry applauds the use of technology in organizing cultural rituals including tailgates. People want to be involved in a very participatory way and technology makes more room for this to happen he said.         For their study Professor Sherry and his colleagues traveled around the United States employing ethnographic research methods to analyze tailgating rituals at college stadiums. One observation he offered: A lot of people who tailgate dont actually go to the game. For them football is secondary. Its the communal celebration that matters most.                Also in T Magazine »       
325,100000002542547,0,Article,News,Fashion & Style,fashion,,"On Nicolas Ghesquière, and Sweatpants",CATHY HORYN,697,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/fashion/Cathy-Horyn-on-Nicolas-Ghesquire-Choice-by-Louis-Vuitton.html,11,MY OBSESSION THESE DAYS is to find a decent pair of sweatpants. And by decent I mean particular: not too skinny perhaps something in a fine knit (ribbing is O.K.) and definitely not anything pooling at my ankles. Im willing to pay a lot of money for my dream sweats not a fortune but certainly I can do better than Modells.         I was thinking about my quest in relation to  Nicolas GhesquiÃ¨re s appointment as creative director of womens design at Louis Vuitton. I know I know: fat chance. Hes hardly a sweatpants kind of guy. He dressed his friend Kristen Stewart in graffiti-squiggle trousers. ChloÃ« Sevigny probably owes her entire career as a radical style chick to his early designs at Balenciaga. He put the planet on skyscraper platforms.         This was back in 2006. I remember the day well. A pair arrived at the office for a photo shoot and I thought: What can it hurt? Ill try them on. Had a crane been available to hoist me up on those babies Im sure ChloÃ« and I would have been friends today.         The news reports of Mr. GhesquiÃ¨res appointment coolly noted that it was expected and further that it was part of a broad strategic effort on the part of Louis Vuitton which makes billions selling handbags. But what does that have to do with my sweatpants?         Well in a way everything.         Lets deal with the first part. Why was the hire expected? Because the luxury-goods business doesnt care for risk. It likes a known quantity and while Mr. GhesquiÃ¨re is a daring designer with a curiosity for the new especially futuristic fabrics he fits comfortably with LVMHs idea of high-powered blow-the-bank showmanship. He will deliver what executives want which in part is a continuation of the values that Marc Jacobs the former Vuitton creative head represented.         By comparison Burberrys decision last month to give Christopher Bailey the responsibilities of both creative director and chief executive is truly risky. Such a thing has never been done before. Even though Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani run their own ships they have long had chief executives.         One of the challenges that Mr. Bailey will no doubt face is how he will get along in a large company like Burberry without a partner which he has had in Angela Ahrendts the outgoing chief executive and her predecessor Rose Marie Bravo. Strong or not it helps to share your thoughts with another person.         Still the Bailey decision represents a break from institutional thinking and that is no small thing in an industry frantic with self-doubt behind its superior mask.         Now for the second part: the whippoorwill call of strategic initiatives. This sounds more exciting than it really is. Most luxury-goods companies if they are cautious as both LVMH and its rival Kering are have figured out that demand for expensive products isnt all that elastic. They can open stores in new markets but because of a bunch of factors including competition and the rapid spread of information resulting in bored-to-death consumers they find that growth starts to slow.         And this process seems to happen at a faster and faster rate so that before long everyone is pointing to an entire country and saying Well its finished.         One solution has been to effectively turn fashion into a gated community by making products more expensive and exclusive (at least marketing them that way). Oddly I dont know many people connected with the industry  designers editors behind-the-scenes staff members  who hold the view that fashion should follow the global economic divide of haves and have-nots. We certainly dont dress that way ourselves.         Nonetheless the industry expresses this outlook  in its language in its elaborate craft-oriented products as though the handmade were also something infinitely beyond human reach.         Well it makes a decent pair of sweatpants seem almost bold.         Dont get me wrong: I think Mr. GhesquiÃ¨re is a great choice for Louis Vuitton. At his worst he is more interesting than most designers of his generation and at his best he makes you think. I certainly wouldnt mind if he did something utterly contradictory at Louis Vuitton. In fact its time.

He arranged his unsteady hands  he had Parkinsons since 2009  so that he could view the leaves Technicolor contrast against blue sky. Now when you remove the frame dont they look different from before?         Capturing life through a viewfinder to see it more clearly even brilliantly was what Mr. Pincus had long been known for first as  a Direct Cinema pioneer  documenting a struggling black community in the South during the civil rights movement ( Black Natchez  1967) and later as one of the earliest filmmakers to turn the camera on himself and his relationships including his then-open marriage in Diaries (1982).         Like the first-person documentarians who followed him including Ross McElwee and Alan Berliner Mr. Pincus used film as a medium for creation a vehicle for perception and a tool for living.         During a visit to Vermont six weeks before  he died on Tuesday  Mr. Pincus discussed his latest work One Cut One Life directed with Lucia Small 50 and how it attempted the same but with themes that are especially complex and intimate. In December 2009 one of Ms. Smalls closest friends the artist Susan Woolf was murdered. Seven weeks later another close friend the film editor Karen Schmeer her roommate on the Upper West Side of Manhattan was killed by a driver who was fleeing the police. Then in 2011 Mr. Pincus was told he had the blood disease myelodysplastic syndrome which progressed to leukemia. Doctors had predicted he wouldnt live past March.         One Cut One Life is ostensibly about how the two filmmakers cope with death in its sudden and protracted forms but it is something else as well: a meta-exploration of their collaboration itself and how they both used personal filmmaking to deal with the difficulties of life.         I wanted to make this documentary for many reasons one being that film helps contain the pain of the world  it distills it for me Ms. Small said. Another is memory. In three weeks will we remember that tree? Memories fade. But film captures moments so that they dont.         Despite the heavy themes both directors emphasized that One Cut One Life was about living life well. My main resistance was not another documentary about someone dyingÂ  Mr. Pincus said. What a bore.         I wasnt interested in making that film either Ms. Small said. I wanted to make a film told from two points of view.         She was taking a break from editing in a converted shed on Mr. Pincuss farm here. She sat on a deck chair while Mr. Pincus sat on his porch steps. Speaking with the pair opened a nonstop volley of perspectives as they complemented explained and gently contradicted each other. A Brooklyn-born philosophy major Mr. Pincus described his approach as ironic distancing and that of Ms. Small a Californian drawn to film for its potential to do good as more engaged.         Their first collaboration  The Axe in the Attic  (2007) was a self-reflective journey to New Orleans to bear witness to the impact of  Hurricane Katrina . As they interview devastated families the directors reveal their own responses and sense of powerlessness.         The emotional effects of making that film strained their relationship. But after the deaths of her friends Mr. Pincus suggested that she pick up a camera but not necessarily make a film he said. She largely resisted until his diagnosis then made a counterproposal that they make a film together. He said he would film her for two days but that she should lock the footage away for 10 years.         That last concept didnt take hold even though it had a strong precedent. In 1971 while teaching at M.I.T. Mr. Pincus set out to film his life for five years and then not look at the results for another five years after that. The upshot was Diaries.         As documented in that film one of Mr. Pincuss associates Dennis Sweeney became mentally unstable and increasingly threatening prompting Mr. Pincus and his wife Jane an artist and a co-author of Our Bodies Our Selves to leave Boston and take their two children to Vermont. (Mr. Sweeney  later murdered  the political activist Allard Lowenstein in 1980.) Eventually Mr. Pincus gave up filmmaking and discovered flower farming. But as he wrote in a journal at the time without filmmaking he had lost part of my soul.         In 2003 a film festival invitation led to his meeting  Ms. Small . We just clicked she said.         Mr. Pincus suggested they work together. By making Axe in the Attic Ms. Small helped pull Ed out of retirement Mr. McElwee said.         In One Cut One Life Mr. Pincus recalls how as a boy he imagined what it would have been like to have only one day to live and whether he would have chosen to live differently. I was sure I would he said And I wouldnt wear my galoshes even if it were raining. But if he had more time say a month would it be different? he asks.         Mr. Pincus said that making One Cut One Life had helped extend that finite period of living without his galoshes. He described experiencing the joy of the camera as he filmed at Third Branch Flower his idyllic farm.         One Cut One Life also brought Mr. Pincus back to familiar thematic territory from Diaries as his personal connection with Ms. Small threatened to alienate his wife. Mrs. Pincuss raw responses captured on film to affectionate exchanges between the directors revealed one dimension of no-holds-barred first-person filmmaking. We were very interested in capturing intimacy and closeness Ms. Small said. And we were surprised by how intimate it became.         Mr. Pincus walked through his kitchen gingerly  he was due for his weekly platelet transfusion the next day  and stole a warm embrace from Mrs. Pincus. Ms. Small was eager to get to the editing room. They had a deadline Ms. Small said  Mr. Pincus laughed at her wording  to get the film ready for festivals.         He pointed out a slow-falling leaf that was temporarily lifted by the wind. The gift of terminal diagnosis was that it opened me to the world he said. And it gave Lucia an opportunity to hold on.                Also in T Magazine »       
327,100000002536660,0,Article,Review,Arts,arts,music,"Sounds of Senegal, San Francisco and Beyond",BEN RATLIFF,672,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/arts/music/music-from-mar-seck-wooden-shjips-and-simona-premazzi.html,22, Mar Seck   VAGABONDE         The kite string tethering the floating music on the album Vagabonde is  Mar Secks  voice one of the greatest in the Senegalese music of the 1970s and worth a closer listen. Mr. Seck worked with some of the top bands in Senegal: the Star Band de Dakar Number One de Dakar Etoile de Dakar. (His tenures in some of those groups overlapped with the singer Youssou NDour who went on to become an international superstar and the great guitarist BarthÃ©lÃ©my Attisso who later joined Orchestra Baobab.) Vagabonde released by the Senegalese label Teranga Beat collects unreleased recordings from three sessions: one in 1969 the very beginning of his career with the band Super Cap-Vert from Rufisque his hometown near Dakar; one with the Star Band in 1973; and the last with Number One recorded live in 1980. In general terms the music is a crossing of Congolese rumba Ghanaian high life and Cuban and Puerto Rican dance bands. These were the years when Afro-Cuban music had become important to Senegalese nightclub culture and the lyrics were as often in Spanish as in Wolof. The early recordings have a dusty echoey sound  intensely evocative  that will make you wonder about unconscious affinities: Mexican ranchera? Dominican bachata? The late ones are more up-tempo slick and swirly. The middle ones are the killers sturdy and regal forthrightly Afro-Latin. Mr. Seck was a great singer of love songs and his carefully modulated tenor voice doesnt burn with the wattage of Mr. NDours; its always gentle and reasonable no matter the circumstances.          Wooden Shjips   BACK TO LAND         From San Francisco the psychedelic-rock band  Wooden Shjips  works on a very old model: Back to Land (Thrill Jockey) its fourth album proceeds as if everyone had unlimited time and patience and no music required hooks or extramusical binding concepts. It sounds deeply comfortable being derivative; it has no anxiety. Its a battened-down record: one groove per song; very few chord changes but clear shifts toward choruses; slow wave-form phase effects; light and mumbled monotone vocals; organ chords held down fast; solos built of small clear melodic notions. But Back to Land is also centered and relaxed and open almost pastoral. Its music conceived for interior spaces but influenced by open-air ones.          Simona Premazzi   THE LUCID DREAMER         A young Italian jazz pianist  Simona Premazzi  has been playing gigs steadily in New York since 2007 or so and performing with Greg Osbys quartet more recently. Her third album The Lucid Dreamer a quartet record including the saxophonist Melissa Aldana has just been released by Mr. Osbys label Inner Circle. Shes bringing a lot to the table. Her composing style stays modern without ever being airless and swing-deficient open without getting lost in harmony and sentimentality; idea driven but so much that the listener needs explanations. (Although in Love Is Not All she forms melodic piano phrases aligning with Edna St. Vincent Millays voice reading her poem of that name  an idea that Jason Moran used in Ringing My Phone.) And her soloing is special: Shes picking up on a complex heavily rhythmic and idiosyncratic tradition that goes back to stride piano and runs through Thelonious Monk and Andrew Hill. Her solos move in fits and starts flowing and abrupt always interesting.          Cian Nugent & The Cosmos   BORN WITH THE CAUL         The Irish guitarist  Cian Nugent  sounds as if hes entirely absorbed the prescient droney traditionalism of American guitarists in the 1960s like John Fahey and Sandy Bull but hes taking it forward into his own hybridized areas: chamber music jazz psychedelia bluegrass and what people who used to visit record stores might call postrock. Born With the Caul (No Quarter) his highly accomplished second album and his first with a band winds around a lot within each long multipart song taking its time and growing progressively more agitated beginning with the fingerpicked acoustic guitar of Grass Above My Head and ending in the wild 23-minute Houses of Parliament with fully electric power chords and distortion.

Ms. Slate 31 rose to national attention in 2009 as a featured player on Saturday Night Live; she accidentally swore on camera during her debut sketch. Leaving the show after one season after her contract was not renewed she regrouped with  Marcel the Shell With Shoes On  a stop-motion short about a sweetly optimistic little mollusk with sneakers created with her husband and frequent collaborator Dean Fleischer-Camp. That cult hit yielded a sequel and a picture book; another short film and book are underway along with a full-length independent movie.         Ms. Slate also has a recurring role on Showtimes House of Lies and recently completed a script for a Looney Tunes reboot by Warner Bros.         A recent transplant to Los Angeles she returns to her first love stand-up and former home Brooklyn on Sunday to  headline  a showcase at  Littlefield  for the close of the New York Comedy Festival. Candid and effusively cheerful Ms. Slate spoke to Stacey Anderson by phone from California. Here are excerpts from their conversation.          Q. How does stand-up fit into your career goals?    A.  I like to express myself in that way but Im not sure how much I care about making that into my lifes line of work. Really I like being an actress. And I like saying actress and not actor. I really like being a woman performer.          Are you using your English and comparative literature education from Columbia?   You know what? I am. The things that I was interested in ranged from 20th-century poetry to plagues in Dickensian London. Infectious diseases I loved for some reason.          Nothings funnier than infectious diseases.   I was like Smallpox and cholera  this is invigorating! I use my education a lot because I tend to make fun of the things that I love. Like any book thats kind of like A Room With a View where theres a young female protagonist whos about to have a sexual awakening and just cannot handle it.          How was working with Amy Poehler on Parks and Recreation?    I think everybody on that show is so happy because shes so uniquely kind. When I did swear on SNL I got into work on Monday and there was a beautiful orchid on my desk. It was from Amy [who had recently left SNL] and there was a note that said Youre a class act. That is one of the nicest things that anybody has ever done for me because I was really scared and I didnt know what was going to happen to me.           Marcel the Shell came about around the same time as SNL.   I wasnt fired yet. I knew I was going to be. I felt myself starting to become a bit watered down and sluggish and hard on myself in a way that is not helpful. And I started to talk in a little voice and my husband noticed it. He was like: You need to remember that youre a creative person no matter what your job is. Youve been a creative person forever so continue to do that. You dont need to wait for permission from a television show that doesnt understand you.          Which Looney Tunes character do you identify with most?   I think Im kind of a Daffy-PepÃ© Le Pew hybrid but my husband tells me Im a lot like this little mouse called the  Blabber Mouse . He talks a lot.                Also in T Magazine »       
329,100000002536616,0,Article,News,Arts,arts,television,Animal House (Republican Style),DAVID CARR,1587,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/arts/television/alpha-house-amazons-original-series-years-in-the-making.html,20,Alpha House the  first  original series from Amazon may be about four fictional scandal-clad senators living in a group house in Washington but verisimilitude is a foundational element. The Russell Senate Office Building has been painstakingly recreated at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens right down to the hideaways and mail slots. And while there are quite a few other shows set in the milieu of Beltway politics there is none other in which Barack Obama is president and Mitch McConnell is the Senate minority leader as they are here. But there is one dead giveaway that we are not in the version of Washington that we read about every day: The Republicans and Democrats on  Alpha House  actually speak to one another.         John Goodman plays Gil John Biggs a basketball coach turned Republican senator who is under attack from the right by a Tea Party candidate. One of his housemates Senator Robert Bettencourt played by Clark Johnson comes under investigation by the Senate ethics committee which is run by Carly Armiston a strident Democrat played by Cynthia Nixon. In the Senate dining room as Senator Biggs tries to send over a fancy bottle of wine a waiter named Lloyd tells him She thinks you are up to something Senator.         I am up to somethin Lloyd. Comity.         Comedy? Lloyd says.         Comity! Senator Biggs says. Means gettin along with the other side. He and his sworn political enemy eventually share frank conversation and far too much wine.         The reason the scene works as comedy is that it sounds so far-fetched but there are other reasons Alpha House has a shot at finding the funny. Garry Trudeau the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist of Doonesbury conceived and wrote the series and it stars Mr. Goodman who played big and fun on the sitcom Roseanne. He brings a darkly comedic reputation from his film work with the Coen Brothers as well thanks to characters like the Dudes wingman in The Big Lebowski. Mr. Goodman has a role in the coming Coen Brothers film Inside Llewyn Davis but said he has his reasons for saying yes to Alpha House.         Im working in New York which I love he said. I am doing a show with Garry Trudeau and we are doing something that hasnt been done before.         It both has and it hasnt. For Amazon it is certainly a first. The first three episodes will become available Friday to all Amazon customers and then a new episode will be available each week thereafter to Amazon Prime members. Given that Alpha House is a series set in contemporary Washington and delivered on the web  not through broadcast or cable  comparisons to Netflixs House of Cards are bound to crop up though this doesnt seem to concern Mr. Trudeau at all.         Thats a drama and we are making a comedy he said by phone. But I was as startled as anyone about the impact that House of Cards made. It certainly came out with a roar and I found it very watchable and engaging. Mr. Trudeau conceived Alpha House about five years ago but it ended up in a drawer until he and Jonathan Alter the journalist and author were on a road trip for the 2012 New Hampshire primary when Mr. Alter convinced him that there was room in the market for a funny well-told comedy about politics. Mr. Alter brought the show to Amazon and now serves as an executive producer along with Elliot Webb and Mr. Trudeau spending much of his time making sure the show nails the details of Beltway life. Mr. Alter said that coming behind House of Cards which won a directing Emmy for its creator David Fincher is a happy coincidence.         I think what happened with House of Cards is great for our show Mr. Alter said standing in one of the Senate offices on set. It legitimized online viewing and lets people know that there is quality programming on the web.         For Mr. Goodman it feels like well a television show.         Its all the same to me he said shadowboxing with a door frame as he warmed up for a scene. The distribution is out of my control.         Speaking of which Bill Murray played a disgraced senator who was hauled off to jail in the pilot. He has been tough to pin down since.         He is scheduled to be in the final episode but he keeps us on our toes because its never quite clear whats going on in Bills world Mr. Trudeau said. We call him The Unicorn. We think he actually gets to the set by magical thinking. (He actually drove himself there for an early morning call during the pilot shoot surprising everyone when he walked in.)

330,100000002536720,0,Article,News,Arts,arts,television,Familiar Drama Shines Among Guts and Gore,MIKE HALE,1066,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/arts/television/the-good-wife-stands-out-among-newer-fall-shows.html,21,Watching the latest fall television season unfold since September Ive been struck by two things neither of them happy.         One is that this season more than ever the most basic effect of Sept. 11 on popular entertainment is clear: the casual depiction of torture and mass murder as an easy way to spice up a drama Hamburger Helper for the busy show runner. From a C.I.A. officer twisting a suspects broken leg in The Blacklist to a New Orleans socialite conducting gruesome weirdly sexualized experiments on her slaves in American Horror Story: Coven; from teenagers being terrorized in Hostages to the hospitalization and abduction of Carrie Mathison in Homeland violent coercion has become as common a plot device as overhearing a phone call or running out of gas.         The other  perhaps connected to the first  is that no new network show has emerged as an obvious keeper the way The Good Wife did in 2009 and Nashville did last year. Things may not be as bad as they were in 2010  which gave us by my count only six surviving network series the best of which is probably the Fox cartoon Bobs Burgers  but its hard to remember a set of new shows that felt this unmemorable.         Thats not good news for the broadcast networks when theyre engaged in a desperate war with cable and the Internet over viewers and dollars. (To be fair some new shows including The Blacklist on NBC Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC and The Millers on CBS have achieved decent Nielsen ratings.) And that competition may be to blame for some of the ponderous humorless flavor that the new broadcast season exhibits.         The networks have been openly copying strategies cable dramas have used on the way to critical and in the case of  The Walking Dead  commercial domination: short seasons and limited runs (The Following on Fox Under the Dome on CBS Dracula on NBC) and boundary-pushing violence and viciousness (Hannibal on NBC and The Following). But at this point it doesnt appear that they can compete on those terms.          Hostages  on CBS is meant to be a high-concept event series along cable lines but over seven episodes its become the biggest hoot of the new season. (Rivals for that title include ABCs Betrayal NBCs Dracula and CWs Reign.) It started with the premise that the family of a famous surgeon (Toni Collette) was taken prisoner to force her to kill the president in a plot with double and triple layers of conspiracy. But that idea seems to have been abandoned for now at least as the show has evolved into a turgid hilariously implausible melodrama about how a dysfunctional family bonds while being beaten shot followed insulted and operated on without anesthesia.         The problem may well be that a short-run conspiracy thriller is much harder to execute under the network pilot system than the looser schedules allowed by cable development. When the actress Nina Arianda showed up as the surgeons sister and amazed by the weird behavior of everyone in the house shouted Hello why isnt anyone listening to me? she was the perfect audience surrogate.         The Blacklist has been one of the seasons ratings success stories probably owing in part to the popularity of the star James Spader. But its emphasis on high body counts  50 in a train derailment here 30 in a gassed subway car there  and the theatrical flourishes of Mr. Spaders character a possibly reformed master criminal cant hide that the show is as contrived unconvincing and clichÃ©-ridden as any of the crime and spy dramas on the summer schedules of TNT and USA.         Unfortunately The Blacklist doesnt have the qualities  sexiness breeziness warmth  that make those cable shows mindlessly watchable. The real shame though is that the phoniness of Mr. Spaders character seems to have seeped into his one-note carnival-act performance.         It may make sense that the most palatable and promising of the new network dramas so far is the one with the most resolutely commercial big-business low-culture provenance:  Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  It is in some measure what the other shows arent: clever funny stylish with characters we care about and not insignificantly more convincing special effects. And while other shows have bigger names the most satisfying performance in a new network series is probably being given by Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson resolute and recently dead leader of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team.

331,100000002535695,0,Article,News,Arts,arts,television,"2-Way Chemistry, Crackle to Fizzle",NEIL GENZLINGER,1045,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/arts/television/new-tv-series-powered-by-pairs-for-better-or-worse.html,21,Do they click? Do their characters mesh and can viewers stand to spend time with them? A lot can go into whether a television show succeeds  time slot subject matter budget  but sometimes a series rises or falls on the strength of two pivotal actors. And this seasons new shows offer illuminating examples.         Series with a crucial pairing can be televisions version of a two-hander  Cagney & Lacey Laverne & Shirley Psych or any other show with plenty of characters but only two who really matter. The reigning example may be Bones the Fox crime procedural starring David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel as an opposites-attract investigative team. The series and its stars took some time to hone a working formula yet now nine seasons in with the lead characters in a personal as well as professional relationship Bones seems as comfortable as old slippers.         But crucial pairings dont have to be romantic and they dont have to be in a two-character show. Would Star Trek have endured had William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy not found a way to sell the odd exchanges between Kirk and Spock?         This falls season has brought an assortment of shows that put a lot of weight on the shoulders of two actors. Some are getting it right some arent. Heres a sampling:          WORKING NICELY  The improbable description of Foxs  Sleepy Hollow  made it seem a novelty entry at best. Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison) wakes up in the 21st century and finds that the headless horseman  one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse  is there too. Crane forms an alliance with a sheriffs deputy Abbie Mills (Nicole Beharie) to battle the malevolent forces that have been unleashed.         Mr. Mison and Ms. Beharie and the people writing their dialogue have elevated this premise from the B-movie horror concoction it might have become to a witty smart blend whose characters despite the fantasy framework are very believable. Mills and Crane are about as different as two people can be: shes black hes white; shes Internet-age hes pre-electricity. Ms. Beharie and Mr. Mison work these contrasts with a subtle humor that helps offset the gruesome goings-on. The only worry here is whether the introduction of Abbies sister (Lyndie Greenwood) partway into the season will disturb their droll chemistry.          WORKING BUT WOBBLY  Although NBC is still the butt of a lot of jokes it may have the falls most addictive new series in  The Blacklist.  James Spader is Red Reddington a creepy criminal who decides he wants to help the F.B.I. and C.I.A. catch even creepier criminals but only if he can work with Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone) a young F.B.I. profiler.         Mr. Spader is in something of a straitjacket forced to be annoyingly coy and emotionless. And Ms. Boones character is an increasingly improbable combination of dumb and smart taking an inordinate amount of time to ask the question viewers were asking halfway through the pilot: Might Red be her long-lost father? So far though the actors have made this intriguing enough that the show has been worth keeping up with Ms. Boone managing to be alternately vulnerable and annoyed while Mr. Spader does his cryptic thing. The writers though have some work to do to keep the premise plausible.          WASNT WORKING BUT IS BEGINNING TO  The new fall show with the most attention-getting pair of names atop the bill might well have been the CBS comedy  The Crazy Ones.  It stars Robin Williams a comedy god to many as an aging adman and Sarah Michelle Gellar of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame as his daughter and co-worker.         The pilot didnt bode well for this series. Mr. Williams was doing his Robin Williams shtick while Ms. Gellar and everyone else around him was acting. It was clumsy and worse laugh free.         But as the weeks went along a funny thing started to happen in several senses. Ms. Gellar began to learn how to react to Mr. Williamss excesses  she can be deadly with the deadpan expression  and more important began to assert her own comedy credentials. Mr. Williams is still doing his Robin Williams imitation but Ms. Gellar has become the most amusing actor on the show. Among other things that has helped sell the notion that her character is indeed the daughter of Mr. Williamss unhinged one.          NOT WORKING PART 1  In  Back in the Game  on ABC James Caan is a crusty former minor league baseball player who ends up coaching a team of kiddie misfits that includes his grandson. The pairing here isnt so much Mr. Caan and that child who is played by Griffin Gluck. Its Mr. Caan and the entire team which includes a flamboyantly gay boy a pudgy lad and other unathletic types.         Mr. Caan adopts the growly reluctant coach character familiar from numerous movies with this same structure and the boys deliver their klutzy cutesy moments. But none of it is particularly convincing. Plotlines not related to the team are sometimes amusing but on the ball field the show is content to just regurgitate a creaky formula; none of the actors young or old have found a way to make it new.          NOT WORKING PARTS 2 AND 3  The Fox sitcom  Dads  might be the most awful new comedy that has survived into November. (Inexplicably it has even  been extended .) Its about two friends in their 30s (Seth Green and Giovanni Ribisi) whose fathers move back in with them. This might sound like an ensemble comedy but its more like two two-handers in the same show: a pair of sons and their dads.         Mr. Ribisis father is played by Martin Mull but there must have been a mix-up at the hospital because theres no way that Mr. Mulls character who is a moron could have begat Mr. Ribisis. Sure not all children are younger versions of their parents but these two seem like strangers.         Mr. Green and Peter Riegert who plays his father are even less comfortable together. Both have respectable television credentials but they are wasted by this witless show forced to swap distasteful one-liners without zest or conviction. There may be real father-and-son pairs who interact like this but you wouldnt want them in your living room.                Also in T Magazine »

The historic hotel hosts more than fusion cuisine. Alexander Smalls the executive chef and owner with Richard Parsons the former chief executive of Time Warner also reopened the  landmark jazz club Mintons  next door. The Cecils menu is playfully didactic: An edible conversation about the food of the African diaspora Mr. Smalls said on Wednesday. Since  the Cecil  opened two months ago patrons have been buzzing about the Afro-Asian-American food and scene. There was the actress Tamara Tunie who plays a medical examiner on Law & Order: SVU. In Mr. Smallss home kitchen she was the guinea pig for the cinnamon-scented fried guinea hen. There were parents enjoying a rare night without their wailing baby downtown designers Korean-American friends and artists starving no more.          IN THE SEATS  Three generations of the art world gathered around their mentor  Charles Gaines  69 a conceptual artist and professor at the California Institute of the Arts in residence at Hunter College. Kira Lynn Harris 50 and Edgar Arceneaux 41 former students who came from installing  their show at the Studio Museum in Harlem  with Mr. Arceneauxs assistant Andreas Blazevich 22 and the museums assistant curator Naima J. Keith 32.          ON THE PLATES  For appetizers the table shared the Afro-Asia-American oxtail dumplings ($12) and a bountiful bowl of macaroni and cheese ($20) a luscious baked ziti with peppery ham ($20). Its nuts Ms. Harris said. Mr. Blazevich ordered the grilled Wagyu rib burger with GruyÃ¨re ($16). Ms. Harris had the citrus jerk wild bass ($25). Mr. Arceneaux the grilled petite beef tenderloin (a robust 8 ounces) with okra fries ($23). Mr. Gaines and Ms. Keith had the hen ($27). They balanced the richness with glasses of Haut Courey Bordeaux ($12). Dessert was liquid: Scotch ($12) cognac ($15) and coffee ($3).          WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT  Art and off-color topics. Mr. Gaines joked how Ms. Harris who lives in Harlem once had a male model stalker. Mr. Blazevich the youngest of the artists listened to Mr. Gaines wide-eyed. Hanging out with him is like a high in and of itself he said. They also discussed Mr. Gainess best advice. Mr. Arceneaux recalled: Theres an arbitrary relationship between the quality of your work and the success that you have in the art market. And the two things are not related. Not necessarily related Ms. Harris corrected. He told you too? Mr. Arceneaux said. That was a special moment! Mr. Gaines added Ive been teaching for 40 years and seeing those two become successful he said makes me feel that teaching is worth it.

She is often joined at the game by her two grown daughters Carolyn Tisch Blodgett and Emily Tisch Sussman and her son-in-law William Wilson Blodgett as well as by her mother Joan H. Tisch. The rest of Ms. Tischs week is devoted to supporting the causes she cares about through her  Illumination Fund  founded in 2007 which aims to increase access and opportunity for New Yorkers in areas like the arts and nutrition.          COFFEE AND WEDDINGS  I wake up about 7:15 and of course check Bill Cunningham to see who was the Tisch for the day. For my coffee I have some fancy machine that my daughters gave me. The day generally starts with my reading the weddings section and the girls and I have a flurry of emails  Oh did you see so-and-so got married ...?          DOG WALK WITH BLING   Then I take the dog out Lucy. And if its a Sunday in the fall she usually wears her Giants T-shirt with New York bling.          SPIN CLASS  I typically go with my daughters and maybe my son-in-law if hes not training for a marathon. We each have our handles  mine is LMT Giants Carolyns is CTB Giants Emilys is ETS Giants. There is a board and it says your numbers how youre doing. Im a little competitive so I always put my name on it. Not everybody does.          GAME TIME  The thing about the Giants box is my father bought half of the New York Giants 22 years ago and he loved it and he had political people and heads of educational institutions and friends  it was like the sports version of the Regency power breakfast the people that he liked to be around. Since  my father passed away  [in 2005] I share the box with my mother and brothers and try to have the same mix of people. Business has been done there. I might have John Rhea chairman of the  New York City Housing Authority  with Andy Ackerman executive director of the  Childrens Museum . They have done a deal opening some ancillary shelters programming.          NO OPPOSING HATS  People who come have to love football and love the New York Giants or at least like football and love the Giants. No hats from other teams are allowed in the owners box. At the beginning of the game the girls and I and my son-in-law will go down to the field and watch the warm-up a little bit. Im always dying to jump in. I will greet the visiting owner.          PASS THE POPCORN  We eat at the game. I try not to eat the things I really want to eat. I havent had a hot dog in two years. My daughters are vegetarians. I will have a salad with salmon or theres sushi. Theres a pasta chef. I do have an enormous amount of popcorn. Im feeling sorry for myself for not eating the hot dogs and then the cookies come out at halftime. You know how women eat cookies; the smaller pieces you break it into the fewer calories it has.          AMONG THE MATRIARCHS  I need to pay pretty close attention because I dont know the game that well. Im not in a very good mood when we lose but I run a foundation and this is a game. I kind of keep it in perspective. I definitely see my kids more than I would were it not for the Giants. The fact is the real owners of the team are my mother and  Ann Mara . Ann Mara goes to every game. Its her box. We share it.          DINNER OUT OR IN   By the time I get home Im exhausted. For dinner I tend to stay in the neighborhood  Chat Noir  or  Match 65 . Or Ill go with my daughter and son-in-law on the Upper West Side  the Smith  or  Boulud Sud . Or I order in from  Seamless  and watch another game or  Homeland.    GOODNIGHT LUCY   At about 10 Lucy has to go back out. Shell wear her Giants shirt if we win.

The home at 130 East 64th Street stands out like a snowflake on its tree-lined block between Park and Lexington Avenues; the annual taxes are $52211.20.         The 15-foot-wide residence was designed along conventional lines by James E. Ware in 1878 but was boldly reimagined in white inside and out by Mr. Stone. Drawing inspiration from Frank Lloyd Wright he infused his midcareer designs with whimsical and decorative elements attuned to nature. Harnessing light  not just with the window wall facing the street but with an oversize geometric skylight above the top-floor landing that repeats the greenhouse style of the covered patio on the parlor level  was a major theme of his virtuosic renovation.         He ripped out the interior walls to create a flowing front-to-back parlor-level great room with 11-foot ceilings extending the side walls and pushing the front facade forward for a greater sense of space and openness. There was and is no structure quite like it in the city: the external alterations Mr. Stone dreamed up in 1956 would not be permitted today.         The four-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath house received landmark designation in 1981 three years after Mr. Stones death. The home has since changed hands twice.         In 2006 Andrew Cogan and Lori Finkel who had bought the townhouse two years before donated an easement to the  Trust for Architectural Easements  to guarantee that the rear and front facades could never be altered. The pattern of the concrete grille is alluded to throughout the house most notably in the kitchen backsplash tile the wallpaper and the library ceiling. The grille reappears on the east wall of the terrace which connects to the yard by an exterior stairway of glass and stone. When Mr. Cogan and Ms. Finkel bought the house they commissioned the architect  Benjamin Hicks Stone  Mr. Stones youngest son to restore it and update the kitchen bathrooms and mechanical systems.         The house is entered at street level and Mr. Stone retained the interior staircase with its white spindles and mahogany railing. The ground level has a guest bedroom suite with garden access. The parlor floor is an open living/dining/entertainment space; a 13-by-25-foot living room at the back has a marble fireplace original mahogany molding around the rear bay windows and a glass door to the terrace. The third floor which retains two original fireplaces comprises the master suite and library and on the top floor there are two bedrooms each with its own bath.         Mr. Cogan the chief executive of Knoll a furniture and textiles company said he and Ms. Finkel had been searching on the Upper East Side for a cool modern house not necessarily a landmark when they happened upon the townhouse. We fell in love with it at first sight even though it was a bit of a wreck he said. The restoration took a year. But we didnt even refinish the white marble tile floor on the parlor level. We liked it the way it was. The house is a special piece of New York of a certain modernist moment.         The family which numbers three children and a very large dog plans to relocate downtown. Weve done vertical living and its been fabulous Mr. Cogan said and now we want the kids to experience a different neighborhood. But I feel better about the house knowing that we will have left it in better shape than we found it.         Edward Durell Stones early designs include the grand ballroom and main lobby of the Waldorf-Astoria a project he was assigned while working for Schultze & Weaver and the Museum of Modern Art which he designed in 1937 with Philip Goodwin. He may be best remembered for a more imposing local landmark the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue the white marble behemoth designed with Emery Roth & Sons. But the townhouse is among the most personal displays of his vision.         The listing broker Roger Erickson of Sothebys International Realty predicted that the next owner of the Edward Durell Stone House  its significance is commemorated on a red plaque by the front door  will be an aficionado of the midcentury modern aesthetic. There is a premium to be paid by art collectors who are looking to live in a work of art he said. And I would guess that whoever buys this house will be buying it for that reason sensitivity to its history its architecture and the man who designed it.                Also in Video »       
335,100000002538746,0,Article,News,Real Estate,realestate,,Up-to-Date Homes in Antique Packaging,ALISON GREGOR,1098,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/realestate/up-to-date-homes-in-antique-packaging.html,9,Renovating or converting a historic building can be difficult and costly but the citys supercharged condominium market is enabling some developers to go far beyond merely sprucing up interiors.         Two developers have bought rows of old buildings  one on the Upper East Side the other on the Upper West  and while restoring their historic facades will reconfigure and rebuild their interiors from the ground up creating a brand-new series of multimillion-dollar condos.         In both developments which went before the Landmarks Preservation Commission and received significant community comment developers had to modify and scale back parts of their initial plans particularly with respect to the rooftop additions.         Daniel E. Straus the chief executive of CareOne a company that operates nursing and assisted-living facilities said the decision to reinvent the interiors of a row of brownstones on Madison Avenue  part of a project called 33 East 74thStreet  was less about market conditions and more about being able to deliver the type of high-end real estate product he envisioned.         This project was conceived in 2010 when market conditions were less than robust Mr. Straus said. Its possible that the difficulty of a project like this would dissuade other developers but thats what excited me  the uniqueness of the property.         The Whitney Museum was the seller of the six brownstones at 933-943 Madison Avenue built in 1876 in the Italianate and Greek Revival styles along with two buildings right around the corner: the brownstone at 31 East 74th Street and the 33-foot-wide Grosvenor Atterbury mansion at 33 East 74th built in 1901. Mr. Straus paid about $95 million in the transaction which took place in 2010. The museum had used two of the buildings for office space; some had had retail space on their ground floors.         All are in the  Upper East Side Historic District  so Mr. Straus working with the architects and preservation specialists  Beyer Blinder Belle  sought and received  Landmarks Preservation Commission  approval last summer to create 10 condo units. This will entail creating a stepped-back three-story rooftop addition over all the buildings and a connecting structure between buildings on Madison and East 74th as well as rebuilding the brownstone closest to the Whitney Museum 943 Madison a building deemed of no value to the historic district.         Demolishing all the brownstone interiors enabled Mr. Straus to create the layouts that he believes will best appeal to his target buyers. The three- to five-bedroom condo units will have 10-foot ceilings; the smallest will have 3850 square feet of space the largest more than 10000. Each will also feature an entrance gallery over 20 feet long while each bedroom will have an en-suite bath and an entry vestibule.          Champalimaud  the interior design company on the project is employing custom millwork and materials like polished Calacatta and honed Bardiglio marble and ziricote wood.         The four-story Atterbury mansion which has a structural system separate from the brownstones is being gutted but will retain its floors its giant second-floor arched windows and its 13-foot ceiling heights. There will be two elevators for condo owners but the mansion and the three-story penthouse planned atop its roof will each have private elevators.         Prices will range from $14 million to more than $30 million said Katherine Gauthier an agent with Douglas Elliman Real Estate which is bringing 33 East 74th Street to market in mid-November. The project should be completed by early 2015 Mr. Straus said.         With little competing new construction in the area the project is seen as attracting Upper East Siders or even Upper West Siders seeking something traditional-looking but not in need of renovation said Karen Mansour a Douglas Elliman executive vice president. Or because of the location and its proximity to shopping on Madison Avenue and Museum Mile she added it could be a pied-Ã -terre for an international buyer as well. And it could also appeal to families who are sending their children to school on the Upper East Side.         On the West Side at 182 West 82nd Street Miki Naftali the chief executive of the Naftali Group is already marketing a similar if less pricey project. Mr. Naftali bought four Romanesque Revival apartment buildings five stories high and built in the 1900s for about $17 million in 2012. He has demolished the interiors of the buildings  again with the assent of Landmarks Preservation as they belong to the Upper West Side/Central Park West Historic District  and is rebuilding them as one structure with 11 condo units called  182 West 82nd Street .         Neither Mr. Straus nor Mr. Naftali would reveal the cost of their projects though Mr. Straus acknowledged that 33 East 74th Street had cost more than anticipated. Mr. Naftali a veteran  New York City  developer with an engineering background says that working with old buildings can often involve unforeseen costs particularly when rebuilding their interiors from the ground up while bracing their facades.         These types of projects are so unique so its very hard to estimate the entire cost said Mr. Naftali who is working with the architecture firm  ODA . Theyre challenging in a way that we like and frankly were not the only one that can do it but it requires a lot of expertise to deal with these projects  dealing with Landmarks and everything.         While the team at 33 East 74th Street cut down the number of bedrooms in favor of features like column-free grand rooms galleries and entry vestibules the team at 182 West 82nd Street worked to design efficient units with lots of flexibility with bedrooms convertible to libraries and dens to bedrooms said Alexa Lambert an agent with Stribling & Associates which is marketing the project.         Ranging in size from 1900 to 5200 square feet and offering three to five bedrooms the units include two 37-foot-wide townhouses each with three levels and a rear garden and two penthouses in a two-story addition atop the entirety of the complex. Ceiling heights are 9.5 feet though the townhouses have some reaching 10.5 feet Ms. Lambert said.         The units have large master bathrooms and kitchens are open-plan; both have fixtures by the high-end German company Dornbracht along with expensive slab marble accents. The penthouses and townhouses have working fireplaces. Prices for units now being marketed range from about $4.5 million to $6.6 million and the project will be completed in the summer of 2014 according to Mr. Naftali.         At the end of the day he said were creating a mix between the Old World and the New World because everything is completely new inside but you still get the Old World charm.         This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 17 2013 Because of an editing error an article last Sunday about a new development at 33 East 74th Street misstated the price range for units. They will be listed from $14 million to more than $30 million not up to $30 million.        Also in Video »       
336,100000002533559,0,Article,News,Magazine,magazine,,Where Have All the Sopranos Gone?,ELIZABETH WEIL,3988,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/magazine/where-have-all-the-sopranos-gone.html,24,The ever-earlier onset of puberty is reshaping the legendary Leipzig boys choir.  A fter school and lunch but before afternoon rehearsals the sopranos and altos of the St. Thomas Boys Choir in Leipzig Germany tried to master their skateboards while the tenors and basses kissed their girlfriends and texted. Thoralf Schulze the Latin teacher and the choirs dean walked among them describing each with the analytical intimacy of a coach calling out the age at which each choristers voice broke and how long he sat benched before he could sing with the choir again.         Twelve! Six months only!         Twelve! One year!         Thirteen! One year!         Thirteen! Six months!         The boys live at St. Thomas and attend a public school nearby. Schulze entered the boys dorm called the alumnat and walked up the stairs extending a hand to a handsome young bass. Adrian Schulze said smiling with relief. He was 15.         Puberty is always momentous awkward and bittersweet but perhaps nowhere more so than here. The St. Thomas Boys Choir is 801 years old. Johann Sebastian Bach served as its Thomaskantor or choirmaster from 1723 to 1750 during which time he complained about the boys lack of musical talent and paid a co-worker to take over the Latin class that he was also supposed to teach. Since then the choir has become something of a Bach historical re-enactment program  a homage to its greatest musical director; not quite Colonial Williamsburg but inching in that direction.         Each weekday the choir rehearses under the direction of Georg Christoph Biller a stern man with wild hair. Each Friday when they are not traveling in Germany or abroad they sing a motet at St. Thomas Church. Then during the weekend as it has for at least 200 years the choir usually performs a composition by Bach. (The choir will be singing at Lincoln Center on Nov. 12.)         But maintaining Bachs legacy has become more difficult. The problem is with the sopranos. At St. Thomas as in all boys choirs the oldest of those singers with unbroken voices are the most prized. Like flowers that are most beautiful just before they die these boys have the most power stamina and technique. There are scholars who say that in Bachs day some boys voices didnt change until as late as 17. Now boys voices are changing earlier a lot earlier. Medical records tracking puberty through history do not exist but Joshua Goldstein chairman of the demography department at the University of California Berkeley has analyzed mortality patterns among boys which can show increased risk-taking and by extension the onset of puberty. His research suggests that the age of puberty for boys has dropped on average 2.5 months a decade since the mid-1700s. That would mean that boys are sopranos for a shorter time. To maintain a well-stocked soprano section St. Thomas needs to start with and train more boys. To house growing numbers of recruits the choir has built a new larger glass-and-steel-frame alumnat.         Schulze poked his head into some of the boys living quarters a warren of twin beds messy desks and pictures of rock bands and beautiful women taped to the wall. For centuries choristers of all ages have lived together in suites the older taking care of the younger in St. Thomass prefect system. But the gap between the knowing and unknowing or bearded and unbearded boys as various music scholars have put it is becoming wider. Boys enter the choir at the start of fourth grade age 9. Some in the alumnat still miss their mothers; a few call home at night and ask to sleep there. But nine years later when the Thomaners graduate from high school and the choir many no longer fit the angelic chorister model. One corner of the suite could have been in a frat house: free weights beer bottles deodorant soccer balls.         Schulze didnt seem concerned about the collegiate-style mess. One of his goals is fostering what he calls normal boys who know how to relax and enjoy themselves outside rehearsal. What he cares about as does everyone at St. Thomas is the singing. Leaving the suite on the way to his office Schulze passed the laundry room its clothes racks filled with the Thomaners performance outfits: blue jackets and pants for the older boys the tenors and basses; sailor uniforms for the sopranos and altos. The younger Thomaners costumes were better than robes and ruffles the fate of boys in other choirs. But who wants to wear a big infantilizing sailor collar into his teens? I asked Schulze at what age in his estimation voice change would ideally occur  when he would like to see the boys switch from sailor suit to jacket and pants. Fifteen would be not so nice for the boy he said but for the choir sublime. He comes to live at the alumnat at 9 years. Hes at the level of the choir at 10. If he goes at 12 for voice break we have only two years together to get the music made.         In a brick building near the alumnat called the Villa Biller sat behind a grand piano dressed in a black turtleneck and black pants. Biller who is 58 is the 16th Thomaskantor since Bach. Bach was almost not a Thomaskantor at all; he was offered the job only after two other men turned it down.         About 10 minutes into the soprano rehearsal a young singer in a Ron Jon T-shirt opened the heavy door and took his place among the 10 other sopranos. Biller raised a formidable eyebrow.         Why have you not joined us earlier? Biller asked in German. (A bass with a British mother translated for me.)         I was playing soccer the boy said.         Ashamed but not ashamed enough the soprano took a seat under an ancient chandelier. Behind him sat a boy a head taller than he a Harry Potter look-alike named Lukas  thin with round glasses excellent posture and sweeping hair. Biller nodded at Lukas. Earlier he had praised the older boy saying You are almost ready to lead the section now. But how long could Lukas maintain that role? Puberty is typically a three-year or four-year process with a growth spurt that starts before voice change. Already Lukass pants looked a little too short.         Biller conducting with facial expressions while his hands were tied up playing piano led the sopranos through O Domine Jesu Christe a motet written by Johann Hermann Schein who was a Thomaskantor a century before Bach. The boys sounded a little weak and fuzzy but still beautiful precisely the sound that people have loved for at least 500 years. Of course achieving that sound has been tricky for as long as it has been treasured. Griping in 1547 the Swiss music theorist Heinrich Glarean wrote Boys especially could sing the highest voice if they were not frequently unacquainted with the song. In 1668 BÃ©nigne de Bacilly a French vocal instructor and composer voiced what has been a persistent complaint: As soon as a teacher has taken great care and pains to train a boys voice it disappears. At one point Bach presided over 55 choristers about a quarter of whom were sopranos and he listed 17 of them as unproficient. (There are 106 today including only 11 sopranos.) But the challenges were part of the job and Biller had no time to waste. It was his second of only five rehearsals with this section that week. In three days well-prepared or not they would sing in St. Thomas Church on risers in front of Bachs grave.         Toward the end of the session Biller turned to Bachs Mass in B Minor and began to offer a lesson. Along with teaching music Biller was charged with maintaining a cultural legacy. What is Bachs idea? Biller asked the boys as they opened their worn scores.         Nobody answered. Billers brows pinched. He soon excused the sopranos and the tenors and basses entered their bodies filling the room. Their diction sounded crisp their voices strong. Finally singers old enough to handle the music. Billers face relaxed.          Now we have  the possibility of a young boy sounding like Joe Cocker Michael Fuchs an ear nose and throat specialist and the voice doctor of the choir told me. We can have an early adult voice without an adult personality. He sounds like his father when hes still a boy.         Fuchss own voice broke in 1983 when he was a Thomaner age 13. He liked the voice doctor of the choir then and decided to follow his career path. Now trim goateed in good shoes and fashionable eyeglasses hes among the worlds experts on the timing of voice break. Certainly nobody cares more. We have a problem in the choir Fuchs said when we met in his office at Leipzig University hospital echoing concerns I heard time and again. The balance is shifting. We have more mens voices and fewer boys voices. The obvious solution  starting boys in the choir at 8 instead of 9  does not work. The choir tried and the 8-year-olds couldnt handle life in the alumnat learning all the pieces and attending all the rehearsals. So the plan now is to squeeze every day out of the soprano voices. We try to let the boys sing as long as possible without risking overloading the boys and damaging the voice Fuchs said. Many of the Thomaners hold Fuchs in mystical esteem claiming he can predict to the day when their voices will break.         Of course not the day Fuchs demurred but maybe two three weeks.         In the years before the boys hit puberty Fuchs saw them every three months to record growth hormone levels and voice. He played for me recordings of one boy speaking and singing the same passage of a choral piece every year from age 11 to 14. Even to my untrained ear the differences over time sounded stark the boys voice becoming richer and fuller until the day it shattered. Mining data from the recordings Fuchs constructs scatter plots showing changes over time in jitter (variation in pitch) shimmer (variation in loudness) noise component (breathiness) and range. All this data provides context so that he can distinguish what is causing flaws in a boys voice. Is it a cold? A problem of singing technique? Voice break can sound like laryngitis.         Martin Ashley founder of Boys Keep Singing a British group dedicated to keeping boys in choirs is the author of the monograph How High Should Boys Sing? In it he quotes a vocal expert who describes the boy-chorister sound as clear cold piercing and transparent . . . disembodied ethereal and ghostly . . . enchanted naÃ¯ve and guileless. A typical boys voice falls from about 500 Hz as a baby to 300 Hz as a toddler to 200 Hz before puberty and its the last sound that choir directors and listeners crave. In 1927 Hear My Prayer by the 15-year-old British soprano Ernest Lough became HMVs first classical record to sell a million copies. In 1955 Keith Richards then 11 performed in Westminster Abbey with two other boy sopranos for the queen.         To see how a boy is maturing physically Fuchs threads a tiny camera through the nose and into the larynx so he can watch and record the vocal anatomy while the boy sings. (When Fuchs was a Thomaner the doctor used what amounted to a dental mirror on a long narrow stick to see into their throats; by comparison Fuchs said his test wasnt bad once the boys learned to control their gag reflex.) The videos are intimate and alarming  the vibrating glottis the gaping trachea: Jonahs view from inside the whale. That red is the leading edge of cells growing Fuchs said pointing to a vocal fold on his computer screen. Can you hear how its not possible to bring the vocal cords into good vibration? he added during a particularly scratchy patch. If this were from overstress and not voice break you would see it on the surface. Like if you went to the forest to cut wood. Youd have nodules on your hands and edema. Stress on the vocal cords looks the same.         While their voices are changing Thomaners dont rehearse or perform but they still have bi-weekly singing lessons during which they work on diction and breath control. Singing too much while your voice is changing can lead to bad habits and injuries similar to an athlete playing hurt. Late Wednesday afternoon a tall awkward 13-year-old named Alexander spent half an hour with a private instructor meticulously enunciating  la-pla-lu ma-la-plu la-pla-lo ma-la-plo  and making sounds like deflating balloons and air compressing into tires. His teacher was a lovely young concert singer in an argyle sweater and white boots. She massaged the stress out of Alexanders jaw and neck while he did his best to stare at the wall. Va vey vop voop veep vip. Toward the end of the session Alexander sang scales ranging two octaves his teacher writing down which notes he lost at the top dropped in the middle and gained at the bottom.         This was nobodys fantasy of being a Thomaner but you cant stop the body from maturing  even though the thought has occurred at St. Thomas. Of course Cantor Biller asks me at times Do you have some idea to delay onset?  Fuchs said. Puberty-stalling drugs do exist. They are prescribed by endocrinologists for children with extremely early sexual development. But preserving sopranos voices through chemistry? Not even the most passionate choir fans suggest using pharmacology to replace the bygone castrati. Thats absolutely forbidden from the medical point of view Fuchs said.         Biller took O Domine from the top. After a minute he folded his hands and stopped the singing. The sopranos were flat.         Many at St. Thomas hope the sopranos will have an easier time if they receive more early training. In 2008 an organization affiliated with the choir opened a kindergarten where children learn to read and write music at the same time they learn to read and write words. Each morning I was there 5-year-olds with slippers on the wrong feet sang HÃ¤nschen Klein and played rhythm games listening for light or ominous sounds as their teacher played piano. On the wall outside the kindergartens administrative office hung violin-shaped hooks and paint-by-number portraits of Bach. We are able to realize very soon if a boy will be able to be a Thomaner Heike HÃ¼bler the kindergarten administrator at the time told me. Maybe 60 to 70 percent learn an instrument too piano or violin outside of school.         In addition Lana Toschev the primary scout for the choir scours Leipzigs other kindergartens searching for boys who can sing at least an octave above middle C. Those boys can join St. Thomass music program in partnership with a public elementary school where she trains the boys four days a week. That Thursday she sat at a baby grand piano before a semicircle of 7-year-olds including her own son. Few of their feet reached the floor. Most of their just-in adult front teeth looked too big.         One by one the boys walked over to the piano bench. Toschev plinked a note; the boy as directed sang that pitch and then a third above.         Every day is hard work she told me. Still they all wanted to be Thomaners. Not as much as they wanted to be professional soccer players or cyclists or pilots but being a chorister ranked high among their dreams. Toschevs pupils are not guaranteed a spot in the choir; they compete in auditions with boys throughout Germany. Maybe 70 percent will be able to be Thomaners Toschev said as she erased notes from the music staff on the chalkboard. They are very valuable these boys. Without them the Thomaner choir cannot exist. But they have to be intelligent they have to love music they have to have rhythmic feeling.         Back in the atrium Biller began the next pass through the motet. This time the sopranos overcorrected; they sounded sharp and screechy. The third time Biller asked them to stand and sing. Generally he works the sopranos longer and harder than any other section. While the young boys sang a few older boys furtively pulled out smartphones but most sat poised and paid attention. At last on the fourth pass the sound was better the high notes clear and bright.         After rehearsal on the way to dinner I asked one of the tenors how he felt when his voice changed. Of course you want to be a man he replied. But you are only a boy once and here when your voice breaks you are a bit . . . angry.         There have been studies that try to answer this question; they are sort of like studies that try to detect whether people can distinguish between cheap and expensive wine. Judging blind few can tell the two apart. Bach used boy sopranos at St. Thomas because it was an all-male institution. But he is also known to have on occasion employed female sopranos boy sopranos and adult males singing falsetto. I fear I cant see any evidence that Bach cared particularly about boys at all Joshua Rifkin a conductor and professor of music at Boston University told me. All of this is our modern projection back.         In addition Rifkin said given his youth and inexperience the boy singing today is further away from the boy of Bachs day than the woman singing now is from the woman of Bachs day. Records of Bachs 1729 audition show a number of 13- and 14-year-olds  entering  choir. Joseph Haydn still had such a good soprano voice well into his teens that his choirmaster encouraged him to have surgery to make him a castrato. (Haydns father objected however and he was spared.) Its a terrible parallel to draw but we dont have that instrument Rifkin continued. Just like we dont have castrati.         But in fact in many ways the choir is more invested in its all-male tradition than ever. Before the Berlin Wall fell Leipzig and St. Thomas belonged to East Germany and the state ran the choir. In the former time Stefan Altner the general manager of the choir told me it was all the central agency from Berlin: You have to make a tour in Japan. We organize it for you!  Now he said We are responsible for bringing the choir to the worldwide market. The modest admission price for the Thomaners Leipzig recitals and the small fee the parents pay do not cover the choirs costs. The city of Leipzig along with the Thomanerchor foundation and a parents association provide significant financing. Yet the pressure to raise money remains. We make films we do radio we talk to journalists and to media for the choirs future Altner said. Always when you go on stage you have to be so good that each person in the audience can compare the sound with the CD and compare it with other choirs on the market. Always you have to be so good as to be the best.         Friday afternoon the Thomaners in their skinny jeans and sneakers stood on the balcony of St. Thomas Church and rehearsed the motet one final time. Tourists below paused and snapped pictures as Biller worked the sopranos again and again. Some of the music sounded so sad so burdened so aware of death it was hard to imagine how the boys could connect with it. Two very old men shuffled in and sat on the wooden pews. Just across the brick plaza stood the Bach Archive which includes a repository for 18th-century instruments still used for occasional performances. In a strictly rational sense the boy sopranos might belong there as well. But as Andrew Parrott the British conductor famed among aficionados for his historically informed performances of Bach said: We may have gotten emotionally attached to the presence of the boy in a nonmusical way. Rifkin added: Theres something utterly magical and profoundly heart-wrenching about it. Maybe particularly in music where people have to reach into and give you something so deep from within themselves.         After the final rehearsal the boys walked back through town. At 4:15 p.m. a bell rang in the alumnat signaling that it was time for the sopranos and altos to line up in front of Simon Jacobs an 18-year-old bass. Jacobs was the Thomaners domesticus and every Friday evening he sat on an ornate wooden chair and inspected the young boys to make sure they looked concert ready  shoes shiny sailor jackets straight hands clean. In his cluttered suite fabric brush in one hand shoe polish in the other Jacobs spun around a 10-year-old smoothing the back of his jacket and picking some loose threads. According to Thomaner tradition tenors and basses are spared this ritual. The choir assumes a singer with a broken voice can dress himself. Lukas among the choirs most talented sopranos dashed into his room five minutes late changed quickly into his sailor suit and headed back out again without stopping for inspection. Just before the concert I asked him why he skipped the domesticus ritual. Today is my birthday! Lukas said. I turned 13. Presumably he felt too old.         The church bells rang at 6 p.m. and the Thomaners walked two by two from the back of the church to the front. Passing through the crowd the boys seemed marvelous and otherworldly. So much about the concert was humble: the risers Billers conductors stand the audience in sensible shoes and jeans. But the singing was magnificent soaring and poignant and hard won. When the choir finished Biller bowed very slightly and the boys walked back through the sanctuary again spilling out onto the church stairs and into the night. The older Thomaners clutched their girlfriends the younger ones their mothers. Fuchs suspected that Lukass soprano would last no more than a year longer two at most. Then his ethereal voice would slip away joining all those that rose and fell before his in St. Thomas Church.

We were driving on Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn with my grandson. We told him there used to be a bridle path next to the roadway. He asked when the bridle path was eliminated and the reason for its removal.    A.  In the 1970s during a restoration project for Ocean Parkway the bridle path was eliminated and paved over Ronald Schweiger Brooklyns borough historian said in an email. Today there are benches and a pedestrian path in its place. In 1975 Ocean Parkway was designated as a New York City Scenic Landmark. It is also on the National Register of Historic Places.         In 1894 the  first bike path  in the United States was created on the west side of Ocean Parkway. Today the western side has a 5.9-mile bike path from Prospect Park ending a block from the Coney Island boardwalk. The bridle path was on the east side. There was a horse stable near the south entrance to Prospect Park. You could rent a horse and ride from the park all the way to Coney Island Mr. Schweiger said.         A stable on Kermit Place a small street near Prospect Park is still in use today Mr. Schweiger said and horseback riding is still allowed in the park. There was once another stable on the northwest corner of Avenue S and Coney Island Avenue said Mr. Schweiger who grew up one block from the bridle path on Avenue S.         Ocean Parkway used to hold horse-and-carriage races and sleigh races in winter he added. There were two horse-racing tracks near Ocean Parkway in Gravesend and Brighton Beach. Horse racing ended about 1910 when the state banned betting at the tracks.          Q. As winter nears and the acorns begin to drop I wonder: Is it legal to feed the squirrels in our parks? Just a little?    A.  Toss them a smile and thats it.         While feeding squirrels is not prohibited (except in certain designated areas marked with posted signs) the feeding of any wild animals including birds and squirrels is discouraged Philip Abramson a spokesman for the citys Department of Parks and Recreation said in an email pointing out that food left out can attract other rodents.         Feeding squirrels can also make them dependent on people discourage them from foraging for food on their own and alter their nutrition Mr. Abramson added. Squirrels can become tame or they may become defensive and even bite people when they try to feed them. No matter which way you look at it feeding wild animals is risky for both the humans and the animals involved.         Email: fyi@nytimes.com        Also in T Magazine »       
338,100000002540738,0,Article,News,Real Estate,realestate,,Townhouse Turnaround,CONSTANCE ROSENBLUM,2367,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/realestate/townhouse-turnaround.html,1,The New York townhouse has been through a lot since it began appearing in profusion in the 19th century.         These stately buildings started life as single-family houses sheltering comfortable middle- and upper-class families and their servants. By the Great Depression most had been chopped into single-room apartments the unlucky among them getting the greatest wear as rooming houses for the down and out.         In the 60s plucky young New Yorkers with more enthusiasm than cash began buying these down-at-the-heels beauties and spiffing them up for their families usually retaining tenants who provided rental income and in many cases were impossible to dislodge.         In the past few years the historic townhouse has started to come full circle. Thanks to the growing appetite for larger and more luxurious private urban dwellings among people happy to pay upward of $10 million many townhouses have been returned to the elegant single-family homes they once were.         To the casual passer-by the changes may be invisible. On the East and West Sides of Manhattan in Greenwich Village and in large swaths of what is commonly called Brooklyns brownstone belt brick brownstone and limestone facades encrusted with corbels and lintels continue to mirror a distant era.         But these ornate fronts conceal profound shifts in occupancy demographics and financial structure. Townhouses represent only a small fraction of the citys housing stock but because they define certain beloved neighborhoods the implications of their transformation are great  though whether the shift represents boon or blight depends on who is being asked.         These houses have always been commodities  they were built after all by real estate developers said  Patrick Ciccone  a preservationist who is preparing a revised edition of Bricks and Brownstone Charles Lockwoods landmark 1972 study of the New York townhouse. So returning a townhouse to single-family occupancy might be the most historically appropriate thing to do given its original use.         But Mr. Ciccone added in the process of such conversions what may be sacrificed is the life and activity on the street produced by variety in the size density and affordability of residences. So whats good for one house he said can also be bad urbanism for the city as a whole.         This time around a different breed of New Yorker is working the magic on these buildings. As tenants move or die off many owners are reclaiming entire buildings. Perhaps most important developers are doing the same a process that often entails a gut renovation and high-end amenities (elevators and wine cellars de rigueur).         Notwithstanding the rear glass walls increasingly common in retrofitted townhouses the better to brighten dark interiors many 21st-century buyers harbor an unexpected taste for Edith Wharton-style dÃ©cor. They wax eloquent about coffered ceilings and mahogany wainscoting. Savoring a 19th-century aesthetic they seek meticulously preserved period facades along with lush interior details like carved moldings and wood-burning fireplaces even if reinterpreted in contemporary materials.         And the numbers of these buyers is growing. According to Dexter Guerrieri the president of Vandenberg the Townhouse Experts 15 of the 48 townhouses sold last year on the Upper West Side were multifamily dwellings being returned to single-family homes either by developers or what are called end users. Thats nearly a third of West Side sales Mr. Guerrieri said a high percentage and one thats been increasing in recent years.         He and other townhouse watchers attribute the shift in part to a desire for bigger and more opulent homes that provide a degree of privacy unavailable in condominiums and especially co-ops. These homes also often offer other benefits: Residents can have a garden; they can own a dog without asking anyones permission. Many of these houses are in picturesque neighborhoods with an embracing sense of community.         But money is the driving force Mr. Guerrieri said. Values are rising and developers are seeing the big numbers that these houses sell for.         This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 17 2013 An article last Sunday about the restoration of townhouses in New York to single-family use misstated the asking price for a townhouse at 304 West 90th Street. It is $12.995 million not $14 million. The error was repeated in a picture caption.        Also in Video »

340,100000002534097,0,Article,News,Travel,travel,,National Parks Open Just in Time for Snow,EMILY BRENNAN,385,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/travel/national-parks-open-just-in-time-for-snow.html,4,Good news for travelers to national parks this winter: Although the federal government shutdown from Oct. 1 to 16 forced the National Park Service to close 401 parks and lose $450000 a day in revenue it did little to slow preparations for winter activities like cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.         That the shutdown occurred during the shoulder season eased the pain for national parks like Yellowstone which was already winding down its services from the peak summer season when its employees were furloughed. Yellowstone which lost $191000 in entrance fees and licenses during the closure reopened in time to start grooming roads for activities like guided snowmobile and snow coach tours which begin in December.         Even Yosemite and Rocky Mountain National Parks which both suffered damage from natural disasters this summer have bounced back from the shutdown.         In August Yosemite lost 77000 acres of forest to the Rim Fire which started in the neighboring Stanislaus National Forest and burned about 400 square miles. The damage though was limited to the remote northwestern corner of the park near Hetch Hetchy Reservoir leaving main tourist areas like Yosemite Falls and Glacier Point untouched and a majority of the parks infrastructure intact.         Scott Gediman a spokesman for Yosemite said that while the government shutdown caused the park to lose thousands of dollars in revenue it did little to slow the parks rehabilitation because the scorched area is mostly designated wilderness.         That means he said that as the National Park Service we dont go in and replant trees.         Fire is basically a natural process he added. It actually had some good ecological aspects.         Rocky Mountain National Park which was inundated by floods and landslides that began on Sept. 11 is also fortunate that damage was confined mostly to its designated wilderness area.         Kyle Patterson a spokesman for Rocky Mountain said that the shutdown caused minor delays in park rangers assessment of the damage and that some trails and footbridges particularly around Endovalley still needed to be repaired.         The park however is on schedule for its winter season of skiing and snowshoeing. And because Route 36 which suffered severe damage from flooding opened on Nov. 4 travelers will have easier access to the park.

341,100000002534183,0,Article,News,Travel,travel,,"In France, Honoring the Fallen in the War to End All Wars",NANCY R. NEWHOUSE,1827,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/travel/in-france-honoring-the-fallen-in-the-war-to-end-all-wars.html,12,I stood on the edge of quiet fields stretching away to woods near the small French town of FÃ¨re-en-Tardenois in the Marne Valley. Before me loomed a monumental and poignant figure: an American soldier in World War I carrying a dead comrade from the battlefield. There is not much else here: a simple inscribed plinth and a bench a sense of past loss and silence.         A French friend had told me about this memorial to the Battle of Croix Rouge Farm and in April when I was in Paris I came to see it myself. My larger goal was to visit at least a small part of the land fought over in both the First and Second Battles of the Marne. In advance of the approaching centenary of World War I (1914-1918) I wanted to sense something of the experience of American soldiers who were key participants in the last year of the war. The story of this single battle and of the memorials creation was my first window into the fierce drama of the war to end all wars and the American role which I knew little about.         On July 26 1918 the 167th (Alabama) Infantry Regiment along with the 168th (Iowa) attacked strongly held German positions in the Battle of Croix Rouge Farm. In fierce fighting the Americans took heavy losses advancing across open fields (unlike the trench warfare typical of much of World War I) toward the well-fortified farmhouse complex and the German machine gun nests in the nearby woods.         In the final push Maj. John W. Carroll the First Battalions commander shouted: Save your fire men! Well give em hell with the bayonet. One soldier recalled it was the only hand-to-hand fighting I saw during the war and Gen. Douglas MacArthur later spoke admiringly of the Alabamians and Iowans citing their gallantry.         They did prevail in this small but intense action near ChÃ¢teau-Thierry only 45 miles east of Paris and the Germans retreated. It was part of the Second Battle of the Marne a major theater for American troops as they poured into  France  250000 a month in the last year of the war.         Today the son of one of those Alabama infantrymen has created a striking memorial on the site. It pays tribute to the 167th (Alabama) Infantry Regiment and the United States 42nd Infantry (Rainbow) Division of which it was part (Rainbow because the division was formed of units from 26 states and the District of Columbia). Dedicated the day after Armistice Day 2011 it was the longtime dream of Nimrod T. Frazer now in his 80s of Montgomery Ala. whose father Sgt. William Johnson Frazer was awarded a Purple Heart after the battle and it came into being in ample time for the anniversary of the Great War.         The centenary is of huge significance in Europe and a rich tapestry of events is planned to honor it. From the battlefields of the Marne and the Somme in France and Ypres in Belgium to Gallipoli Sarajevo and the British Commonwealth countries ceremonies will be held most beginning next August the month the war began. And many museums such as the National World War I Museum at Liberty Memorial in Kansas City Mo. will hold events connected to Armistice Day ( Veterans Day  in the United States) this Nov. 11. Exhibitions will proliferate and the Imperial War Museum in London will open new World War I galleries next summer.         In France part of an ambitious pan-European program is underway right now: La Grande Collecte-Europeana 1914-1918. Through Nov. 16 at 70 collection points around the country individuals can bring in their family or personal documents from the war. Archivists and specialists are available free and some material will be digitized for public online access on  Europeana1914-1918.eu .         World War I battlefield tours in France are already popular many run by British companies to the Somme where so many British troops fought and tours will proliferate during the centenary. While solemn ceremonies will be held at key sites like Verdun where French losses in 1916 exceeded 200000 men groups of World War I buffs worldwide are also planning events. For instance in Dayton Ohio the League of WW1 Aviation Historians in conjunction with the National Museum of the United States Air Force will stage flyovers of vintage fighter planes next September.         Anyone connected through a family member or simply with an interest in this war which destroyed much of a generation of men in Europe and drastically reconfigured its culture and moral outlook will feel the pull of these four extraordinary years.         I began my April visit at ChÃ¢teau-Thierry and the one-hour train trip from Paris was a startling reminder of how close the Germans got to Paris in 1914 and in 1918.         ChÃ¢teau-Thierry is a pleasant if unremarkable town and the amiable local taxi driver whom Id hired ahead knew the best ways to get me to places on my wish list. We started at the small American Methodist Church in town dedicated in 1924 which has a memorial tablet to American Protestants killed in 1917-18 and a stained-glass window showing the Marquis de Lafayette greeting Gen. John J. Pershing. That sounded irresistible but despite the Open sign it was closed; the only bit of bad luck I encountered.                Also in T Magazine »

At the time my ethnicity list was a personal torment. Id ask my parents if we could please be French. Or Italian. Anything as long as it was just one thing.         Being a half  or in my case a handful  can still be complicated as Paula J. Freedman makes plain in My Basmati Bat Mitzvah her candy-colored first novel about a New York Hin-Jew meaning in this case a girl whose mother is Hindu and whose father is Jewish.         At 12 Tara Feinstein lives casually in both cultures. She sprinkles chaat masala on popcorn and loves matzo ball soup. A small statue of Ganesh the Hindu god sits on her dresser and she actually enjoys Hebrew school  or at least she did. Now she has to plan her bat mitzvah and she isnt sure she wants one.         Why was I doing this? she asks. Her mother a convert admires Judaism from afar. Her father has not been to temple in twelve hundred years. Her Gran is observant but who knows what she really believes. Then theres Ben-o her lifelong pal and possible boyfriend. Hes a Catholic; would a bat mitzvah pry them apart?         Theres a trickier problem the same one Judy Blume explored in her 1970 classic Are You There God? Its Me Margaret. Tara isnt sure whether she believes in God. And she cant discuss that with her parents. (Theyve booked the hall.) She tells her best friend Rebecca who changes the subject. Ben-o says she might go to hell. Imitating a Bollywood star she covers her face wailing Nahee! Its an enemy Sheila Rosenberg who finally helps her make a decision. Im surprised youre having one Tara she says. Youre not even Jewish. Technically.         Thats it. Shes having one. But shes not inviting Sheila. From there the novel moves swiftly toward what Vijay her faux-gangsta cousin calls the bazmatzah thing. And despite an inventive collection of crises (such as accidentally burning a treasured sari) she ends up exactly where she needs to be.         True Freedman makes a few wrong turns along the way. A section on Taras Robotics Club goes nowhere. Theres too much Sheila and not enough Ben-o. And some characters are cardboard cutouts. Gran who must be only in her 60s sounds like an Old World bubbe on an ancient Â­sitcom.         None of this really detracts from Taras quest to determine finally just who she is. If everything was open to discussion she concludes then just maybe there were no wrong answers  nothing to stop her from being an ordinary Jewish girl with a sprinkling of masala on top.         Mira in the Present Tense (published in England as Artichoke Hearts) by Sita Brahmachari is a lyrical more serious novel about another Hin-Jew this one British and focused less on the Indian Jewish thing than on the awfulness of turning 12.         Mira Levensons family has gathered for her birthday at the home of her grandmother Nana Josie a bohemian artist who quotes Frida Kahlo. They all know Nana Josie is very ill but they dont know shes ordered a coffin until it arrives unexpectedly at Miras party. Stunned standing between a pink cake and a casket Mira gets her first period. Things get even weirder when Nana asks her to help paint a landscape on the coffin.         Like Tara Mira has an overinvolved Jewish father and a loving if distracted Indian mother. And like Tara Mira isnt sure what she believes addressing questions to a power she calls Notsurewho Notsurewhat. Turning 12 has made her anxious: It feels like Im walking a tightrope she says. Something is happening to me right now. Present tense.         Tara may have cured her multiple ethnicity disorder but Miras problem is more diffuse. She must learn to live inside that present tense overcoming her shyness and her fear of engaging with others  even the dying. As Nana says most people grow tough little shells around their hearts like the outside layers of an artichoke. Mira she hopes will stay open and strong but still tender like an artichoke as you come closer to the heart.         Betsy Israel is the author of the teenage memoir Grown-Up Fast and Bachelor Girl a cultural history of single women. The Mythology Project her first young adult novel comes out next year.

Proceed at your own risk.   How great would it be if Walt was about to use the ricin and someone random blew his head off and the show ended with a pull away from his dead body?         Thus read the text of an email from Jeff a lawyer friend of mine sent five days before the Breaking Bad finale which aired last month. Jeff is smart and he loves the same TV shows that I love which gives us a lot to talk about over the course of these fraught intense TV seasons. But the interim-episode emails between Jeff and me can be treacherous; they are the Wild West of my inbox. There are no rules to these emails save one: They can contain no spoilers  spoilers of course being plot points of a show shared by people who have heard whats going to happen in advance or have seen the show before you have.         Jeff and I (and the other people randomly c.c.d on these emails like his wife or my husband or a neighbor named David) are adamantly against spoilers. We would label any messages that even hint at previous or even day-after knowledge loudly in the subject line  were not savages after all.         But our emails arent made up of plot points and did-you-see-that?s. The content of these emails is primarily speculation. Jeff sees nothing wrong with a week spent guessing what might happen on the next episode.         The only problem  and this realization peaked for me about five days before the Breaking Bad finale  is that lately I want nothing to do with those emails.          Jeffs favorite thing  to do is to try to predict what might happen to any TV show as it comes to its season  or even better series  finale. The fact that hes a lawyer is important because it means that hes generally good at poking holes in theories and remembering hints and pieces of evidence I have long since forgotten. Its even more important to note that hes an entertainment lawyer here in Los Angeles which means that when he suggests theories like this Walter White-ricin one outlined above I have to concern myself with whether his email might have something to do with inside knowledge  the pop-culture equivalent of a seemingly random notion dropped casually by a stockbroker friend that might eventually lead to an insider-trading charge.         Do you know something? I typed in my reply to him which may have been in capital letters. If you do and you just said it Im never speaking to you again.         How could I possibly? he answered. Later he sent me a remarkably well thought out series of endgame scenarios. The Nazis win. Walt wins. Jesse wins. It was all a dream. A random car crash kills all the main characters  because sometimes thats just how life works.         Some of this speculation was wild guessing for the sake of wild guessing and some of it was rooted in the hard evaluation of evidence: Why for example were Walt and Jesse pictured on the cover of Entertainment Weekly covered in blood and dirt? Clearly the series ends in a great cloud of blood! And dirt!         Either way I open each of Jeffs emails with great hesitation. Hes just doing what the rest of the Internet is doing: guessing publicly. A different friend sent me a blog post that examines a few possible outcomes. I immediately deleted it. Friends emailed me prediction after prediction from Entertainment Weekly articles all of which were probably incredibly insightful. I trashed them all unread. New York magazines culture site Vulture seemed to be all Breaking Bad all the time. So I unfollowed it on both Twitter and Facebook.         As we adjust to a new climate of TV  one in which each season of a popular show is dissected in real time in an incessant ongoing conversation on the Internet  I realize my fresh predicament: I have been longing for this cultural moment one in which my obsessive love for TV is vindicated. Yet now I find I cant escape these conversations quickly enough. The more adept I get at Twitter the more of Jeffs emails I receive the more Entertainment Weekly issues I pore over the less I enjoy the actual show when its actually on.         I cant deny how much fun it is to talk over a TV show to think and overthink and then overthink the overthinking. But anticipation of what  might  happen is now as fearsome to me as information about what  did  happen. Speculation is the new spoiler.                Also in Video »       
347,100000002533536,0,Article,News,Magazine,magazine,,Who Made That College Application?,JESSICA GROSS,689,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/magazine/who-made-that-college-application.html,21,In the late 1800s elite colleges admitted students from private schools based on entrance exams in Latin and Greek. State schools let in almost everyone who graduated from high schools certified by the universities professors. It wasnt until private colleges opened their admissions to public school students that anyone saw the need for an application. There were more students than the schools could serve and administrators noted with dismay that selecting based on academic merit alone dangerously increased the percentage of Jewish students.          In 1919 Columbia University unveiled the first modern college application. The eight-page form requested among other things a photograph religious affiliation and mothers maiden name in full. Harvard Yale and Princeton created their own forms as Jerome Karabel details in his book The Chosen requesting photographs and instituting personal interviews. As one admiring Harvard board member put it there was consequently no Jew question at Princeton.         The character-based application spread from the Northeast across the country. It eventually evolved into what became known as the Common Application which began in 1975 and currently serves 517 colleges. Where the application was initially devised to exclude it now serves to include. Schools not just applicants want to be well rounded. The Common Application gives students the option of including religious preference and race (please indicate how you identify yourself).         There have however been drawbacks to relying on a single form. This year the Common App came under fire for the glitches in its new online system: credit cards or essays werent accepted; information had to be entered two or three times. Colleges were forced to extend their early-decision deadlines and some reverted to paper applications. The Common App officials got almost as much flak for changing the essay question: We got some criticism when we said we were going to get rid of topic of your choice  says Scott Anderson director of policy for the Common Application but its so open-ended that unless students are very skilled writers theyre hindered by the lack of focus.         Many schools continue to require supplementary material. Columbia: List the publications you read regularly including print and electronic sources. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill: What do you hope to find over the rainbow? Thats because applications dont just filter students  theyre meant to attract them too. As the University of Chicagos website proclaims U. Chicagos provocative essay questions are almost as well known as our Nobel laureates  and at least as entertaining.          COLLEGE PREP    Lee Bierer is an independent college counselor in North Carolina.    What do most applicants tend to have trouble with? Â The biggest area is the essay brainstorming. Most of them have not been taught to write using I. And if you look at the Common App essay- prompts this year thats what theyre all about: where students have come from whats unique about them.          Why do parents seek you out?Â  A lot of parents want peace in the home. Parents always say: If I had asked them to do that they never would have done it!          Do you work mostly with highly motivated students or with students who need to present a checkered scholastic record in a better light?Â  I would say most of the students are very motivated. I have an occasional one who has a blip or doesnt present the upward trajectory in grades that colleges would like to see.          How do you advise students whose grades or scores arent great?Â  More than anything I ask them to be honest and if theyve had an incident to deal with it and perhaps share why their grades werent what they expected.          You start working with some students in ninth grade. How do you advise them at that point? Â I have them complete a brag-sheet template. It has extracurricular activities community service honors scholarships and awards summer experiences internships job shadowing and employment. We see where are the gaps? They dont have to fill in everything  were not trying to have them be a jack-of-all-trades  but help them see: What are they passionate about? Where would they like to spend their time?                Also in Video »

Calmly she took the ribbon from me. I do sew she told me. A British woman named Mrs. Piggott taught her how 40 years before in India. I had never heard of her. At that age I preferred stories set firmly in the American West.          Growing up in Casper I idolized Ma Ingalls in the Little House on the Prairie books. Ma made rag dolls and taught her daughter Laura to make an intricate Dove in the Window quilt. Ma let the kids roast a pigs tail. She grew their vegetables in a garden and sewed all their clothes. My own mother bought our clothes at the mall. She didnt allow pork in the house and mostly cooked curry. The saris she wore didnt require needlework.         When I was 12 determined to learn the skills of a good homemaker I joined 4-H. Our group was called the Bakers Dozen and all year we learned a fairly antiquated set of skills  we baked bread sewed made preserves and cross-stitched. Our goal as we worked through the winter was to get ready for the county fair in the summer and if we did well the State Fair. Our leader taught us domestic skills and at the end led us in the 4-H pledge:   I pledge my head to clearer thinking my heart to greater loyalty my hands to larger service and my health to better living for my club my community my country and my world. And every week when I went home I grumbled that my mother didnt know how to bake cookies. She didnt quilt or crochet. She was no pioneer.         I had spent that spring carefully sewing straight stitches and redoing the yoke of my shirt several times. It was a simple outfit made of calico with yellow daisies patterned on it. I worked on it at my 4-H leaders house and my mother never saw the outfit until I walked down the makeshift runway in the fashion show at the fairgrounds winning the pink ribbon. Afterward we walked around the midway eating fry bread and funnel cakes. My stomach was sick from the fried food and from riding roller coasters. I snapped at my mom.         Why cant you sew? I shouted. Why cant you be like the other mothers?         Standing there in the middle of the noisy fair I finally discovered that my mother was quite the homemaker  only she learned to make the wrong kind of home. She grew up in Chennai then known as Madras and she went to an Anglo-Indian school. She was just 7 when India became independent and her school was still a holdover from British times. Many of the teachers were British and each Indian girl in her class took domestic science. From British ladies they learned to manage a home in the British way.         They learned to do things that their counterparts in England were taught despite the absurdities. My mother could make a Madeira cake though at home she had no oven. She knew how to whip eggs for a blancmange and how to make calfs-foot jelly in case she needed to feed an invalid. Like most Indians my mother never touched beef at home. They were taught to make a bed with a top sheet and crisp hospital corners. At home she slept on a reed mat. She learned how to do a complete spring and summer cleaning how to air a room and how to make a mustard poultice.         My mother had been holding my pink ribbon and she handed it back to me. Its good you know how to sew she said. Your outfit is beautiful. Its good to have skills. You never know when youll need them.         She had come a long way from living in India to standing with me at a county fair in Wyoming. She had skills she would never use and many that as time went on she would learn and adapt for her new life in America. She would learn to make us spaghetti to take me to ski practice driving on icy roads and even to help me make the sheets look neat on my water bed.         Eventually I came to understand that my Laura Ingalls Wilder fantasy was foolish. Life was awful for most women on the prairie. Besides wed probably never have been friends because I was brown the daughter of a pioneer whose journey West required more than Ma Ingalls could ever know.

350,100000002533524,0,Article,Question,Magazine,magazine,,Is It Wrong to Steer Business Away From a Philanderer?,CHUCK KLOSTERMAN,529,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/magazine/is-it-wrong-to-steer-business-away-from-a-philanderer.html,20, I manage a boutique retail shop and buy my products from various local distributors. I have never felt it wrong to steer business away from sales reps who serviced our account poorly or were too pushy and rude. Is it wrong however to steer business away from a rep who has always done a very good job and who was actually a good friend but who has done something that I find reprehensible? The offense being that he cheated on his wife.  NAME WITHHELDÂ CONNECTICUT          You ask whether steering business away from a philanderer is wrong. Thats difficult to parse in these circumstances because it seems as if two different questions are in play simultaneously. The first is Is it  ethically acceptable  to make this decision? The second question is Is it  reasonable  to make this decision? I think the first answer is (definitely) yes and the second answer is (probably) no.         Youre operating a for-profit business. Its not a charitable democratic entity  youre not responsible for making sure every sales rep has an equal opportunity to earn a living. You can decide which reps you do business with and you get to dictate the criteria for which business relationships you intend to foster. The fact that you have a standard for which individuals you choose to interact with  only efficient polite people who dont cheat on their wives  suggests that morals inform how you operate your enterprise. This is all good. So if this infidelity is something you feel strongly about I dont see any ethical problem with jettisoning this sales rep from your day-to-day work life. You can steer your business away from anyone you dont feel comfortable with assuming your bias isnt discriminatory toward an entire class of people.         That said I dont think this is a particularly rational decision. Judging from your letter Im inferring that you were once friends with this sales rep which is how you learned these problematic details about his marital life. If you want to end your interpersonal friendship on account of those indiscretions thats totally justified. But your business relationship is different. Do you fear that his inability to be faithful to his wife means he will be unscrupulous toward everyone else he encounters? Do you believe people who cheat on their spouses need to be punished by the rest of the society? Are you certain this secondhand information is 100 percent accurate? Those are all extreme positions to adopt. Moreover your lack of intimate knowledge about other sales reps doesnt mean they are not crossing the same ethical lines you have drawn for this man. Maybe theyre all having affairs.         Now I realize theres a very reasonable response to my argument: Sure I cant know  everything  about everyone I work with. But I do know this specific thing about this specific guy and I dont want him around because of it. But if this is going to be your policy you will need to ask some difficult questions about yourself all your employees and everyone you do business with. Your moral rules should not apply exclusively to the one person who broke them most vividly.

351,100000002527385,0,Article,Review,Books,books,review,No Man’s Land,BETSY BIRD,991,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/great-american-dust-bowl-and-donner-dinner-party.html,38,In his great poem Dont Cry Darling Its Blood All Right Ogden Nash skewers the notion that children want to read books that are comforting and sweet: Hard-boiled sophisticated adults like me and you / May enjoy ourselves thoroughly with Little Women and Winnie-the-Pooh / But innocent infants these titles from their reading course eliminate / As soon as they discover that it was honey and nuts and mashed potatoes instead of human flesh that Winnie-the-Pooh and Little Women ate.         Published in the 1951 collection Parents Keep Out Nashs poem might as well be discussing the 21st-century child: tastes havent changed so much as they have diversified. Once children had to sate their bloodthirsty natures with fiction; now the trend in nonfiction is to bring them history at its most dire. This season Don Brown and Nathan Hale use impressive artistry to recount two of the American Wests most infamous tragedies in graphic-novel form. And yes little children there will be blood.         In the more serious of the two The Great American Dust Bowl Brown uses pen ink and then a whole oceans worth of digital brown paint to explain how Americas heartland became in the 1930s a vast barren plain. Brown eschews easy answers and instead offers readers a variety of causes including the destruction of the bison a farming boom followed by a postwar drop in wheat prices drought the Depression and finally dust itself. Beaten-down farm folk populate Browns pages describing their experiences during the Dust Bowl years. It made the awfulest noise that dirt did. Brown provides meticulous credits for these quotations in the books source notes but leaves the speakers nameless and in his minimalist drawing style almost faceless.         Freezing winters boiling summers and bugs so thick and so bad that you could swipe handfuls of them off the table and still have more made the farmers everyday lives virtually unbearable. By the time Brown describes people suffocating to death in the dust storms readers are staggering under the sheer weight of relentless human misery. Yet while Browns narrative focuses on extreme woes theres something curiously undramatic about his illustrations. Its as if he wants to rein in the atrocious elements of his story even as he brings them to light. You come to wonder if his reluctance to heighten the action with more exciting pictures is part of a refusal to sensationalize. Even a farmer running to escape a black cloud who recalls thinking it was the last day of the world wears an expression of mild distress as if he had a bit of a cramp in his side rather than the gut-wrenching fear of an approaching storm said to contain enough static electricity to power New York City.         Donner Dinner Party is as it boasts dire and disgusting but a testament to the human will to survive. The book is the third in a series with an inherently ridiculous  though entertaining  premise. Nathan Hale (the historical figure a spy during the Revolution) has been given the gift of seeing Americas future. While waiting to be hanged he tells tales to his hangman and the British provost marshal in order to postpone his inevitable death. The two previous Hazardous Tales  One Dead Spy and Big Bad Ironclad!  were set during the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. Hale now moves on to the tragedy of the Donner Party a group of emigrants who left Illinois for California in 1846 and were forced to spend the winter in the Sierra Nevada where about half of them died and some are said to have resorted to cannibalism in order to survive.         For those readers who assumed the horrors of the Donner Party began and ended with the conspicuous consumption of human flesh the spate of attacks murders and other tragedies along the way will come as a surprise. One notable aspect of this book  aside from the graphic-novel format  is how Hale tackles the actual eating of people. Its clear that to the hangman (a childlike figure who is a perfect stand-in for young readers) the prospect of eating pets to stay alive is more unnerving than the idea of eating people. You can eat 65-year-old Jacob Donner sure but dont you  dare  take a nibble out of Towser the pup!         The end of the book yields fascinating facts including a grid showing who died who survived the causes of their deaths and whether or not they were cannibalized. Theres also a flow chart tracking how likely you the reader would be to survive the trip based on your age sex and the size of your family.         Because Hales books are full of imagined dialogue they cant be strictly categorized as nonfiction but theres clearly plenty of research behind them. He addresses this question directly in a section called Correction Baby. (If youve got questions comments or corrections shes got answers!) As to whether James Reed one of the emigrant party was as wacky as he is depicted in the book Hale says I think our portrayal of Reed is cartoony but fair. Its probably safe to assume that holds for most of the history here.         Of the two graphic novels Browns is clearly more dedicated to using strictly sourced facts to weave an accurate historical narrative. Hale on the other hand is happy to jump back and forth in time using the characters of Hale the spy the hangman and the provost marshal to keep things lively. And while Brown does his best most children will probably prefer Hales blood-soaked adventures over Browns careful and grim account of an environmental catastrophe.         Nash knew this writing with prescience: Therefore I say unto you all you poets who are so crazy about meek and mild little children and their angelic air / If you are sincere and really want to please them why just go out and get yourselves devoured by a bear.         Betsy Bird is a librarian and the author of the picture book Giant Dance Party. She is a co-author of Wild Things!: Acts of Mischief in Childrens Literature to be published in April 2014.
352,100000002540825,0,Article,Review,Books,books,review,Daring Deeds,MARJORIE INGALL,630,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/treasure-hunters-and-the-very-nearly-honorable-league-of-pirates.html,37,What with all the attacks by gnarly surfer pirates scuba ninjas and unctuous underwater TV hosts Treasure Hunters sure makes sailing sound exhausting. But it cant be as exhausting as being James Patterson who has multiple adult young adult and middle-grade series coming out simultaneously. He does have help. Treasure Hunters Pattersons latest middle-grade novel was written with his frequent collaborator Chris Grabenstein; another writer Mark Shulman and an illustrator Juliana Neufeld are also credited inside. As befits the number of human beings involved the book is pretty jam-packed. The siblings Bick Beck Tommy and Storm have grown up on a 63-foot sailboat helping their father a famous oceanographer dredge up Spanish galleons sunken Ming dynasty pottery and diamond-encrusted Cypriot artifacts. But when their mother disappears in Cyprus and their father is washed overboard the kids have to keep the vessel and the family treasure-Â­hunting business afloat while escaping from all sorts of villains including but not limited to an arms dealer who collects Grecian urns; Ukranian knuckle-draggers; and a vicious coed.         This wild ride is narrated by Bick 12 whose rat-a-tat descriptions of the siblings adventures are accompanied by drawings by his twin sister Beck. These black-and-white illustrations are delightful  reminiscent of the elaborate doodles churned out in math class by the most awesome artist in seventh grade. Enthusiastic crosshatching scribbly storm clouds and jagged lightning bolts burst with energy and I enjoyed the shirtless stylings of girl-crazy super-buff Tommy a 17-year-old who spends a lot of time on personal grooming.         There isnt a lot of emotional heft jazzy writing or deep characterization here and the broad humor often falls flat. Storm who is overweight is called Shamu by some bad guys  indicating that they are bad. And mean. But when Bick makes fat jokes about another character hes just being funny. Worse is Jolly Mon a Cayman captain who speaks in a cringe-Â­inducing patois and has a rumbling Caribbean laugh. Hes Jar Jar the sailor man. But young adrenaline hounds will probably be unfazed.         Meanwhile Caroline Carlsons Very Nearly Honorable League of Pirates is a more languorously paced seafaring adventure. The first page: A drawing of an internship acceptance letter from the titular V.N.H.L.P. (Servin the High Seas for 152 Years according to its letterhead) to Master Hilary Westfield. Then we see Hilarys return letter expressing delight and informing the league that he is in fact a she. The League replies immediately to rescind Hilarys apprenticeship offer to express shock and horror that a girl would want to be a pirate and to inform Hilary that her application has been forwarded to Miss Pimms Finishing School for Delicate Ladies (Where Virtue Blossoms). Over her objections Hilary is enrolled in the fancy-pants school which sends her a copy of Waltzing for the Eager Novice and two cardigans with the schools dancing sheep logo.         Hilary is not the sort of girl to take no for an answer. She and an unlikely confidante a talking stone gargoyle are determined to get on with pirating and plot their escape from Miss Pimms. Along the way we meet a Poppins-esque governess a dashing pirate captain a disengaged and disapproving father a cute first mate a loyal working-class best friend and a boarding school mean girl.         Basically this is a drawing-room comedy set on the high seas. (Hilarys friend wryly remarks I should think sword fighting would be very similar to waltzing only less romantic and with a more gruesome conclusion.) The book is deliciously feminist but wears its politics lightly. Relationships are sweet and beautifully drawn there is at least one laugh per page and I quite enjoyed the notion of entrenched pirate bureaucracy (thats why our dashing captain is freelance).         Also I like the books fancy deckle edge. Its yare.         Marjorie Ingall is a columnist for Tablet magazine.
353,100000002527400,0,Article,Review,Books,books,review,Without a Voice,JENNIFER HUBERT SWAN,740,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/all-the-truth-thats-in-me-by-julie-berry.html,41,We tell young women today to speak up for themselves in matters personal and political but if we look to examples in classical and contemporary literature the results of truth-telling can be dire.         Arguably the most famous heroine to suffer from this danger is tragic Lavinia from Shakespeares bloody Titus Andronicus whose fathers enemies first rape her then cut out her tongue and lop off her hands so she cant expose their identities. Doggedly she uses her mouth and a stick to scrape their names in the dirt but is later murdered for her efforts. In Greek mythology Cassandra rejects Apollos romantic overtures and as punishment he curses her so she will always tell the truth but never be believed. She too is raped in the fall of Troy held captive by Agamemnon and then murdered by his jealous wife. In more recent history Melinda Sordino the stoic protagonist of Laurie Halse Andersons modern young adult classic Speak becomes selectively mute after being raped at a party and spends a year trying to find her voice again. Brutal examples all but which is worse: not to be able to speak or to speak the truth and not be believed?         This is the question Julie Berry raises in her disturbing and provocative first novel for teenagers. Judith the dutiful daughter of what seems to be a Puritan family (Berry sets her tale in a frustratingly vague colonial setting) is 14 when she is abducted from her village. Imprisoned by her captor for two years she returns home with her tongue cut out. Now 18 she is shunned by both family and neighbors who insist on believing her attacker took her maidenhood and view her as a fallen woman. I am shocking. What was done to me was shocking. I am outside the boundaries forever no longer decent.         Resigned to her lot Judith lives on a small farm with her scornful mother and indifferent brother. Her only respite from work and her own dark thoughts is the crush she nurses for Lucas a neighbor and childhood sweetheart.         When her quiet village is attacked by an army of homelanders intent on taking the fertile farmland for themselves Judith is desperate to save Lucas and the men who follow him into a losing battle. She flees to the one place she never wanted to see again: her kidnappers hidden forest lair. Through gestures and grunts she persuades the madman to use his arsenal of gunpowder to blow up the attackers ships. In return she reluctantly offers to become his wife. But when the plan works and the smoke clears her kidnappers corpse lies among those of their adversaries. The mysterious explosives expert is identified as Colonel Whiting Lucass father and a former war hero who was believed to be already dead. Naturally the villagers want to know where in Jesus name he has been and if the dumbfounded Lucas had any knowledge of his fathers deception. But Judith is unable to tell anyone that Whiting was the monster who took her tongue and that Lucas knew nothing.         All these sensational events unfold in just the first quarter of the novel and you might wonder how Berry will maintain suspense after uncovering one of the major plot points of her story so quickly. But many secrets are yet to be divulged and Berry discloses them in fleeting flashbacks that add another layer of tension to Judiths current situation. Judith and Lucass tender romance conveyed mostly through glances gestures and one very chaste night spent together is challenged at every turn by circumstances and the young lovers own conflicting understanding of the truth and lies that surround them. Readers will be kept enjoyably unsettled until all is finally resolved in the very last pages.         Even though society would have us think weve left those tragic characters of female mythology behind Judiths story reminds us of the need to listen for the often voiceless fears girls may be concealing behind their bravado.

L. Konigsburgs From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler the Newbery Medal-winning childrens classic published in 1967. In that wry tale a strong-willed 11-year-old girl and her little brother flee perceived injustices in their comfortable suburban home journeying by commuter train from Connecticut to Manhattan where they take up residence in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They research a Renaissance sculpture of an angel solve the mystery of its provenance and return home in a Rolls-Royce.         Unhooking the Moon the debut young adult novel by the British author Gregory Hughes originally published in Britain in 2010 has some superficial similarities  a rapier-witted young heroine a pragmatic brother swept along by the power of his sisters personality and New York as the Emerald City. But Hughess enterprise is at once darker and more rollicking. The girl at the heart of the book is 10-year-old Marie Claire Wazhashnoons DeBillier a k a the Rat a hilariously precocious force of nature who lives near the city of Winnipeg with her kind but boozy father and her 12-year-old brother Bob on a prairie so flat you can watch your dog run away for three days.         Wazhashnoons we are told is the Native American word for Little Rat the name given to Marie Claire when her French mother now dead gave birth while visiting a reservation. As peculiar as her name the Rat possesses a grab bag of quirks and talents perfectly suited to drive a brother to heights of bewilderment and grudging admiration. She chats fluently in French English Spanish and the local Native tongue is nourished by a dogs breakfast of religious beliefs and is always on the lookout for goddamn pedophiles. She is also clairvoyant a gift her mothers Native friend says of the Great Spirit.         As narrated by Bob the storys straight man the siblings enjoy an idyllic childhood replete with pleasures like traveling to school by canoe. But a dark undercurrent runs through this funny novel. Part and parcel with the Rats shamanic gift are the seizures she suffers frightening bouts from which only the hugs and soothing words of her father seem capable of releasing her.         When the siblings father drops dead (as the Rat predicted he would) the Rat convinces Bob that their only hope of staying out of a childrens home is to head to New York to seek out an estranged uncle reputed to be a drug dealer. As preposterous as this plan sounds Bob concludes it is his sisters best hope: She couldnt handle being put in a home. Shes crazy and theyd try to make her normal.         Although the Rat seems more kooky than disturbed her mental condition eventually becomes the books central concern: The girl is touched but is she touched by genius madness or both? As the answer reveals itself the dynamic between the siblings shifts. While the Rats openhearted impetuousness drives their headlong journey Bob gradually becomes less of a sidekick and more of a protector soothing his sister while she writhes in agony during intensifying fits.         Once the pair reach New York the book loses some of its magic. There are adventures with likable oddballs but Gotham is not particularized as successfully as Winnipeg and the result is something of a foreigners fantasy of New York City. The problem is not just Hughess occasional factual error like the two tickets to the Bronx they buy in the subway but also his reliance on stereotypes. Although the rap artist they befriend is a fresh character others feel creakier like the streetwise Italian hustler and all the Irish doormen named Patrick Sean or Connor.         The occasional cartoonishness of the supporting characters is at odds with the very real perils the children confront. At times the novel feels inappropriately jocular for a story that takes on the deeply unamusing subjects of mental illness and child abuse. Near the end Unhooking the Moon veers unexpectedly into violence and tragedy. This disturbing turn may be jarring to some readers and refreshingly unformulaic to others. But the denouement is poignantly wrought concluding on a note despite the darkness of hope and fraternal love.         John Freeman Gill writes regularly about New York for The Times.

But action is first and foremost in The Living. At times with its pharmaceutical intrigue man in a black suit stalking the hero ship-destroying tsunami high body count and fight for survival on a lifeboat the plot reads as if it were concocted by a Hollywood studio. The pitch meeting could have gone something like this: Its Andromeda Strain meets Titanic meets Life of Pi (without the tiger). You can almost hear the script doctors bursting into the writers room shouting Add man-Â­eating sharks! or Make sure the chandelier falls on the bad guy!         The book opens with an ominous prologue. While working on the honeymoon deck of the cruise ship Shy offers a bottle of water to a middle-aged man who begins a rambling confession involving betrayal a letter in a cave and blood on his hands. Remember this cowardly face the man tells Shy. Its what corruption looks like. When Shy turns his back to serve other passengers the man clambers over a side rail; as he jumps overboard Shy tries to save him but is left clutching his empty sleeve. With a storm brewing out at sea he seeks comfort and friendship  and maybe something more  with Carmen a fellow Mexican-American crew member whose father recently died from Romero disease a mysterious illness that also killed Shys grandmother.         Racial and class bigotry thrive on the ship. A rich oilman asks Carmen where she is from and when she replies San Diego he presses Originally I mean. And a stuck-up blond teenager traveling with her father and best friend threatens to post a photo of the friend and Shy online with the caption Cassie and her pool boy.         De la PeÃ±a can uncork delicate but vivid sentences as when Shy and Carmen talk about the deaths in their families. It went quiet between them for a few long seconds. A shared feeling of loss hanging in the air like gas. Describing the approaching storm de la PeÃ±a writes that Shy watched it all in awe for several minutes the world lining up exactly with his insides.         When de la PeÃ±a addresses his admirable themes of inequality and racism however his prose feels clichÃ©d. Discussing the spread of the mysterious disease with Carmen Shy starts to understand that some peoples lives mattered more than others. And when the plot takes a formulaic turn into disaster the first-class passengers shout that they paid for the right to board lifeboats first (paging James Cameron).         Shy ends up adrift in a lifeboat with the blond girl and the oilman. When one of them dies Shy ruminates on the fact that everyones days were numbered and it didnt matter if you were in premier class or worked in housekeeping an observation that lands with a thud.         The breathless conclusion with an escape by helicopter and a cliff-top showdown sets up a sequel scheduled to be published next year  maybe just in time for a movie version of The Living.         Motoko Rich reports on national K-12 education at The Times.
356,100000002527476,0,Article,Review,Books,books,review,What You’re Made Of,CHELSEY PHILPOT,617,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/the-real-boy-by-anne-ursu.html,33,Anne Ursu the author of Breadcrumbs has written a lovely and sophisticated new middle-grade fantasy that asks readers to wrap their heads around abstractions and accept a lack of absolutes. There is no one bad guy people are simultaneously greedy and miraculous and even a monster deserves understanding. In The Real Boy magic is unruly and legends feel steady under the feet until a new bit of information rolls in like thunder and unsettles history.         Eleven-year-old Oscar is a hand to Master Caleb the first magician in a generation on the island of Aletheia. The odd boys quiet life is dictated by routine which suits him just fine. He collects flowers and herbs for his master to make into charms and potions to sell to the inhabitants of the Barrow Village and the privileged people from Asteri the Shining City. He spends the rest of his time avoiding the cruel apprentice Wolf taking care of a menagerie of cats and sneaking into the magicians enormous library.         Oscars predictable life begins to fall apart when Master Caleb goes to the continent to sell his enchanted wares and Wolf is killed by something large and hungry in the woods. The adults of the Barrow dont want to believe that a monster is attacking them so Oscar and his friend Callie the headstrong healers apprentice must uncover the truth behind Aletheias magic on their own. Why was a terrible plague able to cause so many deaths years ago? Why did the wizards of old turn themselves into guardian trees? And why are the children of Asteri who are supposed to be perfect coming apart like paper dolls left in the rain?         Oscar  who has trouble looking people in the eye and reading emotions  is forced by Callie and by circumstance to help the sick city children. I cannot understand what people mean when they talk he tells Malcolm an ex-magician. I am not . . . Im not made of the same thing as everyone else. But what sets Oscar apart (his methodical knowledge of plants his ability to create maps of information in his head) also enables him to become a hero.         The Real Boy contains delicate allusions to The Adventures of Pinocchio by the 19th-century Italian author Carlo Collodi (magical wood also plays a role in this story) and is rich with beautiful heady notions that demand to be lingered over: If the earth can be saturated with enchantment then a city can be scarred with grief. Magic is a natural force that serves at no ones pleasure but its own. And truth punches you in the stomach as it puts its loving arm around your shoulder.         Readers will need to go slowly both to savor Ursus descriptions and to avoid confusion. As Oscar and Callie try to understand their history and why Aletheias magic is losing strength they develop and discard theories the way citizens of Asteri might throw away old charms but those who stay with their mission will be aptly rewarded.         Ultimately Oscar must make a daring and self-sacrificial effort to get rid of the monster for good. It takes an act of great bravery to free him from self-doubt. He goes from being a puppet with no master to a real boy indeed.         In Aletheia as in the real world it turns out to be a beautiful lie . . . that you could have magic without monsters. And so destructively true that small enchantments make us dream of big ones. Perhaps as Malcolm suggests instead of relying on magic its better we dream of a big world  a world that has plenty of space for odd unexpected heroes like Oscar.         Chelsey Philpot is an editor at School Library Journal. Her first young adult novel Even in Paradise will appear in the fall of 2014.
357,100000002527430,0,Article,Review,Books,books,review,Acting Like Animals,CAROLYN JURIS,1050,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/how-to-hide-a-lion-by-helen-stephens-and-more.html,34,Its not always easy to follow your heart. It can mean challenging the status quo defying others expectations or sometimes discovering that those harboring strong preconceptions had you pegged correctly all along. And while children learn early on that a leopard cant change his spots its equally important to remember that each pattern is unique. Three new picture books explore the nuances of individuality through the exploits of feral creatures who arent always what they appear to be  except of course when they are.         In the opening pages of Mr. Tiger Goes Wild the author-illustrator Peter Brown depicts his hero as a bright pop of orange in a sepia-toned quasi-Victorian city of bipedal deer and penny-farthing-riding squirrels clad in top hats starched collars and overcoats. The stiffly anthropomorphized creatures maintain smug sniffy expressions as they raise teacups greet one another tepidly and admonish playful young rhinos bears and pigs not to act like wild animals. (Though his emerald-eyed stoic expression never wavers Mr. Tiger clearly gets the irony.)         As Brown showed in 2009s The Curious Garden in which a small patch of urban green tended by a determined boy named Liam eventually transforms an entire city a revolution can begin with a single small act of defiance. One day Mr. Tiger gets the very wild idea to adopt an all-fours stance and things quickly progress: soon hes scaling row houses and skinny-dipping in the public fountain. A two-page spread shows just how far hes come  wearing nothing but his stripes he puffs out his chest and meets the readers gaze with a slightly surprised and utterly joyful Here I am! expression.         When his fed-up fellow citizens sternly suggest that if he must continue this behavior he kindly do so in the wilderness! the newly liberated cat complies with gusto. What a magnificent idea! he roars gleefully escaping to a Rousseau-like tableau of dense ferns soaring palms and cascading waterfalls. (Whether by coincidence or design Henri Rousseaus 1891 painting Tiger in a Tropical Storm [Surprised!] marked the debut of the artists famed jungle scenes earning him the first serious review of his career.) Magnificent solitude has its price however and Mr. Tiger soon arrives at a second revelation: He missed his friends. He missed the city. He missed his home. The return journey is a lesson in compromise which isnt the same thing as defeat. Rather Mr. Tiger chooses a middle path and his neighbors meet him halfway.         How to Hide a Lion finds another wild animal in an environment intolerant of his very nature. Originally published in Britain the story begins innocently enough: One hot day a lion strolled into town to buy a hat. The noble beast has a curious friendly look about the face but one glance at the fearful townsfolk  this being a conventionally real-world burg inhabited by human beings  tells the reader that the excursion will not go as planned. As startled by the defensive villagers as they are terrified of him the lion runs off and lands in the backyard of a girl named Iris who as luck would have it wasnt scared of lions. Using a nostalgic style and subdued palette reminiscent of midcentury Little Golden Books masters like Richard Scarry  whose cover for 1956s Winky Dink also featured a honey-hued lion offset by a similar robins-egg-blue background  the author-illustrator Helen Stephens shows how the pairs friendship develops just outside the myopic view of Iriss parents even as the girls mother lounges barefoot in her armchair reading a tabloid with the front-page headline Lion on the Run. Despite the endless capacity for cluelessness among the adults in childrens books Iris and the lion are eventually found out and the great cat flees.         From here the plot follows a reassuringly familiar path: the lion hides in plain sight downtown between two Patience-and-Fortitude-like stone cousins a vantage point that allows him to keep an eye on Iris and on the town hall. When two burglars break in and steal every single one of the mayors candlesticks the lion pounces nabbing the thieves and redeeming his reputation. Stephens wraps up her story neatly with an affectionate callback to its very first page. Iriss gentle admonishment to her parents  I told you he was a kind lion  feels less a rebuke than a reminder to approach the unknown not with prejudgment but with an open heart.         As in Stephenss tale the central characters of Carnivores suffer from a public relations problem  though in this case theyve earned it. Fractured fairy tales and subverted expectations pervade childrens literature but as much as we may want to sympathize with Aaron Reynoldss beleaguered lion when the wildebeests call him bad kitty  the fact remains: Hes eaten half the neighborhood. The great white shark is wounded by talk of feeding frenzies; after all he claims (unconvincingly) hes simply a fast eater. These two along with the timber wolf who  almost  never eats little girls make a radical decision: Well go vegetarian! Meeting in an A.A.-like setting complete with desperately clutched coffee mugs and chalk-scrawled slogans like 29 Days Without Meat the carnivore support groups efforts nonetheless fail. The wolf tries to survive on a diet of berries but every single berry bush seemed to have a bunny inside. The shark determined to eat only seaweed finds it leaves a horrible kelpy aftertaste in his mouth.         Despite the predators ongoing efforts their carnivorous tendencies assert themselves with renewed zeal. Dan Santats animation background  he created the Disney television series The Replacements  manifests in his wild-eyed mixed-media illustrations which look as though they could bound right off the page and onto the screen. Reynolds who pulled off a lighthearted Whos the real monster? twist at the end of 2012s Creepy Carrots (illustrated with Hitchcockian verve by Peter Brown) here takes a turn for the dark  and then goes darker still. A clue may be found in his author bio which confesses six years of vegetarianism followed by the veritable zoo of animals hes consumed since. This is no sweet story of finding ones muse or looking beyond appearances; instead Carnivores puts a somewhat macabre spin on the follow your heart theme and it also imparts a corollary: Listen to your stomach.         Carolyn Juris is associate childrens book Â­editor at Publishers Weekly.

When she faces the apparent failure of her efforts only halfway through the first day of school she quickly replaces that plan with another: Shell commit suicide.         At home accompanied by a playlist of songs she wouldnt mind dying to she cuts her wrist with her fathers X-Acto knife and calls a classmate who in turn calls for help. I didnt really want to die Elise explains in narration. All I ever wanted was attention. Spurred in part by the frequency with which teenage suicides have been linked to bullying young adult literature has evolved to tackle increasingly life-or-death issues.         By comparison the anti-Â­bullying touchstone of my youth was Judy Blumes Blubber in which a classroom of fifth graders torments a girl who doesnt quite fit in. Its an important harrowing book about crowd-think and cruelty but published in 1974 it comes without talk of suicide self-harm or the Internet as a medium for abuse. Nearly 40 years later the way authors address bullying has changed but childrens books remain uniquely positioned to provide support to generate conversations and to deliver powerful doses of empathy and hope through realistic portrayals.         In This Song Will Save Your Life Elise is a mostly relatable misfit trapped by a feeling nearly everyone has experienced: I dont belong here. I dont know how I got here and I dont know how long I can stay before Â­everyone else realizes that I am an impostor. I am a fraud. Seven months after she cuts her wrist Elise has returned to a kind of normal albeit one that includes sneaking out at night and walking for hours in the dark with her beloved iPod as a form of escape. I listen to music as loud as I can and I dont think about anything she says. On one such meandering she stumbles upon an underground dance party named Start  aptly so as its a place where she can begin anew away from the paralyzing paradigms of high school. She returns again and again acquiring like-minded friends and a sort-of boyfriend who teaches her to D.J. after her raw talent becomes apparent. Soon enough shes D.J.-ing on her own making a hundred people dance. . . . I Elise using my own power had made people happy.         Yet her words at the beginning of the book come back too. Change can feel downright impossible particularly when she learns her whole school thinks shes started a blog about wanting to kill herself (she hasnt). There are times when Elise seems almost too likable for her outcast status but misfit is in the eye of the beholder and she may be her own harshest critic. Her struggle not just to alter what others see but also to find what she wants to see is a poignÂ­ant reminder that the current presiding perspective is not everyÂ­thing; that there are other opinions and new opportunities for acceptance and joy; that people can and do change no matter how hard it seems.         This Song Will Save Your Life ends with a list of recommended listening from Sales songs by Belle and Sebastian Bruce Springsteen Erasure the Cure the Smiths and others. Like Blubber many of these tracks  music the retro-Â­inclined Elise herself might play  hail from an earlier time. The emotional resonance of Elises journey however feels very much of the moment.         Jen Dolls memoir Save the Date will be published in May.
359,100000002527423,0,Article,Review,Books,books,review,In the Beginning,TAFFY BRODESSER-AKNER,1010,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/with-a-mighty-hand-and-the-barefoot-book-of-jewish-tales.html,36,The Old Testament is not the cuddliest of books: it contains murder rape heresy and all other manner of sin and misbehavior  hardly what we want our children to learn first about their religion. And its not the most accessible either. Its crowded with genealogy and tangents and written in a style thats hard to understand. Yet what can we do? We Jews have only this one set of Scriptures to go on. Two new books provide sometimes unconventional interpretations of the Torah and Jewish folklore and with them a view into what their authors find to be the most exciting and poignant parts of the traditional texts.         With a Mighty Hand: The Story in the Torah is an adaptation in somewhat modernized English. The author Amy Ehrlich has kept the best-told tales  Adam and Eve Abraham and Sarah Joseph and his brothers Moses and Pharaoh for a start  and set aside the laws and lists that make Leviticus for instance a challenge to read.         Its a beautiful book to look at; Daniel Nevinss paintings are lively and provocative. Ive never seen a more arresting manifestation of Jacobs all-night wrestling match; I looked at the rainbow illustration of the burning bush for a full minute before turning the page. And I was interested to see that Nevins portrays the people of the Torah with dark skin and full lips more likely to be historically accurate than the usual European renderings.         The book is far easier to read and more direct than the actual Torah but the language of Ehrlichs free verse is still not quite ordinary speech which makes for a bit of work. And to me it felt a little audacious of Ehrlich to decide what exactly in the Torah is worth telling  though that could be my rigid Orthodox education at work. But it struck me that it would have been nice growing up to have a volume like With a Mighty Hand: visually pleasing and stripped of confusing matter that could threaten any childs understanding attention span and ultimate captivation. With a Mighty Hand is a great transitional Torah  something between an illustrated book of Bible stories for children and the full heft of the actual Five Books of Moses still told in its own words on its own terms making what was once intimidating palatable.         The Barefoot Book of Jewish Tales by Rabbi Shoshana Boyd Gelfand isnt a book of Bible stories but of time-honored Jewish folklore about prophets and kings and righteous people. In one tale a boy who loves letters cant learn to read. One Yom Kippur he sits in the back of the synagogue and cuts out Hebrew letters. When his father catches him he screams at the boy for cutting letters instead of praying for forgiveness and announces how ashamed he is. Suddenly the cut letters float up and turn into words which yield the most inspiring prayers these Jews have ever seen. The boy is forgiven for he has taught the congregation that everyone has a contribution to make even if that contribution isnt obvious.         In another story a virtuous womans reward for her good life is the ability to visit heaven and hell prematurely to see how all this ends up. She finds that denizens of both are saddled with splints that prevent them from bending their elbows. In heaven theyre still happy because they realize that if they feed one another they can eat well. In hell however they cant eat because they cant figure out how to work together. The woman discovers that the same challenges and opportunities exist in heaven as in hell. If you are kind and generous you will enjoy the afterlife. If you are greedy and unhelpful youll starve.         Amanda Hall illustrates the book in great boisterous color though the doodles in the margins feel busy. Gelfand has written the stories in language far more contemporary than that of With a Mighty Hand but to my ear it still seems unnecessarily formal with few contractions and pacing that gives it a cumbersome and uptight quality. (The book includes a CD recording of the actress Debra Messing reading the stories energetically. My two small children demanded to listen to it again and again.)         Gelfand takes certain liberties with these tales giving women more prominent roles than they conventionally have had a choice some might consider brazen. But what struck me most about Jewish Tales were the ancillary messages. In the story about the boy who couldnt read its really nice that those atoning Jews learned to be inclusive but did we have to watch a man publicly humiliate his young intellectually challenged son to grasp that? Its better to be generous than selfish but when I was a child the vision of an afterlife spent in arm splints  whether in heaven or in hell  would have haunted my dreams. In fact they still might. There have to be better ways to transmit these lessons.         The Torah and the traditional Jewish stories are problematic texts. When we hand them down to our children we hope they will extract what we ourselves value and set the rest aside until theyre old enough to grapple with it. But how can we predict what theyll take away from these books? Even when we provide a condensed version of the Torah we are taking a risk: With a Mighty Hand includes some of the books ugliest stories like Dinahs rape. But somehow its easier to shrug and say Well what are you going to do? since were taught that the Torah is the actual word of God. Perhaps we think it isnt appropriate for us to judge.         With the moralistic parables of The Barefoot Book of Jewish Tales which do not originate in the Torah its harder to understand why we should be passing them along without questioning whether we really believe their content is suitable for children. Because its always been that way isnt something we have to continue to settle for.

MARCUS,992,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/marc-browns-playtime-rhymes-and-more.html,28,As expectant parents in the mid-1940s a donnish English couple named Iona and Peter Opie became curious about the origins and back stories of the Mother Goose rhymes they recalled from childhood and would soon be reciting to their own newborn. When their Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes finally appeared in 1951 it caused a stir not only by validating childhood lore as a serious field of study but also by making the case for the rhymes as literature that generations had remembered less for their nonsense than for their nutshell artistry and usefulness in everyday life.         Alphabet rhymes counting rhymes frankly cautionary ditties like Jack and Jill  the pragmatic agenda of the Mother Goose canon ranges widely. Marc Browns Playtime Rhymes showcases yet another possibility: the traditional rhymes that come with a component of physical play that affords young children the chance to wiggle and unwind as they act out amusing easy-to-master mini-dramas like The Itsy Bitsy Spider Im a Little Teapot or the one whose rhyme starts: This little pig went to market. Long before psychologists roamed the earth tracking preschoolers fine-Â­motor development these charming games gave youngsters opportunities to hone and display their nimbleness and dexterity to engage in a tender form of cooperative play and to stretch their imaginations. Here is interactivity pure and simple with no batteries required and learning the games from this well-designed book is itself surprisingly easy.         To the left of each text line a small schematic drawing clearly indicates the corresponding finger hand arm or body movement or position. The larger color illustrations painted on textured wooden panels in sugary pastel colors expand on the playful narratives embedded in the rhymes in scenes set in the present day. Much of Browns art is relentlessly cheery with even the teapot short and stout assigned a slap-happy grin. But when the artist gets a tad more real about his characters as he does for The Wheels on the Bus with its witty rogues gallery of oddball passengers the scene comes alive: every face is worth a gander.         Jack Prelutsky  veteran rhymester troubadour and the Poetry Foundations first childrens poet laureate (2006-8)  has written 20 brief lullabies and cradle songs in the manner of another subset of the old-chestnut rhymes those whose purpose is to lull young children to sleep. Nearly all of Prelutskys poems are cast in the voice of a doting parent or other caregiver and addressed to a child including two poems (modern update!) spoken by a father and two by grandparents. Lilting rhythms and touching professions of love abound. But a poem must ultimately work its magic one word at a time and in several of these lyrics the author has it seems simply reached for the nearest word at hand. A cricket chirps stars twinkle the silver moon shines softly and a night wind softly sighs. Generic your-name-here language like this may sound poetic but it does little to unlock or illuminate the feelings of affection and intimacy that these poems aim to bolster and affirm.         In the best poems of this uneven collection Prelutsky shows us how the magic is done. Bird Lullaby is a jaunty mantra composed almost entirely from the names of birds: Robin jay sparrow chat chickadee wren / Mockingbird meadowlark hummingbird hen / Oriole bunting crow tanager thrush / Bobolink swallow are all in a hush. The second stanza is just as much fun to recite or memorize. And in the luminous title poem a lone beetle rowing an acorn boat / Across a silver lake offers a striking metaphor both for childhood vulnerability and the counterbalancing urge children feel to explore and test limits. Jui Ishida a versatile artist with a keen sense of design illustrates the poem with an elaborately choreographed nocturnal seascape in which the doughty bug paddles through reassuringly calm waters as a glowing firefly a friendly fish and the moon all watch over and out for the wee wayfarer.         Perhaps it is the old pre-Opie suspicion that tried-and-true nursery rhymes like Jack Be Nimble and Humpty Dumpty are just nonsense that prompted the publisher of David McPhails satisfying grab bag of more than five dozen such verses to name the volume: My Mother Goose: A Collection of Favorite Rhymes Songs and Concepts. This last item  which refers to a handful of pictorial spreads on such themes as Action Words and Getting Dressed  seems calculated to reassure wary book buyers that a modest investment in Mother Goose might indeed yield some tangible result. No need to worry. It would be hard to find a pithier or more palatable admonishment to look before leaping for example than the rhyme that goes: Three wise men of Gotham / They went to sea in a bowl / And if the bowl had been stronger / My song would be longer. Here too are mini-sketches of tricksters fools brave-hearts and other universal human types; lullabies and counting rhymes; and verses like Hey Diddle Diddle whose use lies in the brio and ease with which they prove that language is among the niftiest of all our toys.         The child characters in McPhails sprightly lyrical watercolors are wistful daydreamers who bear a certain family resemblance to those first seen in childrens book art in the path-finding early illustration work of Maurice Sendak for such picture books as Ruth Krausss A Hole Is to Dig; Else Holmelund Minariks Little Bear series; and The Moon Jumpers by Janice May Udry. McPhails youngsters are more apt to be rosy cheeked than Sendaks and also to look a bit more laid back as though freed from the arty obligation to double as an archetype. His animals in human dress look like people we might wish to know or perhaps even to be. Mother Goose rhymes are like that too surprising us with their fun-house view of the world and everyone in it not least of all ourselves.         Leonard S.

Scott Porter is a fifth grader living in a New York City suburb in 1962. One night his father shakes him awake saying Were being attacked.         Strasser has reimagined the Cuban missile crisis and set Fallout in a realistic John F. Kennedy America. Mickey Â­Mantle plays hero for the Yankees. Nikita Khrushchev plays villain for the Reds. Dads go to work and read Playboy. Moms keep house and smoke. The one unhistorical detail is that in this story the Soviets dont back down. They strike.         The narrative that follows alternates between present-tense scenes of acute distress as the Porter family and six largely unwanted guests struggle to stay sane and alive in an ill-stocked bomb shelter meant for four and past-tense scenes of the simple everyday dramas of Scott and his pals in the lead-up to the bombing. Nothing so theatrically terrible happens inside the shelter though there are some grisly arguments about reducing the number of hungry mouths. Yet as I read and suffered along with the characters I kept thinking how comparatively pleasant it would have been for them to have faced one of those zombie apocalypses screenwriters are so fond of these days. The bomb shelter is a form of living death. No electricity no privacy enough food for only a few days and persistent questions about whether the occupants will starve or suffocate or kill one another before radiation levels fall enough for them to escape the shelter. And what will they find when they open that trapdoor?         Theres down here and up there Scott says. The ones who feel like theyre buried are alive while the ones who arent buried probably arent alive. Personally Ill take zombies. At least with zombies you know where you stand (they want to eat you) and you can look up and see the sky in between attacks.         By now youre probably wondering whether Fallout is really appropriate for children. So lets be clear. For all its horror this is a superb entertainment suitable for any tough-minded kid over the age of 10. It thrums along with finely wrought atmosphere and gripping suspense. If the characters arent exactly overburdened with complexity theyre better drawn than many of the people one bumps into in the average thriller.         Strasser a prolific writer for children and teenagers writes with purpose and economy and structures his book intelligently: The scenes of prewar life give context and emotional weight to what happens in the shelter. Without the prewar material the tension and misery of the drama in the shelter might be unbearable.         My guess is that Strassers middle-grade readers know little about the Cuban missile crisis and this exercise in what if should help them  in a way no textbook could  to understand a historical moment better known for what didnt happen than for what did. By contrast the author knows his material very well. He was 12 in 1962 and his dad built a bomb shelter in the familys backyard. Given his experiences its no wonder Strasser takes a strongly antiwar position especially in an authors note at books end. Thankfully he had enough sense to leave most of the preachy tone out of his suspenseful narrative.

Certain details still stand out: saying goodbye to the old house through the back window of our Plymouth Duster; eating Charles Chips while waiting for the furniture to arrive; and of course the dread of falling asleep for the first time in my own room no longer an arms length away from my sister.         These memories came flooding back as I read Anna Was Here Jane Kurtzs timeless and sweetly funny middle-grade novel about the Nickel family  two sisters two parents and a cherished pet named Midnight H. Cat  who relocate from Colorado to Oakwood Kan. Our narrator is 9-year-old Anna Nickel consummate big sister and founding member of the Safety Club which prepares for potential disasters like wildfires floods and getting sealed inside Egyptian pyramids. Like many fourth graders Anna hates the thought of starting over again someplace else let alone smack dab in the middle of Tornado Alley. She scrawls a message in the closet of her old bedroom: Anna was here. And shell be back.         The question is how soon? Annas family has deep roots in Oakwood. Her father Micah now a minister grew up in the tiny town and is eager for Anna and her sister Isabella to get to know the family he left behind. Hes going back to help a troubled local church get over the hump which turns out to be more complicated than anyone imagined.         As soon as the Nickels arrive in their new town Micah becomes absorbed in the work of guiding his flock. Hes constantly on his phone and seems to spend more time changing the messages on the sign outside the church than he does with Anna who feels adrift among unfamiliar cousins. This modern thread in an otherwise old-fashioned tale reminds us that even ministers kids have to deal with parents who are Â­hyper-connected to their jobs.         The Kansas Nickels squire Anna and Isabella around the family farm and a local graveyard where their cousin Morgan tells them about their hardscrabble forebears. (Both girls are haunted by the tale of three sisters  Faith Hope and Charity  who froze to death in a blizzard on the way home from their one-room school.)         Yet even as Anna comes to appreciate her fathers people she craves the comfort of Colorado. Shes well versed in the language of faith but taking a leap is another matter  and adjusting to this move will require the biggest bravest one of her life so far.         As Annas mother a historian says Wouldnt it be handy if God sent important messages on a banner behind an airplane so everyone can read them? But then we wouldnt have the pleasure of watching Anna puzzle through her own catastrophic worries and conflicts of loyalty. If home is where the heart is will hers have to split time between two places?         In the vein of books like Sydney Taylors All-of-a-Kind Family series Kurtz delivers a gentle optimistic story about a devout family whose spirituality functions as both a safety net and an umbrella (a must-have in Kansas). The Nickels may navigate change  and even disaster  with a lot less friction than the average family (or at least mine) but theyre far from perfect. Thats precisely what will make Anna Was Here a moving-day classic destined to sidestep its boxed-up brethren for the important job of steadying someones shaky little hands.

This bit of information along with most everything she has to say about her father is delivered with the simpering brand of scorn reserved for teenagers discussing their parents. Amy an only child and in her final weeks at a girls school in London is a prickly misfit of the highest order  one part Holden Caulfield one part Lisbeth Salander. And shes got plenty to be mad about: Her mother who suffered from depression committed suicide two years earlier. Her father managing director of an investment bank has disappeared into his work installing a young and vacuous new wife in the family manse.          In what seems a deliberate attempt to firebomb her life Amy  a gifted violinist before her anger took over  swills liquor at nightclubs and gets her eyebrows nose lip and ears pierced with bolts. When that fails to get her expelled from school she blithely lights a cigarette in the middle of her last A-level exam.         Still all this barely registers with Amys distracted father who it turns out has been hit by his own bomb. His involvement in shady mortgage derivatives at the bank has cost him his job. He shows up at home to his Cartier-wearing replacement wife and metal-faced daughter the future suddenly unclear.         Whats a family to do?         If youre James Fields you buy a yacht a two-masted beauty called the Daisy May so luxurious that even tied up at a Southampton dock it appears to Amy like a Rolls-Royce parked at a broken-down factory. And with only three weeks of prep time you take off on a round-the-world trip meant to last between six and eight months. The idea behind the journey is vaguely cultural  a chance to see the sights  and vaguely an attempt at family bonding. What it is not is an Outward Bound-style exercise in self-sufficiency and personal development: Amys berth has a private bathroom and plasma screen TV. A crew of three has been hired to tend to the familys needs. For Amy its still nothing but a drag.         This is going to be good her father declares as they walk up the gangway to the yacht.         To which she replies Whatever.         Two months into the trip though a larger reckoning begins. The Daisy May gliding around the Horn of Africa is ambushed  taken over by armed Somali pirates who aptly size up the worth of their catch and demand a $10 million ransom.         Amy who until now has passed the days lounging around in a bikini plugged into her iPod so as to avoid meaningful conversation is designated Hostage Three. (Dad and Stepmom are hostages one and two respectively and the crew members are four five and six.) With a numb sort of disbelief she watches a group of khat-chewing AK-47-toting men ransack the boat helping themselves to the Westerners belongings. Suddenly there is a lanky pirate wearing Amys Superdry hoodie. Another ignoring the equatorial heat dons the parka her stepmother had bought to wear when the boat reached Patagonia.         Lakes first novel In Darkness which won a Michael L. Printz Award examined the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti through the eyes of a young victim. In Hostage Three he deftly paints the surreal and symbolic clash of worlds as Amys family and their Somali hijackers settle in for what becomes several weeks of ransom negotiations and maneuverings by the British Navy. The Daisy May is relocated so that it floats just off the Somali coast giving Amy a view of a land thats unimaginably foreign. There was an arc of sand with many small wooden boats lying on it toppled over looking strange and wrong out of water like toys discarded by a giant.         While the alien landscape glitters the familys experience itself is somewhat lightly sketched. Everyone remains reasonably well fed. The hostages who are allowed to roam the boat but spend the bulk of their time holed up in the yachts cinema room play games and watch movies. Even in the crucible of shared jeopardy Amys relationship with her father resists any bloom of real intimacy.

364,100000002527468,0,Article,Review,Books,books,review,In a Cold Country,BRAD LEITHAUSER,614,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/the-twistrose-key-by-tone-almhjell.html,25,The power of glaciers is waning were told in Tone Almhjells first novel a fanciful tale for children called The Twistrose Key. This suggests a story with worldly and timely concerns  the specter of climate change  but only three of the books 41 chapters take place in our world and time. The others are set around Sylveros an enchanted town nestled within the Palisade of Thorns. Outside the palisade Nightmares roam. Inside Petlings predominate. These are human-size upright-walking talking animals that were once the favorite pet of a human child. The Twistrose Key is a fantasy of the alternative-and-contiguous world sort in which events in our world may influence theirs and vice versa.         I suppose most fantasy fans cultivate their taste early in childhood with myths and fairy tales. And among such fans there must be some sizable subset who though charmed by the sunny exploits and high jinks of Greek and Roman mythology instinctively prefer the snowy often maddeningly incomplete annals of the Norse pantheon: Odin Loki Thor Freya. (Such was my own experience anyway.) Those readers who like their magical domains rimed with hoarfrost should find The Twistrose Key particularly congenial. Almhjell is Norwegian and her town of Sylveros has the inveigling twinkle of a Nordic settlement whose creature comforts  a cup of cocoa a crisp waffle some warm dry clothes  are enhanced by the surrounding rigors of an icy wind-blasted environment.         The books hero Lin Rosenquist is 11. When the story opens she has recently buried a favorite pet Rufus a red-back vole. (I suppose most readers will picture a mouse.) Through Rufuss beyond-the-grave connivance Lin is guided into Sylveros where much more awaits her than a reunion with a beloved vole who used to fit into her pocket but now is her size. Lin learns she is one in a line of enchanted children called Twistroses periodically summoned from our world to protect Sylveros from ruin. Rufuss boosted height and strength turn out to be indispensable since Lin soon comes under attack by a giant cat a giant parrot and some nasty trolls. Almhjell makes bustling Sylveros seem sufficiently beguiling  with its polycolored domes and tradesmens signposts its rabbit tailor its hamster baker  that its potential destruction creates genuine foreboding. The place partakes of that human/animal hybrid charm of the home interiors in The Wind in the Willows.         Elsewhere though The Twistrose Key feels overstuffed almost as though Almhjell had contemplated a multiÂ­volume series and then chose to cram all her inventions into a single book. There is an endless array of magical devices and word-coinages  Wandergates scargates Brain Tappers Thorndrips Frostfang and Sylver Fang snow globes and guard runes  some of which I had trouble envisioning or keeping track of. I kept thinking of Groucho Marx in Duck Soup: A 4-year-old child could understand this. . . . Run out and find me a 4-year-old child I cant make head or tail out of it. Lin makes an appealing stalwart heroine. I cared less than I would have liked about Rufus however whose character never emerged as anything beyond that of trusty servant.         The essential premise of The Twistrose Key  that a beloved pet can be reincarnated can be loved into a new existence  goes to the roots of myth and fairy tale. Its a theme always ripe for replenishment as Margery Williamss classic The Velveteen Rabbit shows. It goes in this case to the roots of written literature as well: In distant Norway a nebulous image of a singular snowy kingdom was gradually loved into existence emerging on our shores as the appealing solid handsomely illustrated Twistrose Key.         Brad Leithausers The Oldest Word for Dawn: New and Selected Poems was published earlier this year. He was inducted into Icelands Order of the Falcon for his writing about Nordic literature.
365,100000002527405,0,Article,Review,Books,books,review,Vanishing Acts,SUSAN CHOI,711,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/picture-me-gone-by-meg-rosoff.html,25,Mila and her father Gil are about to embark on a trip from London where they live to the United States where Milas fathers best friend Matthew lives. The trip has been planned for months but just as theyre ready to leave Matthews wife phones to tell them Matthew has vanished. Should they go on the trip anyway? They decide they will but now the trip is no longer a vacation but a missing-person investigation. So begins Meg Rosoffs Picture Me Gone a melancholy and ruminative book that is part travelogue part mystery and part coming-of-age for Mila. Mila is a rarefied sort of narrator familiar to certain parts of Rosoffs adopted London and to places like New York City if not many other locations. Mila is the only child of a Â­Swedish-Sudanese orchestra-musician mother and a father who translates Portuguese into English; they came to parenthood late never marrying.         Mila is cherished by these accomplished affectionate intelligent idiosyncratic parents for her own possession of these traits as well as a singular knack for empathy that sometimes verges on the psychic. With such parents Mila hardly needs friends but she does have one a live wire named Catlin whose own family situation presents a stark contrast to Milas. Its Catlins parents wretched and the cause of wretchedness who provide Mila with a foretaste of the fact that as a child one sometimes falls under the power of selfish and unhappy adults.         Rosoff has written five previous novels (the first How I Live Now won the Michael L. Printz Award) and picture books too including the very funny Meet Wild Boars. Picture Me Gone told in Milas voice is beautifully written full of keen observation. Marieka notices the world in what she calls a Scandinavian way which means without a lot of drama Mila says of her mother. The vanished mans house looks like a beautiful spaceship that just happened to land in a clearing. It shimmers in the black night. A lonely dog reunited at last with her master rubs the length of her body across his chest first one way then the other. If she could eat him she would. Such a voice is almost reward enough. Yet here the very strength of the voice begins to cast the weakness of the plot in sharp Â­relief.         Just as the object of Milas vacation with her father keeps changing so too does the object of the book. What begins as a mystery story soon turns into an unhurried travelogue as Mila and her father wander the highways of upstate New York sampling American traffic and American hospitality in slow-motion pursuit of a man who it turns out is not lost at all: the mystery isnt where to find Matthew but why no one wants to. Once Mila realizes this both she and we feel shortchanged. This indecisiveness of plot is mirrored by Rosoffs depiction of Milas empathy which sometimes resembles mind reading. Suzannes thoughts sound like a CD skipping.  Damn damn damn damn damn   and at other times X-ray vision as when she sees a waitress smoking on break and thinks: I wonder whether shed smoke if she knew she was pregnant. I guess shell find out soon enough. Yet elsewhere Mila maintains that there is nothing supernatural about her powers of observation that she is merely sensitive and indeed much of the plot relies on Milas being kept in the dark by the adults she most trusts. The result of all this premise-shifting is a book that can feel at times as oddly paced and directionless as Milas road trip with Gil. When that trip is over Suzanne Matthews estranged wife says to Mila Im sorry we made such a mess of your holiday . . . and everything else. Suzanne might be apologizing for these narrative shortcomings. Despite her intelligence compassion and courage and despite her beautifully wrought voice Mila is relegated a passive role in her own story; she spends the bulk of her time in the back of a car. This is a fine metaphor for her powerlessness at the hands of clueless and selfish adults. But this is also a story and in stories at least children have a better shot at triumphing or should.         Susan Choi is the author most recently of the novel My Education.
366,100000002527421,0,Article,Review,Books,books,review,Beauties and Beasts,MARIA TATAR,863,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/tales-from-the-brothers-grimm-and-more.html,24,With their violent excesses and winning magic fairy tales once entertained adults and children together. As John Updike said they were the television and pornography of an earlier age and they rarely pulled punches even when the young were listening in. Today fairy tales move on two different tracks: films like Snow White and the Huntsman and television series like Once Upon a Time add existential torment surreal plot twists and macabre special effects for their adolescent and adult audience while adaptations for children tame the tales original melodrama and impose moral lessons on their plotlines.         Lisbeth Zwergers Tales From the Brothers Grimm and Michael Hagues Read-to-Me Book of Fairy Tales draw children into nostalgic fairy-tale worlds with the seductive beauty of their illustrations. Fairy Tale Comics edited by Chris Duffy and animated by 17 cartoonists and illustrators by contrast refashions classic tales with bold creativity reminding us that as Italo Calvino put it a fairy tale is always more beautiful (and more interesting) when something is added. And then there is Princess Tales adapted by Grace Maccarone and illustrated by Gail de Marcken which enlivens the stories with rhymes seek-and-find pictures busy illustrations and unusual settings. This last volume takes a sentimental turn and is the safest choice for parents anxious about what Bruno Bettelheim endorsing the therapeutic value of the unforgiving violence in fairy tales called the uses of enchantment.         Some of the stories in Zwergers Tales From the Brothers Grimm reveal just how hard it is to cover up the primal energy of fairy tales. In one a young queen takes out a contract on her husband who despite many heroic feats remains nothing but a tailor. Hans My Hedgehog features a hero  half-boy half-hedgehog  who is so vexed with a young woman who refuses to marry him that he takes off her beautiful clothes and pricks her with his quills until she bleeds. Then he chases her back home where no one has a good word for her all the rest of her days. This is followed by The Children of Hamelin a version of The Pied Piper that bluntly declares: In all a hundred and thirty children had been lost. A poignant final illustration shows adults wandering the streets one holding the hand of a limp doll another pushing an empty carriage.         Though Zwergers watercolors are sometimes disturbing the decorative beauty of her work also functions as an antidote to the violent content of the tales. This dynamic is reversed in Hagues Read-to-Me Book of Fairy Tales: Allison Grace MacDonalds gentle prose mitigates the ferocity of some of Hagues illustrations. MacDonald uses an abundance of caution in retelling the tales making sure for example that Rumpelstiltskin does not tear himself in two as was the case in the Grimms version but simply stomps his foot in anger and disappears.         In adult reworkings of fairy tales almost anything goes and in a creative flash the girl in red can turn into Red Hot Riding Hood. When it comes to versions for children the urge to preach becomes almost irresistible. We put tight constraints on improvisation insisting on morals even when they do not square with the facts of the story. MacDonald turns the audacious Jack into a repentant rogue who knew he shouldnt have risked his life like that. Adventurous and beauty-loving Little Red Riding Hood is portrayed as disobedient (for talking to the wolf) and wayward (for picking flowers). In the end she promises never to stray from the path again just as her mother had told her in the beginning. All versions of Little Red Riding Hood in these collections make the same point even though staying on the path would not have changed a thing. In Fairy Tale Comics Little Red Riding Hood vows never to talk to strangers again an update to the story making it about stranger danger but ignoring the fact that conversation was never the real problem.         Not surprisingly Fairy Tale Comics is the most inventive and daring of the books remaking the old tales and infusing them with manic liveliness and antic art. By including less familiar stories like The Boy Who Drew Cats Give Me the Shudders and The Small-Tooth Dog the collection reminds us that such tales can be refashioned because they shape-shift with such ease never losing their edgy entertainment value even when we work hard to domesticate them for the younger crowd.         Once we orient fairy tales toward children we forget that they were engineered for entertainment less invested in sending messages than in producing shock effects so powerful that to this day we feel compelled to talk about them reinvent them and pass them on.         If you want intelligent children Einstein is said to have remarked read them fairy tales. He was surely less interested in simplistic morals than in how these stories use the sorcery of words to shock us into thinking about the terrible complicated things that can happen before happily ever after. That was the true educational value of the fairy tale. And he affirmed it by adding If you want them to be more intelligent read them more fairy tales.         Maria Tatar directs the Program in Folklore and Mythology at Harvard University.

Yes. Will it ever end? Dunno. Are we alone here in the stars? Dunno.         But hold on to that last thought. If you believe the newspaper headlines this is in fact one of those golden moments in history. Astronomers are on the verge of finding a world beyond our own solar system that might support life Earth 2.0 in the vernacular.         What we do when we find it is the trillion-dollar science-fiction question. Do we send an interstellar probe to visit? Can we dream of living there? Do we build giant orbiting telescopes that can inspect them for signs of life? Just the discovery of microbes on a distant planet would be like putting Copernicus and Darwin into the same bottle and giving it a good shake says Matt Mountain director of NASAs Space Telescope Science Institute.         But the stakes in the planet-hunting game are more than just intellectual as Lee Billings a freelance journalist points out in Five Billion Years of Solitude his graceful new book on the history meaning and personalities behind the search for life among the stars. Life on this planet has an expiration date he writes if for no other reason than that someday the Sun will cease to shine.         So we or our successors may need somewhere to go.         In the last 20 years the field of exoplanets  the planets outside our solar system  has become the fastest growing branch of astronomy. NASAs Kepler spacecraft alone has identified some 3500 potential planets in a small patch of the Milky Way and astronomers have concluded that there are roughly as many planets in the galaxy as stars that is to say billions. Some of them presumably must be like home. Happy hunting.         The field is hotly competitive and Goldilocks planets that might or might not be habitable  or even exist at all  have danced in and out of the news in recent years. Our putative twin remains missing.         Billings sketches this history ably though he is light on the exploits of Kepler which has driven the news of late. His main interest is less in chasing Goldilocks planets than in exploring the deeper issues involved including just how hard it will be to learn anything about these planets once we find them.         Earth for example is 4.6 billion years old but animal life has been around for only half a billion years and oxygen has only been abundant in the atmosphere for two billion years or so and of course intelligent life only a sliver of that time. If we found an analogue of Earth circa three billion years ago would we even recognize it as a promising place?         The books title Billings says is a reference to the expected longevity of life on Earth but his account is less about exoplanets than about the people who make the search for them their lives cause  creatures that before their sun went dim might somehow touch the stars.         We meet luminaries like Frank Drake a professor emeritus at the University of California Santa Cruz who pioneered the search for radio signals from extraterrestrials more than 50 years ago. Drake is now worried that Earths own detectability in this regard has declined with the advent of digital television a worrisome omen if this is the trend of advanced civilizations.         Reading this book is like peering over Billingss shoulder. He doesnt just interview astronomers and geophysicists; he and his subjects ponder the history of the universe over margaritas and one-dollar tacos. They tromp through redwood forests talking talking talking.         Sometimes they even do some science or at least try. During a trip to Lick Observatory in Northern California to watch Venus crossing the Sun the computer controlling one astronomers telescope goes berserk and he misses the crucial moment when sunlight shining past the edge of Venus can delineate the planets atmosphere a feat astronomers want to accomplish with exoplanets. Venus wont be transiting again until 2117.         Dennis Overbye a science correspondent for The Times is the author of Einstein in Love.

You may think its time to catch up with Jo Nesbo the Norwegian crime novelist everyones talking about and youre right. But  POLICE (Knopf $25.95)  is no place to start. This densely plotted story translated by Don Bartlett is one of Nesbos darkest and most disturbing the tale of a serial killer with a taste for the macabre who observes the anniversary of each of his murders by luring a police detective to a gruesome death at the scene of the very crime the officer failed to solve. The chills are palpable in this nerve-Â­racking thriller but key narrative elements and several characters are straight out of Nesbos previous novel Phantom which begs to be read first.          The authors most confounding plot device however is keeping the reader in the dark about the fate of his hero Harry Hole the maverick Oslo detective who took a bullet in Phantom and may be dead . . . or in a coma . . . or recovering in the arms of his beloved . . . or hovering in spirit above the heads of the select group of police officers who are conducting their own clandestine investigation into the cop killings. Removing Harry from the action is a bold move that pays off in incisive character studies of the ensemble players who have always languished in his shadow  secondary figures like Beate Lonn the brilliant head of forensics and Stale Aune the mild-mannered psychologist who misses the adrenaline rush of helping hunt down Harrys monstrous criminals.         Nesbo has always had a soft spot for his madmen and their grotesque methods of murder. Although he has yet to surpass the fiend he brought to life in The Snowman the child rapist and murderer who slithers through this story comes pretty close. Its more surprising to see the care this hard-boiled writer has taken with less flashy characters like Anton Mittet a humble policeman who has been assigned to guard a comatose hospital patient we assume to be Harry. Mittet grows in stature throughout the story but hes been a moody guy from the start. Looking around the brand-new hospital building he fantasizes about the future patients who would someday die there. It was already in the air he tells himself invisible bodies with restless souls had already been admitted.                  As historical mysteries go Victorian England has its charms; but dirty pestilential 18th-century France really promises a walk on the wild side. Jean-FranÃ§ois Parot delivers on that pledge with gusto in  THE CHÃTELET APPRENTICE (Gallic Books paper $15.95)  the first of 10 novels being translated by Michael Glencross and featuring Nicolas Le Floch a young police inspector whos a keen student of forensic science yet isnt above some down-and-dirty street fighting. This is an age after all when the police routinely apply torture during interrogations and depend on a host of informers spies and prostitutes to keep one step ahead of the criminals.         Nicolass first case an investigation into the disappearance of a high-ranking police official ushers this one-time country boy into the presence of Louis XV at Versailles. Being French Nicolas tends to brood on existential matters (The young man wondered about the enigma of the human character) while turning to philosophers like Pascal for guidance. But his is no high-society tale: he takes us into the dank cells of the Bastille the reeking morgue of the Basse-GeÃ´le the boisterous brothels and taverns and stewpots and all the other places we really want to see.                  Finding herself in a society governed by flux and reÂ­arrangement Precious Ramotswe the intrepid proprietor of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency in Botswana is determined to remain as steadfast as a constellation in the night sky. But Alexander McCall Smiths beloved sleuth comes to accept the inevitability of change in  THE MINOR ADJUSTMENT BEAUTY SALON (Pantheon $24.95)  when her trusted associate detective Grace Makutsi leaves the agency to have a baby. After being left to handle two cases on her own  verifying the identity of the heir to a farm and unmasking the person behind a hate campaign against the owner of a beauty salon  Mma Ramotswe realizes its time to make some momentous concessions even if her own philosophy on parenting goes no further than: Give babies lots of love and keep them warm and dont let flies settle on their noses.                  An English village as pretty as Nether Monkslip needs a romantic local legend  and perhaps a tasteful murder  to entice readers who love a cozy mystery. G. M. Malliet arranges for both in  PAGAN SPRING (Minotaur/Thomas Dunne $24.99)  which challenges the Rev. Max Tudor the resident sleuth in this charming series to identify a murderer among his parishioners and closest friends. Two cleverly designed set pieces a meeting of the Writers Square (the precious name chosen to avoid the clichÃ©d Writers Circle) and an elaborate dinner party are a droll introduction to the villagers. Malliet is a gentle satirist except when shes manhandling Thaddeus Bottle an egocentric playwright and actor who heads everyones list of potential murder candidates. Even Max gets a ribbing over his relationship with the woman who owns the New Age Goddesspell shop and practices an idiosyncratic brand of  wait for it  paganism.

Vernon N.Y. on Fiske Place directly above the train tracks. I used to sit in his windows and shoot rubber bands onto the tops of the cars of the southbound New Haven rattling by. It took some skill. Lawyers from that building liked to point thumbs at the disembarking passengers and say they couldnt wait to charge them whatever the traffic will bear  the first law joke I ever got after it was explained  but not Dad a Mt. Vernon boy who watched his town get blacker and poorer and allowed many clients to pay what they could afford.          He was a lawyer John Grisham would have admired. Grisham likes street lawyers forgotten lawyers almost lawyers tempted lawyers virtuous lawyers lawyers frustrated by their decency unhappy lawyers tapped-out lawyers shamed lawyers stumbling lawyers small-town and small-office and lost lawyers  them most of all. He would have frowned when my dad advised me to pursue the real money in corporate law although he would have understood. At the start of Sycamore Row Grishams 26th adult novel and one of his finest the attorney Jake Brigance needs money bad.         Sycamore Row is a true literary event  the sequel nearly a quarter-Â­century later to A Time to Kill Grishams first and perhaps best-Â­regarded novel. (It is taught in schools and has recently been turned into a Broadway show.) The sequel surprisingly doesnt take place in the present with Jake almost 60 and racially simmering Clanton Miss. inching closer to the inevitable year when minorities will be the majority in the United States. Instead this grand refreshing book is set in 1988 advancing Jakes story barely three years from the Carl Lee Hailey trial that was the centerpiece of A Time to Kill. At the end of that book Jake reluctantly conceded that he was not meant for the big time and groused about what a sap he was for taking just $900 to defend Hailey the black father who avenged the all-day rape and attempted drowning of his 10-year-old daughter  one of the most astonishing and visceral pieces of American writing ever set down  by assassinating the two human-mopwaters who perpetrated it. Jake still sees the rectitude in that defense and warms himself a bit excessively in the reverence of the local black community. But  a capital case for $900! The figure comes up a lot.         These days Jake spends maybe too much time setting traps to catch his secretary coming in late. And debating whether it might be smart to leave Clanton since some of the Klansmen who torched his house are starting to come up for parole. The Reagan/Bush F.B.I. isnt returning his calls. So Jakes carrying. Hes got a 9-Â­millimeter semiautomatic pistol in his briefcase another gun in his car more in his office. His marriage which might have dissolved has not. But he and his wife and daughter are living on top of one another in a tiny box because the genius 35-year-old trial attorney has been outmaneuvered by his insurance company. An air of frustration coats him. You cant entirely blame him for thinking hes Job in a red Saab he cant afford to upgrade.         The case that reclaims Jake is a contested will by a timberman and semi-loner named Seth Hubbard who writes it then hangs himself. Seth was clearly hated by his family. When they learn how much he was worth ($20 million give or take) they like him a lot more. Then they discover his new will lops them all out. Grisham has favored the lopping will in his plots before  in The Rainmaker his sixth book and The Testament his 10th. When the lawyers many lawyers gather to feed Jake has the honor of representing the new will; Seth chose him because he respected the Hailey defense. But when the other side offers to talk settlement integrity-first Jake isnt in such a rush because he wants to stretch his payday. Meanwhile with proponents of different will variations planning to leave their spouses once the loot is divvied the trial commences in Chancery Court and two problems keep palpitating. Testamentary capacity  how nuts was cancer-riddled Seth at the end? (Unable to resist a last tag Seth had inserted his fervent hope that his ex-wives perish in pain.) And undue influence. He leaves almost all his money to his attractive middle-aged black housekeeper Lettie who claims to be surprised. Others are less sure.         Charlie Rubin has written and produced for Law and Order: Criminal Intent and other shows. He teaches at the Tisch School of the Arts.

Madison the 1803 case establishing the power of judicial review Chief Justice John Marshall observed that the question of whether an act inconsistent with the Constitution could stand is a question deeply interesting to the United States but happily not of an intricacy proportioned to its interest. Two hundred and ten years later another eminent jurist has turned to questions whose intricacy matches  or exceeds  their interest. Reflections on Judging by Richard A. Posner a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is about what judges should do when confronted with complexity. Like the rest of us judges face an increasingly bewildering world marked by daily advances in such areas as social media the sciences and globalization. Unlike the rest of us judges must make decisions that enforce their understanding  or misunderstanding  of that complexity onto millions. In its organization this is a simple book. Posner recognizes that awesome charge: he decries one common response to complexity and endorses another.          At the outset Posner distinguishes between two kinds of complexity: external and internal. Law regulates external complexity but does not create it  think of sexting (in a First Amendment case) the science of the human genome (in a patent case) or the nature of the Nazarite vow (in a religious liberties case). In contrast law creates internal complexity  think of intricate rules of interpretation bloated conventions of citation or vague and poorly written opinions. While the judiciary cannot do much about the former kind of complexity it can  and in Posners view  must   address the latter.         Both forms of complexity of course have always existed. Yet Posner believes the rise of external complexity has triggered the rise of internal complexity. Judges he fears escape from complexity into complexity. Posner lambastes this move. Significantly he takes aim at formalism  the view that legal rules stand above and apart from politics  particularly as embodied in Reading Law a recent book by Justice Antonin Scalia and the legal lexicographer Bryan Garner. At face value one might think formalism would clarify rather than complicate given that it relies on rules that must be applied without regard to the judges personal views. Yet after noting that Scalia and Garner offer 57 varieties of interpretation many of which conflict Posner attacks their formalism as byzantine obfuscation.         More surprisingly Posner spends significant firepower assailing The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation. This compendium (The Chicago Manual of Style for lawyers) might seem an unworthy target. Yet he is excoriating not just the Bluebook but also the substitution of style over substance it represents. When created in 1926 supposedly by the great appellate judge Henry Friendly the manual was 26 pages. A recent edition spans 511 pages. Posner appears to believe that following the Bluebook is about as bad as rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic  and by reverse order of manufacture no less. He casts the Bluebook as a neurotic reaction to external complexity; if you cannot control what is important you make important what you can control. Posner notes that Friendly himself recommended that later editions be treated as the Greeks treated their unwanted progeny.         Posner attacks the formalism of judicial opinions with equal enthusiasm saying that opinions have grown needlessly complex. He decries judges who delegate opinion writing to their clerks assuming an editorial rather than an authorial role. This widespread practice he astutely argues increases the formalism of the opinions themselves given that the clerks will be more confident applying three-part tests on behalf of their bosses than drawing on their limited legal experience.         Posner also laments the use of jargon by both judges and clerks: Like other professionals judges dont want to be transparent to the laity. They want their calling to be a mystery and one way to make it so is to complexify what they do. To make his point he reproduces an entire opinion from an appellate court and then rewrites it cheerfully observing: The courts opinion is 3237 words long; my version is 602 words long.         In his introduction Posner states that judges rarely offer pointers to other judges and hopes this aspect of the book doesnt strike my judge readers as an impertinence. Yet his willingness to speak to his readers  judges or otherwise  as a jurist with three decades of experience is a strength of this book.         Kenji Yoshino is Chief Justice Earl Warren professor of constitutional law at New York University School of Law. His next book on the same-sex marriage litigation over Californias Proposition 8 will be published in 2014.

At the very least they would contemplate avoiding areas known for ambushes and land mines. But Marie Colvin one of the bravest and certainly best-dressed foreign correspondents of our time simply turned that injury which she sustained while reporting in Sri Lanka for The Sunday Times of London into a style statement. After an excruciating recovery involving flashbacks of the attack this extraordinary American reporter donned a black eye patch and returned to the field to risk her life over and over again. When she was killed by a rocket attack in Syria in February 2012 on yet another assignment colleagues were stunned although not exactly surprised. Colvin after all often arrived at the front lines first and stayed longer than others. She had been stranded on a 12000-foot mountain in Chechnya. She was nearly lynched in Egypt. She spent half her 56 years in the worlds most brutal conflict zones. Her luck couldnt last forever.         Two books one a collection of Colvins articles and the other an account of her last weeks pay homage to this formidable woman who tested the limits of an extreme profession. I worked in some of the same territory as Colvin as a foreign correspondent and never ceased to marvel at the lengths she took to chronicle violence and cruelty. She slept in caves wriggled through tunnels and trekked for miles in pursuit of stories. She went weeks without bathing slept soundly through bombardments and during the East Timor crisis of 1999 observed dryly as male colleagues evacuated: They dont make men like they used to.         Her stamina was fueled by jars of NesÂ­cafÃ© and the conviction that to draw attention to the worlds atrocities she had to keep pushing. On the Front Line showcases roughly 100 dispatches with a remarkable consistency in tone and purpose. Early in her career Colvin found her mÃ©tier: vignettes about ordinary people living under duress. Her voice was outraged yet clear and simple like that of her idol Martha Gellhorn and Colvins employers allowed her to cover whatever she wanted. She didnt do news conferences. Her focus was on noncombatants under grave threat: what was left of a family cowering in a shelter for instance.         Thanks to Colvins vivid writing the desperate scenes from Gaza to Yugoslavia in On the Front Line never grow repetitive. (On a gang member in Sierra Leone: It is hard to talk to Junior Savage. He has sewn the front half of a rats pelt to the baseball cap that is pulled down low over his forehead so the beady eyes of the dead rodent stare at you as a human voice talks from somewhere below.)         Colvin laced her tragic tales with wry wit too. One article depicts the existential quandary of an Iraqi double who after plastic surgery and a personality change to resemble a sadistic son of the despot Saddam Hussein struggled to reclaim his identity. Another recounts the bizarre attempts by the Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi to woo her one of which involved dispatching a nurse with a giant hypodermic needle to her hotel room on the grounds that the reporter looked tired.         While the collection celebrates lifetime achievement Under the Wire by the war photographer Paul Conroy tracks Colvins last assignments to Libya and Syria. Conroy worked alongside Colvin and although his phrasing is frequently clichÃ©-ridden the narrative becomes unrelentingly gripping as he depicts the pairs path toward disaster. My hands left sweat marks on the pages.         Surviving war reportage involves a mixture of luck and judgment. Normally the debate over how long to stay and when to leave is a collective process involving editors and those on the ground. For her Syrian finale intent on standing by the people of Homs Colvin rejected all counsel.         Their assignment begins with a muddy crawl through a claustrophobic tunnel toward the rebel-held Homs. Fellow reporters think Colvin and Conroy are nuts. Yet the two make it through and interview survivors who had been operated on by a veterinarian for lack of proper doctors. The reports shock the world. As Colvin decides they should press on Conroy follows her with a sick feeling. As a former British soldier he knows their mission is foolhardy but he goes along out of duty.

372,100000002527417,0,Article,Review,Books,books,review,Nation Builders,STEPHEN MIHM,1237,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/simon-winchesters-men-who-united-the-states.html,45,On July 4 2011 the British-born historian Simon Winchester took an oath to become an American citizen. It was a startling decision for someone Queen Elizabeth herself had made an officer of the Order of the British Empire not so long ago. Why the move? Winchester it seems was in love. But it wasnt a woman who captured his heart. No Winchester had fallen for an entire nation.         Winchesters self-described love affair with America began when he hitchhiked across the country as a footloose kid. When he finally got his passport he felt moved to write a history of the quality that most entranced him: Americas improbable at times incomprehensible unity. How was it he asked that people of such wildly different backgrounds share a near-mystical concord  how can such an eclectic assortment of peoples enjoy the same rights and aspirations encapsulated in their shared ability to declare so simply I am an American?         When people are smitten they are blind to flaws in their beloved. Winchester is no exception and this book is less a history than a love letter. In todays toxic political climate the idea that Americans are united may seem laughable. But this misses Winchesters bigger and otherwise valid point: The United States endures despite its conflicts. The country remains for all its diversity and differences of opinion united under a common government.         Why? Winchester acknowledges the adhesive nature of ideas but believes the ties that bind are most definitely in their essence practical and physical things. For Winchester land surveys maps canals railroads interstate highways and now the Internet are the strands of connective tissue that have allowed the country to achieve all it has and yet to keep itself together while doing so. Thats debatable but Winchester is sufficiently entertaining that its easy to forget the holes in his argument and enjoy the ride.         His tour mixes popular history with a contemporary travelogue. This frustrates attempts to tell the story as a conventional history as do the many eclectic stories he narrates. Winchester solves the problem by dividing his book into five sections that correspond to the five classical elements in the Chinese philosophical tradition known as the  wu hsing : wood earth water fire and metal. Each corresponds to a different unifying force: early land surveys (wood) geological surveys (earth) canals and waterways (water) and so forth.         Chinese cosmology aside much of what Winchester covers in these sections is familiar particularly in the early chapters. Thomas Jeffersons Land Ordinance of 1785  which effectively laid down a system by which unsettled territory might be surveyed settled and united with the rest of the country  gets prominent treatment as does Lewis and Clarks voyage of exploration. But other less famous figures make lengthy appearances like Thomas Hutchins the first Geographer of the United States who implemented Jeffersons vision. Winchesters eye for detail makes these vignettes a pleasure.         Thanks to these surveys Americans could visualize the countrys borders and boundaries; the next step was to map the details of the land itself. But maps were not in themselves sufficient. For an American in Maine to feel true kinship with a brother American in Arizona Winchester claims people and the things they made needed to be able to move with speed and ease from one corner of the nation to another. That meant canals and railroads promoted by memorable characters like John Stevens who devised and operated the nations first steam locomotive on a small circle of track in Hoboken N.J.         Winchester believes that while a modern transportation infrastructure was essential to forging an enduring union so too was the communications revolution that began with Samuel Morses telegraph. The moment instant communication was within the grasp of all he writes America was bonded and annealed into an almost unbreakable and indivisible one.         Perhaps but this ignores the fact that the telegraph  never mind the adoption of steamboats canals and railroads  coincided with the disintegration of the country over the issue of slavery. Improvements in infrastructure didnt prevent the outbreak of war; in fact they may have accelerated it. From the steamboats and trains that carried pro- and antislavery settlers to Bleeding Kansas to the telegraph lines that reported every angry exchange in Congress the nations infrastructure intensified the conflict. Moreover the very westward expansion Winchester celebrates was a catalyst for conflict as new territories applied for admission to the union threatening the balance between free and slave states.

373,100000002527392,0,Article,Review,Books,books,review,Gate Crashers,ANNALEE NEWITZ,1135,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/republic-of-outsiders-by-alissa-quart.html,48,With our civic sphere dominated by social media advertising and political pseudo-news its easy to despair that cultural subversion is a thing of the past. But in Alissa Quarts new book Republic of Outsiders we meet the often unlikely agitators who are participating in new social and cultural revolutions using the tools of what we would once have called the Man  technology entrepreneurialism and even finance. What emerges is a hopeful if sometimes uneven portrait of a mainstream culture thats constantly being rewritten by the people at its margins.         Quarts gift as a writer is her ability to report on the experiences of ordinary people following their realistically messy lives for years offering us vivid portraits that are profoundly humane. That said the people she chooses to profile here challenge the mainstream in such dramatically incommensurate ways that it can be difficult to detect a pattern linking them all. A few commonalities do emerge however. All of her outsiders have benefited from the rise of Internet technologies and theyve all found communities where they feel at home. Also given Quarts own predilections its not surprising that a lot of her subjects are writers.         The book begins with a fascinating chapter on patient advocates among people with schizophrenia bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses that many doctors treat with drugs. Instead of allowing medical experts to define them these people espouse mad pride and create communities where peer counseling replaces institutionalization. One subject has become an artist and another an activist devoted to helping people like himself lead autonomous lives.         Quart links the mad priders to the alt-health movement of the 1970s when patients insisted on being active participants in their own treatment. The same ethos can be seen today in online communities of the neurodiverse  for example people with autism or Aspergers  who provide support and information about new therapies.         Many of us are used to thinking about outsider status in the context of artistic or political subcultures and thats what makes Quarts reporting on what she calls outsider mentality such a brilliant move. She unmasks the assumptions we make about what counts as normal and marshals our sympathies for people who want to control their own destinies in a world that insists that they cant. Along the way she makes a persuasive case that medical and scientific institutions must change if were to move mainstream culture in the right direction.         The book falters when Quart chooses to place transgender feminists alongside mad priders and non-neurotypicals in her section on outsider mentality. By trying to compare such dramatically different kinds of outsiders she loses the ability to explain the dissimilar problems they face. Feminism is a political movement aimed at dismantling gender inequality and transgendered people are a minority group who often suffer from political discrimination. But Quart takes great pains to avoid politicizing the experiences of anyone she interviews.         Instead she uses business-speak. Of one of her trans subjects she writes Rey like other outsiders I met was a cultural entrepreneur of a sort selling an idea of transformation to a broader public as well as consuming it himself. Transgender feminism winds up sounding like a matter of clever marketing and we never learn about the forms of political discrimination that trans people like Rey face.         Quart may shy away from politics but shes not afraid to tackle economic outsiders. She devotes the final sections of the book to people she calls identity innovators. These are amateur musicians filmmakers chefs and crafters who are appropriating the tools of entrepreneurialism to reinvent themselves  and make some money in the process. We meet the crowdfunding diva Amanda Palmer who raised over $1 million on Kickstarter so she could make an album independent of the major labels. And we follow the exploits of a vegetarian crusader founder of the company Field Roast who fights for animal rights by making millions of dollars selling a meat substitute made from grain.

So when Morrissey the erstwhile leader of the post-punk legend the Smiths who once sang Theres more to life than books you know / But not much more published his Autobiography in Britain last month reaction couldnt be contained to one side of the Atlantic.         Billboard listed 10 revelations in the book. (8. He Turned Down a Cameo on Friends. ) New York magazines Vulture blog collected the 25 Most Morrissey-y lines from the book. (The clear winner to this reader: How delightful to be thought bad I muse as I sit by a reading-light pawing George Eliots Scenes of Clerical Life.)         The Internets incessant list-making was joined by more formal reviews. In The Times  Ben Ratliff called the book  as sharp as it is tedious both empathetic and pointlessly cruel. This led Sarah Weinman an editor for the industry newsletter Publishers Lunch to write on Twitter: So confused. NYT reviews Morrissey autobio export edition? Understood U.S. rights not sold yet still pending. Its true that at the time of Weinmans tweet Autobiography didnt have an American publisher but with the book just a click away from importation several others stateside have weighed in on its merits. On his New Yorker blog the music critic Sasha Frere-Jones called Morrisseys prose vertiginous impenetrable and idiosyncratic and genuinely strange. Writing for Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield gushed that the book was so much better than anyone could have imagined. . . . With charity toward none with malice for all Autobiography is petty bile raised to the level of madcap rapture.         The books brisk sales in Britain (nearly 35000 copies in its first week) and the intense interest in the United States suggest a sizable audience when its published here by G. P. Putnams Sons in December.          Quotable   There was nothing in those songs that I hadnt read about in books or seen in movies. Man With the Golden Arm had been out for years before I wrote Heroin. When people started yelling I thought Go take after Nelson Algren for Christs sake.   Lou Reed who died at 71 on Oct. 27 in a 1992 interview in The Los Angeles Times          No Kissy-Telly   Speaking of rock stars who can try our patience Courtney Love has a memoir on the way. According to Spin recent reports that the book would be published as soon as December were false but Love shared some early details about the project over the summer. Theres some salacious things about myself but theres certainly no kissy-telly Love told Billboard in July. I dont do kiss-tell.

375,100000002527425,0,Article,Review,Books,books,review,Legal Zelig,DAHLIA LITHWICK,1262,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/taking-the-stand-by-alan-dershowitz.html,12,On page 2 of his autobiography (and 30th book) Taking the Stand the lawyer activist writer legal academic and ubiquitous TV pundit Alan Dershowitz posits the following: There are in fact two Alan Dershowitzes. One is brash tough argumentative and uncompromising the character he plays on TV whom his son calls the Dersh character. The second is the real Alan who tends to shy away from confrontation and be something of a pushover. The real Alan is about friendship and jokes and walks on the beach. He is a family man. And as Dershowitz explains this book is an attempt to explore both sides of his personality.         The central problem with Taking the Stand then is that it was written by the Dersh character and it raises all the same hackles. Its argumentative and uncompromising celebrity-obsessed and self-promoting. Dershowitz likes to quote his own favorable press. He likes to talk about his centrality in the lives of others. (He seems to blame himself for the death of John Lennon). At its high-water mark the book might have been subtitled 6259 Things I Was Right About or alternatively Fancy People With Whom I Dine. Readers who tend to find the Dersh character maddening on television or in print will find much of the book maddening as well. Which is too bad. Because the real Alan has an amazing story to tell.         Born in 1938 to Orthodox Jewish parents in Brooklyn in a home with no secular culture Dershowitz seems to have been shaped in response to his early education  an authoritarian yeshiva where rote memorization was valued over rigorous thought or argument. A smartass and skeptic he was a C student throughout high school. Dershowitz did so poorly that he was almost barred from taking an exam for the Regents Scholarship. He developed a quick tongue a sense of humor and a gift for basketball to compensate. Much like his intellectual frenemy Antonin Scalia Dershowitz appears to have grown into his public self by the time he was 14.         Once at Yale Law School Dershowitz was racking up one success after another. Renowned professors were drawn to him: Guido Calabresi worked with him to improve his writing; Telford Taylor wanted to bring him to Jerusalem to work on the Adolf Eichmann trial (Dershowitz declined). A clerkship for Judge David Bazelon on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia led to a clerkship for Justice Arthur Goldberg at the Supreme Court where Dershowitz drafted a memorandum in support of ending the death penalty in America. He became the youngest assistant professor in the history of Harvard Law School at age 26. But even so he needed more: I wanted to make legal history rather than just write about others who did. He began to take on cases; the transition to the Dersh character was complete.         Dershowitz is at his best in his terse elegantly argued chapters on doctrine especially free speech criminal law human rights law and the death penalty. These are short master classes in how to teach law to ordinary Americans. For instance he lays out his First Amendment philosophy  free speech always and for everyone  in a few pages rooting it in the principle that speech that challenges authority is vital. Thats why he defended the male star of Deep Throat and neo-Nazis who wanted to march in Skokie Ill.; and voiced his support for the Holocaust denier Matthew Hale and a professor who implicitly endorsed the possibility of alien abduction. When he defends those whose beliefs he deplores Dershowitz either donates his fees to groups like the Anti-Defamation League and N.A.A.C.P. (as he attempted to do with Hale) or challenges them to public debates on their views (as he did with Vanessa Redgrave). His career has been a natural experiment in the proposition that the cure for toxic speech is invariably more speech and while there is nobody he will not debate browbeat or wrestle into submission there are a few speakers he refuses to support like the Muslim student protestors who interrupted a talk by Israels ambassador to the United States.

Yet over the course of the book Violets certainty about her identity  and nearly everything else  will be turned upside down.         An American child (or so she thinks) Violet lives in Shanghai in 1905 in an establishment called Hidden Jade Path a first-class courtesan house that caters to both Westerners and Chinese. It is run by her cool aloof and seductive mother who goes by several names among them Lulu Mimi. A lonely difficult child  one of Tans signature prickly heroines  Violet takes solace in playing with her ferocious pet cat and in spying on the courtesans lovemaking. She yearns for her mothers affection  and for any clue about the identity of her father.         Seven years later in 1912 the year of the dowager empresss abdication and the founding of the Chinese republic a suave man called Lu Shing comes to visit. Eavesdropping Violet is amazed to hear her mother expressing feelings she never thought Lulu had. With a shock of horror Violet realizes that Lu Shing is her father  which means she is half Chinese caught between two very different societies and fitting into neither. Worse she has an unknown brother back in California a boy her mother seems to love far more than she loves Violet. Desperate to see him Lulu sails for San Francisco. In an unexpected plot twist Violet is left behind.         This is just the beginning of a long and ultimately heart-wrenching narrative that covers more than four decades and moves from Shanghai in the 1920s and 30s to the Hudson River Valley to a mountain village in rural China with an interlude of backtracking in late-19th-century San Francisco. The epic history of these times is woven into the complex background of the story of three generations of women its events seen as they would have seen them. Their private lives and private pain take center stage.         Sold to a courtesan house by a loathsome yet charming friend of her mothers Violet is reunited with one of the women she knew at Hidden Jade Path a kind soul called Magic Gourd who teaches her young charge how to survive the tough courtesan world  what songs to sing what stories to tell and how to tell them when to give a coquettish sideways glance how to identify the best clients and manipulate them into giving expensive gifts. But when Violet meets a man named Loyalty Fang all these instructions fly out the window. Violet refuses to acknowledge that like all Chinese men he will marry the woman his family chooses. For him and her other suitors she will always be just a singing sparrow in a cage.         Reluctantly Violet learns to treat her life as the other courtesans do as a job. Many customers later an earnest American named Edward Ivory offers solace companionship and the careful mending of wounds. Ivory also has a wife  in his case safely back in America  so Violet moves in with him and they have a child a daughter called Flora. But the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 and the appearance of the real Mrs. Ivory threaten Violets new life.         Although the narrative becomes progressively darker Magic Gourd is always there to inject a note of humor. But when she and Violet attempt to escape the increasing instability and danger of Shanghai and make the grueling journey to Moon Pond Village the supposedly peaceful ancestral home of a Chinese poet even she finds it difficult to cope with their dismal prospects.         Its only at this point that Tan begins to share Violets mothers story turning the clock back to 1897 San Francisco. Far from the cold and calculating figure Violet knew as Lulu Lucia Minturn is revealed as an adventurous young woman who defies her family and sails to Shanghai in the vain hope of marrying her Chinese lover: I had let infatuation guide me . . . toward a golden vale that did not exist toward a city at the other end of the sea. Gradually the puzzle pieces of the plot fall into place.         That golden vale that did not exist is depicted in The Valley of Amazement the enigmatic painting that gives the novel its title. Its everywhere and everything  the view from the mansion where Violets American lover lived as a boy Violets first sight of Moon Pond Village even an expression of her mothers immortal spirit. Each person finds a different message in this landscape. Was the painting meant to depict a feeling of hope or was it hopelessness? Violet wonders when she first sees it. The painting reminded me of those illusions that changed as you turned them upside down or sideways.         Written in Tans characteristically economical and matter-of-fact style The Valley of Amazement is filled with memorably idiosyncratic characters. And its array of colorful multilayered stories is given further depth by Tans affecting depictions of mothers and daughters. Here are strong women struggling to survive all that life has to throw at them created by a writer skilled at evoking the roil of emotions and mad exploits they experience when they follow their hearts.         Lesley Downer is a British writer of Chinese and Canadian descent. Her most recent book is a novel The Samurais Daughter.
377,100000002527382,0,Article,Review,Books,books,review,Fields of Endeavor,JONATHAN MAHLER,935,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/the-beginning-of-everything-and-living-with-jackie-chan.html,32,For teenage boys sports can be a kind of emotional centerboard helping to keep them from capsizing during the turbulence of adolescence. Or they can be an anchor holding them too close to a familiar shore preventing them from venturing into unknown waters from finding out who they really are.         In these two young adult novels we see both sides. Ezra Faulkner the blue-eyed cleft-chinned wisecracking protagonist of The Beginning of Everything was the captain of his high school tennis team before he totaled his BMW and was left barely able to walk. His sports career is over and with it the easy identity of the jock.         Eastwood High used to be mine the one place where everyone knew who I was and it felt as though I could do no wrong Ezra reflects alone on the schools tennis courts with his recently acquired cane the night before the start of his senior year. His new life begins the next day as he hobbles into the school gym for the welcome-back pep rally for the first time taking a seat in the bleachers instead of streaming onto the basketball court with the rest of the varsity athletes. Josh the brooding hero of Living With Jackie Chan is dragged into sports  specifically karate  by the slightly annoying uncle hes living with for the year. Josh is nursing the wounds of his own crisis (the events in Knowless 2009 novel Jumping Off Swings): He impregnated a girl hed hooked up with at a party who had the baby and gave it up for adoption. Progressing through his belts at the local Y.M.C.A. Josh unexpectedly discovers an inner peace in his rhythmic katas and learns that his uncles cheesy talk about what it means to be a true karate man  one with a godlike capacity to think and feel for others irrespective of their rank or position  has a particular relevance to his situation.         On the surface these are very similar books. At the center of each is a vulnerable high school senior struggling to move forward after a life-changing event a single encounter after which everything that really matters will happen as Ezra puts it. They know they will never be the same; theyre just not sure who they will be. Both meet unlikely love interests who help them see themselves with fresh eyes. In Ezras case its Cassidy the smart ironic unconventionally pretty new girl who dresses as if shes just stepped out of an old-fashioned movie. In Joshs its his uncles upstairs neighbor and karate partner Stella.         Tonally though the books are very different. Set in the suburban Eden of Southern California The Beginning of Everything is all bright colors and rich detail from Ezras gated community of six-bedroom Spanish-style homes to the fireworks exploding over Disneyland when he finally kisses Cassidy on the roof of his car.         The architecture and archetypes of The Beginning of Everything are a little too familiar right down to the lunch tables that separate Eastwood Highs popular kids from Ezras new crew misfits who have their own private film club are on the debate team and participate in flash mobs. Fortunately Robyn Schneider can write. The flash mob scene is vividly rendered with Ezra moving awkwardly to a song by the Clash then at Cassidys urging taking off his headphones to watch hundreds of strangers dancing in utter silence. Its an endearing book filled with similarly touching little moments and plenty of snappy dialogue that may not be quite credible  Cassidy drops in casual references to Shakespeare and Foucault  but makes for entertaining reading anyway.         Living With Jackie Chan is darker and more spare a little less absorbing but ultimately just as affecting. In the aftermath of his own life-changing encounter Josh leaves everything behind  not just his parents and friends but all of his photographs of them. All I really know is that I need to get away and this is the only chance I have he says to himself shortly after arriving at his uncles.         In his emotionally broken state Josh remains a loner. When hes not at the Y hes usually in the library or in the guest room of his uncles apartment punching a Â­Jackie Chan poster after being awakened by the baby upstairs  a persistent reminder of the part of his past that he most wants to leave behind but of course cannot.         The whole karate man motif is heavy-handed almost to the point of parody. (Its hard to read the phrase and not think of Eddie Murphy in Trading Places: Karate man bruise on the inside!) But theres something undeniably powerful about the stripped-down world that Jo Knowles has created and the shut-down state in which Josh moves through it unable to process what he has done and the shame it has made him feel let alone talk to his nerdy uncle about it.         What do our heroes learn from their crises? In a sense opposite lessons. Josh realizes that he cant run from who he is that he has to find a way to take responsibility for his actions. Ezra discovers that he can start over or maybe that hed been sitting at the wrong table his whole life. Oscar Wilde once said that to live is the rarest thing in the world because most people just exist and thats all he reflects at the end of The Beginning of Everything. I dont know if hes right but I do know that I spent a long time existing and now I intend to live.         Jonathan Mahler is a columnist for Bloomberg View and a contributing writer at The New York Times Magazine.
378,100000002527407,0,Article,Review,Books,books,review,Overt and Covert,ADAM LeBOR,1259,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/the-brothers-by-stephen-kinzer.html,50,Anyone wanting to know why the United States is hated across much of the world need look no farther than this book. The Brothers is a riveting chronicle of government-sanctioned murder casual elimination of inconvenient regimes relentless prioritization of American corporate interests and cynical arrogance on the part of two men who were once among the most powerful in the world.         John Foster Dulles and his brother Allen were scions of the American establishment. Their grandfather John Watson Foster served as secretary of state as had their uncle Robert Lansing. Both brothers were lawyers partners in the immensely powerful firm of Sullivan & Cromwell whose New York offices were for decades an important link between big business and American policy making.         John Foster Dulles served as secretary of state from 1953 to 1959; his brother ran the C.I.A. from 1953 to 1961. But their influence was felt long before these official appointments. In his detailed well-Â­constructed and highly readable book Stephen Kinzer formerly a foreign correspondent for The New York Times and now a columnist for The Guardian shows how the brothers drove Americas interventionist foreign policy.         Kinzer highlights John Foster Dulless central role in channeling funds from the United States to Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Indeed his friendship with Hjalmar Schacht the Reichsbank president and Hitlers minister of economics was crucial to the rebuilding of the German economy. Sullivan & Cromwell floated bonds for Krupp A. G. the arms manufacturer and also worked for I. G. Farben the chemicals conglomerate that later manufactured Zyklon B the gas used to murder millions of Jews. Of course the Dulles brothers law firm was hardly alone in its eagerness to do business with the Nazis  many on Wall Street and numerous American corporations including Standard Oil and General Electric had interests in Berlin. And Allen Dulles at least had qualms about operating in Nazi Germany pushing through the closure of the Sullivan & Cromwell office there in 1935 a move his brother opposed.         Allen Dulles spent much of World War II working for the Office of Strategic Services running the American intelligence operation out of the United States Embassy in Bern Switzerland. His shadowy networks extended across Europe and his assets included his old friend Thomas McKittrick the American president of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel a key point in the transnational money network that helped keep Germany in business during the war.         The O.S.S. was dissolved in 1945 by President Truman but was soon reborn as the C.I.A. Kinzer notes that Truman did not support plots against foreign leaders but his successor Dwight Eisenhower had no such scruples. By 1953 with Allen Dulles running the C.I.A. and his brother in charge of the State Department the interventionists dreams could come to fruition. Kinzer lists what he calls the six monsters that the Dulles brothers believed had to be brought down: Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam Sukarno in Indonesia Patrice Lumumba in the Congo and Fidel Castro in Cuba. Only two of these Ho Chi Minh and Castro were hard-core Communists. The rest were nationalist leaders seeking independence for their countries and a measure of control over their natural resources.         Ironically Ho Chi Minh and Castro strengthened perhaps by their Marxist faith proved the most resilient. But the world still lives with the consequences of bringing down Mossadegh who might have guided Iran and thus world history along a very different path. The 1953 C.I.A.-sponsored coup that brought Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi to power was seared into Irans national consciousness fueling a reservoir of fury that was released with the Islamic revolution of 1979.         The Iranian section of Kinzers book is especially strong. Here he calls attention to the cancellation by the Iranian Parliament of a contract for what was said to be the largest overseas development project in modern history with Overseas Consultants Inc. an American engineering conglomerate. But it seems likely that it was the Iranian Parliaments vote to nationalize the oil industry that sealed Mossadeghs fate. (Allen Dulles represented the J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation one of whose clients was the Anglo-Â­Iranian Oil Company.)         Adam LeBors latest nonfiction book is Tower of Basel: The Shadowy History of the Secret Bank That Runs the World.
379,100000002540537,0,Article,News,Fashion & Style,fashion,weddings,Wedding Q. and A.,PEGGY POST,755,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/fashion/weddings/wedding-q-and-a.html,, Cold Feet? Fork Over the Loot     Here is the scenario: man with family on the East Coast is marrying a woman whose family lives on the West Coast. They decide to have two luncheons one here in the East for family and friends of the man followed by another luncheon in the West for the family and friends of the woman. The couple set up their wedding website so that the invited guests could give wedding gifts through PayPal which we did generously before attending the luncheon. A few months later the couple broke up. No wedding. No West Coast luncheon. No mention of what they did with money received as wedding gifts.    While I feel badly for this couple I think they have an obligation to return this money. What is your opinion?    Anonymous   When a wedding is canceled it is expected that the couple send back all wedding gifts they received cash or otherwise. The gift is in honor of the marriage. When the marriage doesnt take place returning the gift is the right thing to do. In addition it is thoughtful to enclose a brief note with each returned present thanking the giver (a second time if a thank-you note was already sent) and mentioning the reason for the return. If this task is too painful for the former couple then parents siblings or members of the wedding party can take it on.         It can only be hoped that a parent or friend will remind this couple of their obligation.          No Fancy Scribbling Required         I know that it is traditional to have a calligrapher handwrite the addresses for the wedding invitations. Since my fiancÃ© and I are on a budget and he works in a print shop we found it to be more economical to have the addresses printed with the invitations since neither one of us have especially neat handwriting and couldnt afford a professional.     The problem is that we thought the printer would use the same script font for the addresses that they used for the invitations but instead used a print font. To have new envelopes printed would cost extra money and it seems silly to spend more money on something as minor as print on an envelope.     Are we committing some horrible sin by sending out the printed envelopes?     Anonymous   While calligraphy looks pretty it is in no way a requirement. Many couples address invitations in their own handwriting or they round up some friends and relatives who have good penmanship to help with the addresses. Why the handwritten addresses? A wedding invitation is considered the most personal of all social invitations; a handwritten envelope is a tangible expression of that concept.         These days with advances in printing and the wide availability of fonts that mimic engraving or calligraphy printed envelopes can be just as impressive as hand-addressed ones. While they may not entirely convey the personal touch they are as you have discovered a very practical alternative especially for couples on a budget. Printed self-stick address labels however are too impersonal and reminiscent of mass mailings to be used for wedding invitations.         While it is unfortunate that your printer used a standard font instead of one that matched your invitation spending extra money to reprint the envelopes does not make sense. As long as you think the printed font that has already been used is attractive and clearly legible (you dont want your wedding invitations to look like third-class unwanted mail) your envelopes are fine just as they are.          No Fancy Duds Required     The son of a very good friend is getting married in November. Because of financial constraints the bride and groom have invited a small group to the wedding and dinner afterward with the balance of guests invited to attend the reception only  the group I fall into. The couple has stated black tie preferred on the invitation but we are wondering if cocktail attire would be acceptable by most standards since we are not going to the wedding only the reception. We dont wish to be disrespectful but would rather not spring for black tie since thats not a normal part of our wardrobe and perhaps put the funds toward their gift.  Any guidance?     Anonymous   When the word preferred accompanies black tie the hosts are really saying that black tie (meaning a tuxedo for men) is optional. It would be O.K. for the men to wear either dark suits or tuxedos and for you and the other women guests to wear cocktail attire.                Also in T Magazine »

His friend in white shift and straw hat greets the ingÃ©nue as he gets off the boat: Come on lets go to the supermarket and get a chicken.         A gay black man Als portrays gay black mens longing to cherish what they cannot sexually love the putative opposite of themselves yet the emblem with which they deeply identify: white girls. Als admires and loathes white girls mocks and mimics white girls is ignored by white girls is depended on by white girls is perceived to be a white girl. White girls he shows is not just literal people. Its a state of mind an art of being.         Witness in one essay the black drag queen wearing jeans a halter top and an upswept hairdo who plunks herself on the lap of an older white gentleman and announces: Thats what I want you to make me feel like baby a white woman. A white woman whos getting out of your Mercedes-Benz and going into Gucci to buy me some new drawers because you wrecked them. Just fabulous.         Als owns up to the sadomasochistic nature of white-girl worship. Watching Gone With the Wind for the first time he fell in love with Vivien Leigh who as Scarlett suffers and says she will never suffer again and I loved her so much I didnt want her to suffer. He adds I would have made her forget that I was colored and that she could lynch me if she wanted to because I knew I could make her love me.         A staff writer for The New Yorker Als knits together profiles of white girls across history from Louise Brooks to Michael Jackson. Truman Capote became a white girl in 1947 when the dust-jacket photograph for Other Voices Other Rooms was taken. Lounging on a divan he devours the camera with his eyes. By asserting himself as the most famous woman author  not writer an important distinction  of his generation Als writes Capote temporarily thwarted certain women from achieving equally deserved success.         Capotes come-hither publicity still isnt all that made him a white girl. In the 1950s Norman Mailer called him as tart as a grand aunt and Capote shamelessly appropriated the voices  the syntax the style  of well-known women also generally perceived as maiden aunts (Eudora Welty Carson McCullers). But the publication of In Cold Blood marked his reversion to manhood. A big book in the male nonfiction tradition it transformed Capote from a lyrical authoress into a serious author-adventurer validated by his experience in the world of fact.         Alss careful read on Capote doubles as a mind-popping take on white girls generally. He exposes the funny and calculated fissures that can open between the white-girl self were shown and the white-girl self we cannot know the slipperiness of white girls as shackled objects of desire and matrices of power. Nearly all his other literary readings glisten with this panache.

Just like America. Trains typically get in trouble when theyre not moving forward. Just like America. Theyre romantic too  again just like America or at least the idea of America. So its no wonder that trains whether as symbols of might or restlessness have played such an iconic role in our popular culture from the folk tale John Henry to such songs as Mystery Train and 500 Miles to films as varied as The General North by Northwest and Before Sunrise. But who loves trains more than kids? Youd think there would be a surfeit of whistle-blowing wheels-aturning classics in the picture-book section shelves and shelves of them right up there with bunny books and princesses. Trains are so wonderfully graphic too slashing across landscapes and barreling full speed ahead to force dramatic perspectives  after all what is a train but a line on steroids? Funny though I can think of only a couple of genuine picture-book classics starring locomotives: The Little Engine That Could and The Polar Express  and maybe I should also include Green Eggs and Ham because as a rule one should always include Green Eggs and Ham. (I will not eat them in the rain. I will not eat them on a train.)         Oh right Im forgetting Thomas the Tank Engine the multimedia phenomenon. Or rather as the father of a son who once had 40 miles of Thomas track Im blocking his dutiful memory. Leave it to the English to neuter trains and turn them into civil servants with wheels. Happily we have three new American train books to consider here. Im not sure any are future classics but all are first-rate; and one Locomotive by Brian Floca is the very deserving winner of a 2013 New York Times Best Illustrated Books Award.         Locomotive tells the story of a familys 1869 journey across America on the newly completed transcontinental railroad. A mother and two children serve as our surrogates on this trip but they are essentially extras in a book whose star is the train itself from steam engine to caboose along with everyone and everything that keeps it thundering down the track toward Californ-eye-ay. Floca whose previous books include Moonshot and Lightship seems intent on doing for modes of transport what David Macaulay has done for cathedrals castles and pyramids. Locomotive incorporates many dollops of technical detail about 19th-century railroading but while flirting at times with book-report dryness Floca mostly keeps things vivid. Mordant humor helps: Heres what they say about switchmen: / You can tell that one is new to the job / if he still has all his fingers.         Locomotive is unusual for a picture book in that it is intended to please a fairly wide age group which means it may also frustrate some readers or listeners. Older children will appreciate the wealth of detail and history while younger ones will be entranced by the appropriately chugga-chugga rhythm of Flocas free verse and his abundant use of sound effects (playfully emphasized with well-muscled 19th-century-style typefaces): Now comes the locomotive! / The iron horse the great machine! / Fifty feet and forty tons. . . . / Hear the clear hard call of her bell: / clang-clang! clang-clang! clang-clang! / Hear the hisssssssss and the spit of the steam! / Hear the engine breathe like a beast: / huff huff huff!         Of course the risk is that younger readers might get bored by say the digression on braking protocol while older children will find the clang-clang business babyish. But everyone  parents too  will be thrilled to learn how a train toilet worked in 1869. (It sat atop a simple hole; not polite to use while in a station.) Everyone will be even more thrilled by Flocas illustrations. Hes a brilliant exacting draftsman; he also knows how to give his pictures a cinematic energy especially in the way he cuts from page to page. A spread showing the train crossing a rickety wooden bridge uses a funny visual trick to jolt your eyeballs along with the passengers. Flipping through this book made me smile with pleasure before I even read it.         Elisha Coopers Train updates Locomotive by taking a contemporary more impressionistic cross-country journey one that begins in a New York City for which Cooper has imagined a far more graceful point of embarkation than the miserable smelly dungeon that is our real-life Penn Station. (Memo to self: idea for Gothic romance set in the haunted bowels of Penn Station  The Hunchback of New Jersey Transit?) Coopers trip starts with a commuter train segues to a passenger train then a freight train and so on until we find ourselves on a futuristic bullet train whizzing optimistically into a fanciful San Francisco terminus that looks as if it were designed by Eero Saarinen. Coopers prose is more restrained than Flocas but just as vivid and often singing with poetic specificity. I love this passage: As the train approaches a rail crossing it sounds like a storm. As the train passes it sounds like dropped pots and pans. As the train leaves it sounds like the  da dum da dum  of a beating heart. Then silence. Coopers illustrations have a similar feel detailed yet impressionistic  no mean feat.         I saved my favorite for last. How to Train a Train is exactly that: a guidebook that teaches children how to capture and tame wild trains. First get up really early in the morning and find a good hiding spot close to some trains. . . . As the sun rises the trains will begin to stir and start their engines. Watch them work and play. Its only natural that youll want to take home all the trains but dont just grab the first one you see. Take your time and choose one thats  right  for  you . Got one? Time to make your move. As you can tell Jason Carter Eatons deadpan prose is calibrated just-so. He wisely leaves the abundant belly laughs to John Roccos paintings which have their own zany style but also owe something to the absurdist scales and perspectives of the great Bruce McCall. Alarmed parents will be relieved to learn that trains make terrific pets capable of learning tricks and amenable to baths so next time the kids are begging maybe skip the hamsters and go diesel. How to Train a Train doesnt deal with the ultimate pet-related question  mortality  but my advice is to parry any anxious queries with the old fib about sending it to a nice roundhouse upstate.

383,100000002536127,0,Article,News,Theater,theater,,Playing the ‘Crazy Women’,ALEXIS SOLOSKI,1049,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/theater/playing-the-crazy-women.html,12,Anne-Marie Duff often bares her soul onstage. Occasionally her underwear too. At a wardrobe fitting for  Lincoln Center Theater s  Macbeth  in which she plays  Shakespeare s fiendlike queen she pointed to a transparent slip that is part of her costume and talked about the knickers she wanted to wear underneath. The Scotland flag she said brightly. Or plaid. Tartan.         An English actress of Irish extraction Ms. Duff will make her New York debut in a role she had thought she would never attempt. Her husband  James McAvoy  played Macbeth   in London this year  and though Ms. Duff had been offered the part of his Lady Macbeth she declined it. Ever since she and Mr. McAvoy met (while filming a vigorous sex scene for the original British version of the television series  Shameless ) the press has fawned over the couple who rarely discuss their marriage (they wed in 2006) and seldom appear at events together. Ms. Duff feared that the tabloid attention her casting would attractÂ might derail the production.         Thats all anyone would have spoken about she said back in her dressing room hair tugged into a messy knot legs tucked girlishly beneath her.Â So I thought: I wont be able to do this play. Ill just have to say goodbye to it.Â          Then the director Jack OBrien who had been impressed by Ms. Duffs starring turn in George Bernard Shaws  Saint Joan  called with an offer for the Lincoln Center production which is now in previews for a Nov. 21 opening. Ms. Duff leapt at it. It was the most unbelievable blessing really she said. Within the world of classical theater there arent that many extraordinary characters. There are lots of ingÃ©nues lots of aged queens but there arent that many extraordinary female characters.         What extraordinary female characters there are chances are Ms. Duff has played them. In addition to Joan of ArcÂ she has appeared as Ibsens Nora Racines Berenice and Shakespeares Cordelia. Simon GodwinÂ who directed her this summer as Nina in Eugene ONeillsÂ  Strange Interlude Â a grueling role in which her character ages 25 years describes Ms. Duffs specialty as impossible parts.         Asked to find a common thread among her varied roles she said that she gravitates toward characters at some tipping point in their life where things can either go terribly wrong or not  some  Hurricane Sandy  about to come sweeping through. When such roles crop up she said directors come calling.         But were you to watch her films (like  The Magdalene Sisters  and  Nowhere Boy ) or scan stills from her stage roles you might not realize you were staring at the same actress despite her distinct features  her funny old face as she calls it. Bedroom eyes an assertive nose and a generous mouth crowd together like oversize furniture squeezed into a small room. These features somehow transform for each role lurching from gorgeous to plain and back again.         When she stripped off her novelty T-shirt (the Beatles sporting red noses) and capri pants changing into the severe structured rather sexy costumes designed by Catherine Zuber her face suddenly seemed sterner more intimidating more beautiful. Then she dispelled the illusion with jokes. This is a little bit of loungewear she said deadpan as she adjusted a magnificent gown. Just the right side of S-and-M.         Pliability and liveliness alone dont explain why directors want to work with her. Rather its an ability to force herself go almost translucent making the feelings of her characters seem blatant palpable. She has what her Macbeth co-star Ethan Hawke calls a huge trove of emotion and seems able to open it at will. As Mr. Godwin said Its the meeting of the character and Anne-Maries soul which makes her such an extraordinary performer.         Ms. Duff hasnt always found it easy to untangle her characters souls from her own. Years ago Howard Davies who directed her in Donald Marguliess Collected Stories in London spoke of her throwing herself on parts as if bruising herself on them.         But having recently turned 43 she has learned to protect herself somewhat. Obviously I have an ability to take care of myself or I wouldnt be able to play all these crazy women she said.         Still she acknowledged there are always elements of a character that will haunt you plague you for the duration of playing them. Regarding Lady Macbeth Ms. Duff speculated Her sadness her anxiety will probably be with me.         She also suggested that the emotional journey of the couple in Macbeth influenced her decision not to play opposite Mr. McAvoy whose movies include Atonement and the X-Men series. Hes my husband she said. I didnt want to go through that every night with him.         Yet Ms. Duff does seem to have drawn on her own experiences to inhabit Lady Macbeth whom Shakespeares source Holinsheds Chronicles  describes as  very ambitious burning with an unquenchable desire to bear the name of a queen.         Though Ms. Duff seems rather less ruthless she did work from her understanding of wanting things to work within love and her experience of being married to an incredibly successful man. She always works from the inside out she said: I dont find a good pair of shoes and go Oh Ive found her.Â          Ms. Duff said she never had much difficulty empathizing with a character no matter how thorny or murderous. Of Lady Macbeths conduct she reasoned: Its heinous behavior its bizarre behavior but its her behavior. So I have to embrace it.         Mr. Hawke observed that while a lot of people pose or shade a character to make them likable Anne-Marie has a quality where shes able to just give herself over to it fully.         Even though Ms. Duff does indeed give herself fully to her roles she has learned to restrain herself in the rehearsal room. Asked about her reputed daring Mr. OBrien replied: Shes elegantly fearless and brave. I think there is an almost bashful apology for the fact that shes so emotionally accessible. She doesnt wish to show off in a vulgar way.         Ms. Duff does have unexpected streaks of modesty. Asked if shed like to model the various underpinnings Ms. Zuber had selected she politely declined. But well have a knickers party she told Ms. Zuber sweetly. Thatll be fun.        
384,100000002536928,0,Article,News,Arts,arts,design,Sidestepping the Digital Demimonde,MELENA RYZIK,1540,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/arts/design/sidestepping-the-digital-demimonde.html,1,In 1979  the photographer Lucian Perkins  stumbled into a seminal moment in music history. He didnt know it at the time of course. He was 26 a photography intern at The Washington Post when by chance he heard an emerging punk band Bad Brains playing above a Washington restaurant. Investigating he found a roomful of teenagers dancing with sweaty abandon. It was a cool scene that no one really knew about said Mr. Perkins now a two-time Pulitzer winner and it piqued my interest to start documenting it.         At makeshift clubs his was habitually the only camera in the room.Â He said Can I take your picture? and I probably tried to look cool as any 14-year-old would said Vivien Greene whom Mr. Perkins captured in her bleached-blonde years. But I was there for a show not to be photographed.         Those kinds of happenings  indie cheap frenetic  still take place today at countless grungy spaces around the country except theres not one camera in the room but hundreds. Grotty  basement shows Â scavenged-art  installations  far-flung  site-specific performances :Â All are zoomed in on and shared mapped and located turning what were niche events into potential spectacles.         Word of mouth is instant publicly broadcast over social media. The boundary around the mainstream is more porous now changing the very definition of being underground.         It really is an amazing transformation said  Ross Haenfler Â  an associate professor of sociology at the University of Mississippi and the author of Subcultures: The Basics published last month.         You used to have to be really in the know he said. If youre at a certain punk show at CBGBs that had a certain cachet. If you had an original T-shirt from a first Metallica show that is really something. Youd have to scour record bins to get an original pressing. Now all of that stuff is available via YouTube and eBay. It really changes the dynamic.         By contrast few of Mr. Perkinss punk images were seen until decades later when an assistant came across the unlabeled negatives in his archives. A book Hard Art DC 1979 published in June reveals the origins of the movement that birthed the band Minor Threat and Dischord Records. If he had taken those same photos now Mr. Perkins said he would have posted them online right away. The underground culture that no one knew about that had time to percolate and find its voice might have instead been discovered tout de suite with who knows what effect on its artistic output and reach.         Where once the counterculture prided itself on obscurity now the idea of being invisible is less seductive to people said Fred Ritchin a professor of photography and imaging at New York University. More and more things are done to be photographed. They dont count unless theyre photographed.Â          And it once took time for the mainstream to catch up to those images for Macys to carry a line of clothes that looked punk said Ms. Greene the teenage D.C. punker now a senior curator of early 19th- and 20th-century art at the Guggenheim Museum. Now I think the cycles are much more abbreviated.         Artists who transitioned from avant-garde to pop experienced the pressure of visibility firsthand.         It was relatively easy said David Byrne back in the day to work with only a smallish number of people watching as we sometimes succeeded and sometimes failed. In the mid-70s the early days of his band Talking Heads we felt comfortable trying out different things songs that were quickly abandoned and stage wear that proved impractical he wrote in an email. Thats all hugely important (the songs part anyway) as it allowed us to explore refine our identity and go down those musical dead ends without the embarrassment of public scrutiny.         Now online exposure can make for an overnight viral sensation. But it can also destroy and eliminate that crucial period of anonymity he said. The Internet giveth and the Internet taketh away.Â          Artists who document life on the fringes have a birds-eye view of these changes.  Tod Seelie  a Brooklyn photographer has spent 15 years shooting in mosh pits and abandoned buildings images collected in Bright Nights: Photographs of Another New York published this month. It showcases a thriving outsiderness which has lately become much less rarefied in part because Mr. Seelie himself has been posting photos online since 2003.        
385,100000002535917,0,Article,News,Movies,movies,,Love Story That Was a Challenge to Tell,LARRY ROHTER,1310,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/movies/reaching-for-the-moon-a-film-about-elizabeth-bishop.html,18,Its not unusual especially these days for a film to have a lengthy gestation period. But  Reaching for the Moon  a new drama about the tempestuous love affair between the American poet  Elizabeth Bishop  and the Brazilian landscape architect Carlota de Macedo Soares has by any standard been an exceptionally long time in the making.         Though the movie opened Friday its origins date to 1959 when the Brazilian film producer Lucy Barreto was invited to a luncheon at Samambaia the mountain estate near Rio de Janeiro where Bishop and Macedo Soares lived. Prominent Brazilian poets and politicians were among the guests and the house itself was decorated with paintings and sculpture by renowned artists but it was the hostesses who left her with her most vivid memory.         What impressed me was the intimacy and complicity between the two of them Ms. Barreto recalled recently. At times one would be on one side of the room and the second on the other side in different conversations. But one would look at the other with a half-smile and you could see they were in constant communication. It was something very special and I never forgot it.         So when in 1995 the Brazilian writer Carmen Oliveira published Rare and Commonplace Flowers a Portuguese-language book about Bishop and Macedo Soares and their years together that was  later translated  into English Ms. Barreto immediately bought the film rights. By then both Bishop and Macedo Soares usually just called Lota were dead but their romance lived out discreetly had retrospectively become a symbol of lesbian pride and autonomy.         At a low point creatively Bishop reserved by nature full of self-doubt and battling a drinking problem had arrived in Rio in 1951 intending to spend just a few days. But she met Lota domineering and outgoing quickly moved in with her and ended up staying nearly 20 years in Brazil where she produced work that won her both the Pulitzer Prize and the  National Book Award . Posthumously Bishop has also become  a cultural talisman in Brazil  her work increasingly read and admired by the intellectual elite there.         To direct the story of the two women Ms. Barreto wanted her son Bruno whose credits include the international hit  Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands  (1978) and the Oscar-nominated  Four Days in September  (1997). But it would take more than a decade to convince him and several more years before she could raise the $6 million the film ultimately cost and assemble a cast that includes Miranda Otto as Bishop and GlÃ³ria Pires as Lota.         Mr. Barreto said that when his mother first sent him the Oliveira book he dutifully read it but the obvious story of Bishop in Brazil and the clash of cultures didnt interest him enough to sign on. The last thing I wanted to make was another film about a tortured artist he said. I hate those films. Ive seen them and I am always very bored.         Nearly a decade ago though the actress Amy Irving then his wife saw A Safe Harbor for Elizabeth Bishop a one-character Brazilian play that she decided to  perform in an English-language version . As Ms. Irving researched the role he paid close attention to the information she was accumulating and he said began to think there was something to be told there.         But the real turning point came when he started to read Bishops poetry. He found her 1950s poems about Brazil to be so up-to-date that its as if shes writing about today he said. He was particularly moved by the well-known  One Art  which begins: The art of losing isnt hard to master;/so many things seemed filled with the intent/to be lost that their loss is no disaster.         Mr. Barreto said: For me if Im going to tell the story its about loss how if you want to win you also have to know how to lose. It has since dawned on me that I really found the angle for the story when I was getting divorced from Amy. That was a big loss losing her.         From the beginning Ms. Barreto had also been clear on who should play Lota: Ms. Pires a popular telenovela star in Brazil who has also acted in films including  O Quatrilho  (1995) which was directed by Mr. Barretos brother FÃ¡bio and was nominated for an Oscar. Ms. Pires said she had never heard of Lota when Ms. Barreto approached her in 1995 but was fascinated by the Oliveira book and waited patiently year after year as Ms. Barreto tried to get the film off the ground.         I think that in this case time was helpful because it allowed me to mature as a woman and mature as an artist she said. And as I was working on other projects over the years this story was always echoing in my head. Every time I thought about it I could visualize the script I had received in the beginning and keep on thinking about these two women and the family nucleus they created. I needed that time because while theres a lot of material about Bishop available theres very little about Lota.         Ms. Otto came to the film in exactly the opposite way: in a hurry and almost at the last minute. She was working on a film in Melbourne Australia one weekend early last year when she received an email with the script and an invitation to play Bishop. The email also asked for a commitment to begin shooting in a couple of months and she recalled for a response within 48 hours.         So I read the script and couldnt believe my luck she said. These were two women who were strong and intelligent and passionate living such a modern uncompromised life. To get something as rich as that its not easy to find. And Id never been to South America and always wanted to go to Rio.         To prepare Ms. Otto took a crash course in all things Bishop. She said she read  Remembering Elizabeth Bishop: An Oral Biography  that was a gold mine of anecdotes and different peoples impressions of her some favorable and others not so favorable and listened closely to recordings of Bishop reading her poems. (Shortly before shooting started Ms. Pires also found a book Nadia Nogueiras Self-Inventions in Love Stories: Lota Macedo Soares and Elizabeth Bishop that gave her the information she felt she had been lacking as she tried to shape her portrayal of Lota.)         Ms. Otto said that Bishop was so intensely private that Im sure she would be absolutely appalled at the idea of a film about her relationship with Lota. But  Reaching for the Moon  is also about the way the balance of power can sometimes shift in a relationship. As Mr. Barreto noted Bishop a dysfunctional alcoholic and drifter becomes stronger while Lota becomes weaker and more obsessed both with Bishop and with a massive public works project in Rio under her stewardship. So theres a reversal of roles.         In Brazil where the film opened in August Reaching for the Moon has been an art-house success. But it has also encountered difficulty in getting access to cineplexes with some critics and bloggers describing it as a gay romance and others focusing on the political infighting surrounding Lotas largely forgotten role in creating  Flamengo Park  a huge bayside esplanade and commons that has become one of Rios signature attractions. But the Barretos cautioned that it would be a mistake to take so narrow a view. Its a mainstream film Ms. Barreto said.         Mr. Barreto added: Its not a biopic and its not a gay love story. Its just a love story. He continued I didnt want it to be Bishops story or Lotas story.

386,100000002536291,0,Article,News,Movies,movies,homevideo,"John Ford, on Uncommon Ground",DAVE KEHR,1587,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/movies/homevideo/tcm-offers-john-ford-the-columbia-films-collection.html,15,Turner Classic Movies Columbia Pictures and the Film Foundation have pooled their resources to create John Ford: The Columbia Films Collection a most welcome boxed set that brings together five films directed by that dean of American filmmakers.         Three have not previously appeared on DVD in the United States:  The Whole Towns Talking  a Depression-era comedy with Jean Arthur and Edward G. Robinson;  Gideons Day  a police procedural filmed in England in 1958 with Jack Hawkins as the Scotland Yard inspector created by the novelist John Creasey; and  Two Rode Together  a major Ford western from 1961 with James Stewart Richard Widmark and Shirley Jones.         The other two films in the collection have long been out of print:  The Long Gray Line  the 1955 story of a long-serving West Point instructor (Tyrone Power) and Fords first film in CinemaScope and The Last Hurrah his 1958 adaptation of a best-selling novel by Edwin OConnor with Spencer Tracy as an aging politician facing his last campaign.         Most of these movies are outliers in Fords career films that find him working in genres or formats with which he wasnt usually associated. Even Two Rode Together  superficially the most Fordian film of the bunch if only because it is a western  drifts off the beaten trail of the genre and touches on elements of gothic horror.         The Whole Towns Talking from 1935 is a brisk topical urban comedy that allows the great Robinson to slip back and forth between the poles of his performance range  he plays both a shyly romantic office drone and a cold sadistic thug. Youre automatically tempted to describe the film as Capraesque until you remember that Frank Capra had only established himself as a comedy director a year earlier with  It Happened One Night.   It might be more accurate to call  Mr. Deeds Goes to Town  Fordian. Deeds released in 1936 cemented Capras reputation for social comedy. But it was Ford who uncovered Jean Arthurs gift for comedy; previously she was an undistinguished contract player. It was Ford who first cast her as a tough-talking professional woman in tailored suits.         It may be the westerns and war movies that are the foundation of his reputation today but throughout his long career  over 140 films though most of the silent movies are lost  Ford remained on the surface at least a remarkably protean filmmaker. His sense of himself as an unflappable professional allowed him to take on the most unlikely projects  a vehicle for the child star Shirley Temple for example  just as the strength of his vision and the power of his technique could conform those unlikely projects into works of deep personal import. (The Temple film  Wee Willie Winkie  was perhaps the first of Fords films to deal with a theme that would become central to his work after World War II: the social structure of a military encampment.)         As well as The Whole Towns Talking turned out the strong-willed Ford most likely chafed under the command of Columbias autocratic head of production Harry Cohn. Twenty years would pass until Ford would return to Columbia and then only because Columbia had inherited a property Ford very much wanted to film  the life story of Marty Maher an Irish immigrant who arrived at West Point as a civilian kitchen worker and remained for 50 years as a beloved noncommissioned officer and swimming instructor (even though at least according to Fords film he didnt know how to swim).         The Long Gray Line belongs to a cluster of films about marriage  a subject that rarely engaged Ford before  that pops up in his filmography of the 1950s. Contrasting the intimate union of a man and a woman with the social and emotional cohesiveness of the closed military communities that had long fascinated Ford these movies conjugate marriage through many different forms  as dying and dysfunctional (Rio Grande 1950) as a battle of equally strong-willed partners ( The Quiet Man  1952) as an artificial imposition of monogamy on a natural world of spontaneous desire ( Mogambo  1953) as a relationship narrowed by dependence and enforced domesticity ( The Wings of Eagles  1957).         In The Long Gray Line the protagonists loyalties seem equally divided between the institution he serves (West Point) and the woman he loves (another Irish immigrant played with uncharacteristic girlishness by the Amazonian Maureen OHara). The film ends by imagining a perfect union of these two apparently conflicting desires (as if Marty and his wife had become as permanent a part of West Point as the obsolete but immovable cannons that protect its perimeter)  the personal blending with the institutional.         In this context the underrated Gideons Day  seen here in color although Columbia had so little faith in it in 1958 that the studio released the film in black-and-white prints as Gideon of Scotland Yard  takes on a new significance. As Inspector Gideon (Hawkins to whom Ford has lent his own trademark pipe) makes his way through a typically demanding day he deals with cases that pointedly concern differently allied couples  including a Cockney petty criminal (Cyril Cusack) and his protective wife (Maureen Potter) and a corrupt member of his own staff (Derek Bond) who has betrayed his wife (Grizelda Hervey) as well as his colleagues.         Throughout Ford cuts back and forth between Gideons office and his home where his loyal wife (the wistful Ford regular Anna Lee) and marriageable daughter (Anna Massey in her first movie role) proudly and patiently accept the responsibilities that come with a life of public service (Scotland Yard having become a branch of the United States Cavalry). In the late films however the issue of marriage drops away and Fords heroes increasingly find themselves isolated (like Spencer Tracys widowed mayor in The Last Hurrah) or cynical and bluntly misanthropic.         Two Rode Together finds its most intimate moment in an unbroken four-minute shot in which a career officer (Richard Widmark) and a mercenary Indian trader (James Stewart) exchange their views on women and independence. But this comic sequence proves to be the lead-in to a nightmarish evocation of domestic life gone wrong as Widmark and Stewart enter an encampment of traumatized families each hoping that Stewart will be able to negotiate the release of a member held captive by Comanches. The love of a husband for his wife or a mother for her child proves to be pitifully inadequate in the face of the cultural divide that has risen between them.         Fords darkest and most bitter film Two Rode Together opens into the mythic perspective of  The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance  (1962) where the shortcomings of human relations are subsumed by the greater march of civilization  a glorious lie masking an unbearable truth. Fords questioning of his fundamental principles continued through his final feature 7 Women in 1966 never abandoning the restless intellect formal mastery and Shakespearean capacity for consuming and expressing the great and awful complexity of human emotion that made this son of an immigrant Irish saloonkeeper one of the greatest of all American artists. 
387,100000002536566,0,Article,News,Movies,movies,,Dern Has a Story for You,LOGAN HILL,1903,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/movies/a-star-turn-at-77-in-alexander-paynes-nebraska.html,1,In late May in a gaudy hotel suite brimming with tuxedoed film executives at the  Cannes Film Festival  a publicist was pacing anxiously. Bruce weve got to go she said. Then Bruce its time. Next she tried Bruce were going to be late before finally resorting to Bruce please they cant start without you.         Some actors attain celebrity before they know what to do with it; others project a diffidence to fame while secretly craving it; and some just dont appreciate their numbered moments in the spotlight. Then there is Bruce Dern who was so busy enjoying the moment that he was dangerously close to being late for the world premiere of  Nebraska  the film he hopes will finally give him the validation he yearns for.         Just a second just a second Mr. Dern said a plume of wild white hair crashing like ocean spray across his head. He was half-dressed in crisp tuxedo pants with just a white undershirt and as always hopping from one topic to another. Now where was I?         In the film directed by Alexander Payne Mr. Dern plays Woody a wobbly hard-of-hearing retired grouch who edging toward senility becomes convinced that he is a sweepstakes millionaire. He embarks on a road trip from Billings Mont. to Lincoln Neb. to claim his nonexistent winnings with his son played by Will Forte. Woody is confused alcoholic and so taciturn he is practically mute. In these ways he is the exact opposite of Mr. Dern who has never touched alcohol shuns caffeine and is always in the middle of some dizzyingly digressive story.         Yet like Woody with the sweepstakes mailing Mr. Dern sees  Nebraska  opening on Friday in the United States as his golden ticket the reason for an unlikely career peak at the age of 77.         How he got here is the subject of the story he is still telling much to his publicists audible dismay.         Obsessed with Hollywood history and blessed with a fast-as-Google recall of film trivia (and obscure track-and-field stats) Mr. Dern has been talking so much about shooting John Wayne in the back (in 1972s  The Cowboys ) crashing a blimp into the Super Bowl (in 1977s  Black Sunday)   earning a supporting-actor Oscar nomination opposite Jane Fonda (in 1978s  Coming Home ) and working with greats like Alfred Hitchcock that he was only just getting to the good part. Literally the good part: the one he worked 55 years to get as the lead role always seemed to go to someone else like his pal Jack Nicholson.         Its the best role Ive ever had and the most exciting to shoot day to day said Mr. Dern who pursued Mr. Payne for eight years after reading the script by Bob Nelson. Every day you go to work theres a chance you just might do something nobodys ever done.         The publicist said Bruce we have to go. Finally Mr. Dern relented and got dressed promising to resume the conversation at a later date. Minutes later he was walking the red carpet with his daughter the actress Laura Dern.         Within hours he would be timing a raucous standing ovation that according to his watch lasted for exactly 11 minutes (three more he would later boast than the ovation Mr. Nicholson received when he starred in the Payne film  About Schmidt ). A few days after that Mr. Dern won the Cannes festivals best actor award.         Five months later in a hotel room in Midtown Manhattan Mr. Dern a former marathon runner was wearing another white T-shirt this time under a warm cardigan and was picking up right where he left off. So far he said he has seen Nebraska 17 or 18 times on his promotional tour. Paramount is concerned that Ill get tired on this trip he added. They said You dont have to sit through every screening. Well I want to see my team play! Yeah I get tired but who cares?         Mr. Payne said he had never known an actor like Mr. Dern. He has seen the finished version more times than I have  by far he said. At this time in his life in his third act as they say to have a big part and to be receiving some kudos means a lot to him. He has a lot to give and he wants to work.         On this last desire Mr. Dern is adamant. His wish even at his age he said is to be on a set seven months a year on different movies where Im El Jefe  or one of the jefes  Id be so happy. Id live for that. I love making movies.         Mr. Dern wasnt supposed to make movies at all which has always been part of the kick. For him working in the Method rigor of the Actors Studio with Lee Strasberg and Elia Kazan then grinding through the B-movie mayhem of Roger Corman was a form of rebellion. He grew up in a wealthy old-money family in Chicago the grandson of George Henry Dern a two-term Utah governor and a secretary of war under Franklin D. Roosevelt.         Mr. Derns great-uncle was the poet Archibald MacLeish whom he quotes liberally. His godparents were Adlai Stevenson and Eleanor Roosevelt. At the dinner table he was required to wear white gloves follow the rules and defer to guests like Uncle Archie and Thurgood Marshall.        
388,100000002539262,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,A Zingone in Every Aisle,SYLVIE BIGAR,623,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/nyregion/a-zingone-in-every-aisle.html,3,Me? Im from Columbus Avenue said Dominick Zingone 53 a tall and suave member of the clan behind Zingone Brothers an old-fashioned grocery store on the Upper West Side. And thats exactly how the rest of the Zingones feel. No one has forgotten that Grandpa Domenico left the lemon groves of Praiano on the Amalfi Coast at 15 crossed to the New World on the Giuseppe Verdi and landed at Ellis Island on Sept. 3 1920 but since 1927 a Zingone has been selling produce on the avenue.         First Domenico and his older brother Vincenzo ran a fruit and vegetable stand in a deli down the street said Angelo Zingone 73 as he delicately laid peaches on a shelf. Cousin Angelo has worked in the spot between 82nd and 83rd Streets for 55 years and he talks to the family in a Neapolitan dialect.         Grandpa moved to this location in 1935 Dominicks sister Mary 50 chimed in but at the time he shared the space with Quality Poultry see? She points to the faded black-and-white photograph hanging above the register where a cousin Richie 48 or Nick-Anthony 42 usually presides most mornings at least until their father Nick 77 comes back from his run to Hunts Point Market. Its not that theres a family reunion at the store its just the way business is done at Zingone.         From the worn linoleum floor to the tin ceiling the grocery is stocked with beer and mousetraps Italian bread from Arthur Avenue in the Bronx organic eggs and Listerine and according to Bill Durkin who runs the Gypsy Wolf Cantina in Woodstock N.Y. Zingone Brothers has the best price on the best tomatoes. He wouldnt think of using any others for his salsa and he drives to Manhattan every Thursday to get them.         Oliver a blondish portly cat welcomes a steady flow of customers including on one recent day some workers from a construction site nearby and a television executive and his son. A nanny forces a large stroller through the shops two narrow aisles.         In from the cold one afternoon walked Joe Lucatorto a mailman known as Joe Lucky who delivers on Route 13. Did you bring the shorts today? Richie asked. Of course Mr. Lucatorto said though he was wearing long pants. You never know.         It seems everyone is on first-name basis and the question asked most often is Hows Josephine? Until a fall last year Josephine Zingone Dominick and Marys 81-year-old mother had been a daily caring presence at the register since 1976 the year her husband Ralph died. I miss everybody she said on one of the days she came to the store to meet Mary who was giving her a ride to the doctor. What can I do?         I have a hard time not coming by every day said Kay Greenspon who lives a block away. I love that its an old-fashioned store that theyre starting to carry organic.         Over the years celebrities became regulars: Peter Jennings Sidney Lumet Keanu Reeves Glenn Close and Matt Dillon.         Leonard Bernsteins housekeeper would call and we would deliver to the Dakota Richie Zingone said. Jerry Seinfeld and Jessica Sklar had separate house accounts before they got married so afterward we just merged them.         The Zingones deliver of course; they manage about 300 house charges they hold UPS packages for their regulars and theyve even been known to in a pinch  drive a customer to the doctor .         Some things have changed. The Zingones own their building now and they sell coconut water. But in the afternoons after school the fourth generation (age 3 to 13) trickles in. Theres laughter theres banter. And that as much as the tomatoes is what keeps the customers coming back.        
389,100000002538876,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Everything’s Broken? Then Let the Show Begin,JAMES KINDALL,942,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/nyregion/broken-fix-it-exhibition-at-long-island-childrens-museum.html,7,By the time Alaina Herman was finished with the Broken? Fix It! exhibition at the  Long Island Childrens Museum  she had learned how to rebuild a brick wall change the oil in a car and glue a cracked china plate back together. But what really caught her attention was a demonstration on repairing window screens.         Her grandmother had one that needed fixing Alaina 12 said. Now thanks to what she learned from the display she decided she was going to tackle the job herself. It didnt hurt that Grandma who had brought Alaina and her 9-year-old brother Jake to the museum had also mentioned payment.         Id like that Alaina said an entrepreneurial gleam in her eye.         A can-do attitude is what museum officials were hoping to generate when they opened the exhibition in late July according to Maureen P. Mangan the museums director of communications and marketing.         Children used to learn about things like this in home economics classes or shop but thats been phased out in some schools and kids today have lost that knowledge Ms. Mangan said. We want them to realize they have the ability to fix things.         Most of the children examining the more than 200 objects in the room seemed to get the message quickly. They rolled underneath a plywood car chassis to study how to change the oil. Some learned how to fix a beheaded toy dinosaur by gluing a dowel  a.k.a. a pencil  in its neck.         Other stations gave youngsters a crack at repairing watches jewelry bicycles and electronics as well as putting a torn book back together. Often parents got involved. Indeed Dawn Weiss the senior exhibit and program developer said she had witnessed the ultimate compliment for a childrens display. Ive actually seen parents put down their cellphones and play with their kids Ms. Weiss said.         At the shoe repair stop Edward Cortes from Hollis Queens put a mock shine on the tennis shoes of his daughters Brianna 10 and Sophia 4 with a brush. It took the entire family including Sandra Cortes the childrens mother to reconstruct a wall from a nearby bin of foam bricks. Naturally the children tore it down as soon as it was finished.         Still Sandra Cortes said Everywhere we stopped we learned something.         The idea of addressing societys throwaway mentality in a bilingual (Spanish-English) exhibition came out of a committee meeting when members observed that workers making repairs always draw attention Ms. Weiss said.         Its like when people gather around to watch a workman fix a broken window she said. Thats something thats real not esoteric and Ive always found that fascinating. But turning that concept into something tangible was difficult.         The exhibition represents an important step for the Garden City museum because it is the first show it has created that will be lent to other museums. A two-year tour begins in January and will include two childrens museums in California  in Sausalito and San Jose  as well as museums in Boston; St. Paul; and Bridgeport Conn. At the tours end it will be available for rent to other institutions.         In addition to participating in the hands-on displays visitors paused to view instructional videos at five stops. In one they saw a car engine being disassembled and rebuilt in time lapse. In another a Long Island fisherman called Captain Tony explained how he mended his fishing nets.         One of the more popular videos featured Audra Fordin a mechanic and an owner of a car repair shop in Flushing Queens who runs a website called  Women Auto Know . The museum filmed her explaining the basics of car care and encouraging women to make their own diagnoses on car-repair issues.         AllÂ the girls and the women love that Ms. Weiss said.         This empowerment theme struck a chord with Phyllis Herman of Elmont Alaina and Jakes grandmother. She raised three sons as a single parent she said. With money tight she learned to fix everything around the house herself mostly using the advice of friends.         Its the same way kids are learning here she said looking around the room. This builds up their self-confidence and teaches them not to be afraid to try something. She also said they learned not to be afraid to fail.         Remember these things may look simple to us but to a child they can look complicated Ms. Herman said         In what Ms. Weiss called the emotional heart of the exhibit children and parents had the chance to enter a Truth Booth to confess what they had broken in the past (they also could don a virtual disguise during the narrative).         On the side of the booth a telephone allows visitors to listen to past recorded confessions; a  compilation of them can also be heard online .         Parents confessed such transgressions as I broke the toilet; I made my husband fix it.         Youngsters got some things off their chest too.         O.K. I broke a glass plate and I blamed it on my sister said one little girl her voice trailing off in guilt.         A few confessions were surprising.         Sometimes its not just things you can break one girl said. Its hearts and emotions.         Alaina of Plainview acknowledged some breakage herself. Ive broken a lot of things she said. My desk. My chair. Its leg fell off.         But now she had the answer she said: They show you how to fix that here too.         Her brother was also enthusiastic about the visit. When he walked into the exhibition he wanted to be a mechanic. The auto display enlarged those ambitions. Now I want to be in charge of a pit crew Jake said.         Broken? Fix It! runs through Jan. 5 at the Long Island Childrens Museum 11 Davis Avenue Garden City; (516) 224-5800. How-to videos from the exhibition can be seen at  licm.org .

Willers director of the museum.         Its kind of hard to believe that he had this whole body of work that had never been seen considering he is one of the most known and familiar artists in the world Dr. Willers said.         The body of work in question consists of pen-and-ink drawings dating from the 1960s to the present; around 120 are on display in seven of the museums major galleries alongside about 60 of Mr. Maxs paintings some of which are familiar from popular posters. Until now the pen-and-ink drawings had not been publicly shown. Selected by Mr. Max from his archives in Manhattan the drawings touch on themes commonly explored in his paintings including angels celestial bodies and spiritual leaders such as swamis.         Im going to sound egotistical but what I felt when I was pulling them for the museum was These are really good drawingsÂ  Mr. Max 76 of Manhattan said in a recent phone interview.         Mr. Maxs association with the museum came about through a board member who is a collector of his work Dr. Willers said. Mr. Max donated signed prints of his work to be auctioned at a museum fund-raiser in 2011; later Dr. Willers visited Mr. Maxs studio.         Right off the bat I was interested in the drawings Dr. Willers said. Peter has kept almost every drawing hes ever done. And hes one of the most prolific drawers among living artists.  Jasper Johns  draws a lot.  Ellsworth Kelly  draws a lot. It may be less known that Peter Max draws a lot.         Mr. Max will be at the museum on Feb. 2 for a Peter Max Family Day from 1 to 4 p.m. He will talk with visitors and children will be invited to color one of his drawings in a contest to be judged by the artist. Before then it is likely that Mr. Max will have completed more drawings.         I always have the urge to draw Mr. Max said. And I never know what Im drawing. Its very inventive.         Peter Max at the Nassau County Museum of Art 1 Museum Drive Roslyn Harbor through Feb. 23 2014. For more information:  nassaumuseum.org  or (516) 484-9337.

391,100000002539049,0,Article,Review,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,"For the Beer, for the Food, for the Feeling",EMILY DeNITTO,632,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/nyregion/a-review-of-the-tapp-in-tarrytown.html,8,The couple had just taken a big step: getting engaged. And of all the places they could have gone to celebrate on a recent fall evening they chose the Tapp a one-year-old bar in Tarrytown. Cuddling in a corner and showing her ring to the waitress and other patrons as they gathered around the two had a grand time.         The Tapp is a simple-looking place. It has some nice touches like the warm glow cast by Edison light bulbs the section of exposed brick behind the bar and the high ceiling but its appeal is not immediately obvious. Then you sit for a while and the feel of the place takes hold. The waitress Piper swings her long blond dreadlocks as she acknowledges regulars. Doug Benson a patron who is so popular there a drink has been named after him is probably sitting at the bar. And the tables are packed with local residents.         They come for the 10 draft lines of craft beer and the specialty drinks. They come as the engaged couple did for the welcoming ambience. And many of the customers  on the two nights I visited it was most  come for the food. The Tapp has a closet of a kitchen that is so small it is not zoned for open flames and can use only convection ovens and electric burners. But with a farm-to-table approach Alexa Wilkinson the chef is turning out appealing fare that goes far beyond the usual bar grub.         House-made hummus chunky and full of flavor is an example of how the Tapp blends sweet and savory. The spread had a spicy kick but was also drizzled with a balsamic glaze. The terrific charcuterie plate featured salty black olives and cured meats alongside sweet fig goat cheese and blueberry goat cheese. And caramelized onions and ripe tomato chunks teased out the sharper tastes of feta cheese red onion and spinach sandwiched between two warm tortillas in the Grecian piada.         A recent special of pumpkin sage and citrus bisque showcased Ms. Wilkinsons focus on seasonal ingredients. Thin and subtle the soup was a lovely start to a meal. Local apple slices drizzled with honey appear in a salad the Tapp calls fallin blue: mixed greens blue cheese and crushed spiced peanuts. Apple slices are tucked alongside the tasty ricotta cheesecake also drizzled with honey; the apples are even listed as toppings for the 12-inch pizzas.         Those pizzas have crusts so thin they are almost crackerlike and can be ordered with more than a dozen toppings from house pickles to soppressata. A basic version with tomato sauce and mozzarella was light and fresh; another with fried eggs thick smoky bacon pieces and caramelized onions was a delicious meal.         If you are hungry you will probably have to make your dinner out of several items. The regular menu offers only small plates salads the pizzas and sandwiches. But given that the Tapp is basically a bar the quality and heft of the food is a welcome surprise. Even items that did not succeed as well had merit: meatball sliders were a bit too dense but had great flavor and the smoked Venice Beach salad was nearly drowned in mango salsa but the crispy bacon ripe avocado and fresh tomato still came through.         Appropriately the Tapp has fun mixing alcohol with its food. The mac and cheese is finished with weissbier draft. A port-veined Cheddar was a highlight of that charcuterie plate. And a trio of gelatos can be ordered drizzled with appropriate spirits.         That dessert is a pleasant way to end a meal  or toast a marriage to be. Diving into her gelato the newly engaged woman looked at her fiancÃ© and smiled widely. This she told him was the perfect place to come.                    The Tapp

A widow for 10 years now Vera the heroine of  Amy Herzog s intricate and wise 4000 Miles lives in a book-lined rent-controlled apartment in Greenwich Village (a two-bedroom for $1200 a month). Her biggest responsibility is to telephone her neighbor across the hall daily to make sure she is still alive. So when Veras grandson Leo shows up  unexpected unannounced unshowered and unapologetic at 3 in the morning  his arrival is both a disruption and a welcome piece of human contact. He ends up staying three weeks.         When 4000 Miles opened at Lincoln Center in 2012 (there was a smaller production the year before) New York critics fell all over themselves praising it. Time magazine called it the best play of the year. The Obie Awards gave it that honor officially. Charles Isherwood writing in The New York Times called it  the rare theatrical production that achieves greatness on its own terms.    In the  Hudson Stage Company s new Briarcliff Manor production at Woodward Hall Theater at Pace University directed by Dan Foster Ms. Herzogs script still shines  it is very nearly perfect with exposition as smooth and sweet as French butter  but a good bit of the plays sparkle is missing.         When Mary Louise Wilson walked across the Lincoln Center stage as Vera a powerful force was felt. This is an elderly woman clearly. There are repeated references to dentures and hearing aids (one of the funniest lines near the end in fact) and she does not walk like a young woman but hers is a fierce presence and a whole lifetime of strength and opinions simmers just beneath the surface.         When Alice Cannon a fine actress who was in the original Broadway production of Company hobbles across the Woodward Hall stage there is a sense that this woman was born old and has accepted the frailties of age as just about what she deserves. Mr. Foster Ms. Cannon or perhaps both seem to have decided that little old ladies are just that. And when a little old lady does unusual things like smoke marijuana with her grandson casually discuss her acceptance of her two husbands infidelities and remember the good old days as an enthusiastic American Communist the behavior just seems heaven help us cute.         Jacob Perkins who plays Leo is convincingly young. Leo 21 has just completed a cross-country bicycle trip which began in Seattle and was interrupted (but not ended) by tragedy. A friends death is involved and Leo is shaken to the core.         Mr. Perkinss finest moment is his monologue about what happened that day accented by Andrew Gmosers very low mood lighting and Anthony Mattanas sound design with the whir of Manhattan traffic simultaneously faint and insistent. It is one of those lovely theatrical instances when the audience seems to hold its collective breath.         The rest of the time Mr. Perkinss Leo is an eye roller. This may be true to his character a guy whose biggest ambition at the moment seems to be to find a place in the neighborhood with a climbing wall. But theres something particularly mean about the way he makes fun of Veras still having a copy of the Yellow Pages around. The devil is in the tone not the written lines.         What year is this? The program says only September of a recent year. We know it is the 21st century because one character asks if Vera whose living room has a fabulous view watched the Trade Center towers fall on Sept. 11. Vera also owns a MacBook (virtually untouched) and Leo uses it along with an unsuspecting neighbors Wi-Fi to Skype his sister back in Minnesota.         David L. Arsenaults scenery is just what it should be although it is surprising that Vera still has a black rotary-dial wall phone. You wonder if anyone has told her that the Bell System broke up.         There are unseen characters in 4000 Miles  Leos mother to whom he is not speaking; his sister Lily whom he adores; and Veras neighbor Jenny who comes to life through the magic of a Google search. Two others both young women make actual onstage appearances.         Ella Dershowitz is sweet and appealing as Bec Leos conflicted former girlfriend now in college in New York. But only Nadia Gan as Amanda an intoxicated free spirit whom Leo has just met and brought home for some grief-soothing casual sex escapes the productions deadliness.         Granted Amandas one scene is a mini-masterpiece of comic relief anyway but Ms. Gan plays it to the hilt. So we are sorry that she is upset when she learns about Veras political past which she surmises from the titles in the bookcase.         Leo doesnt understand why Amanda reacts so strongly to the mention of Communists. Duh! Im Chinese she answers.         He tries to explain that everybody in his grandmothers generation dabbled in Communism. It was a fashion. It was the right thing to do. He summarizes It was like it was like  recycling.         4000 Miles by Amy Herzog is at Woodward Hall Theater Pace University 235 Elm Road Briarcliff Manor through Nov. 16.

393,100000002538828,0,Article,News,Real Estate,realestate,,West 57th’s Hodgepodge Block,CHRISTOPHER GRAY,826,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/realestate/west-57ths-hodgepodge-block.html,4,The developer Extell now has the go-ahead from the Landmarks Preservation Commission to cantilever a 1400-foot tower over the Art Students League at 215 West 57th Street which will create certainly a beanstalk presence on what was already a thoroughly jumbled block.         Just how this short section of 57th between Broadway and Seventh Avenue became home to so many disparate institutions  the league apartment buildings like the Osborne and car-related businesses like the old General Motors factory at Broadway  is a good question. The architectural mix uncommon in  Manhattan  came about as three distinct kinds of development moved in from three directions.         In 1880 this block was practically terra incognita with just a few miscellaneous structures. Two blocks east the intersection of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue was on its way to becoming a nexus of mansions and 15 blocks south what was still Longacre Square (soon Times Square) had emerged as a center for carriage manufacture.         Broadway below 42nd Street had been a favored address for hotels and their cousins apartment hotels. Beginning in the mid-1870s such buildings also came to Longacre Square; then in the late 1870s apartment-house development for some reason jumped to Seventh Avenue with projects like the 1879   Van Corlear  built from 55th to 56th Street by Edward Clark as a run-up to his Dakota of 1884.         The building long gone was from the outside a harsh sweep of red brick resembling a particularly punitive home for fallen women. But the interior was advanced for its time with cross-ventilation foyer-centered entrances and well-thought-out sleeping entertaining and service areas.         Within a few years the  Wyoming  the Ontiora and other apartment houses also rose on Seventh and ultimately the stone-dealer Thomas Osborne decided to try his hand at this new type of multiple dwelling. His 1885  Osborne  a veritable brownstone quarry of 14 floors at the northwest corner of 57th was one of the biggest of the crop.         The seed of innovation does not always find fertile ground and The Real Estate Record and Guide saw nothing architecturally interesting about Osbornes effort. A further slap in the face came when Osborne lost his vertical advertisement through foreclosure. However it was the first of several apartment-house place markers on this block of 57th Street including the Rodin Studios on the southwest corner of Seventh as well as others nearby like the  Alwyn Court  at 58th Street.         A second thread of development arrived in 1892 when the American Fine Arts Society built 215 West 57th the structure now known as the Art Students League. The society was a consortium of art organizations that banded together in 1889 and in moving to this block extended a line of ateliers on West 57th Street like the Rembrandt and Sherwood Studios and also Carnegie Hall begun at Seventh and 57th in 1889.         A relation of the societys was the lacy Gothic American Society of Civil Engineers at 220 West 57th Street built in 1897 and occupied for years by Lees Art Shop which has preserved many of the interior details.         The final part of the transformation was the northward movement of the carriage operations of Longacre Square along Broadway. This was first felt in 1902 at midblock next to the Art Students League with Frank Goulds colossal banklike indoor riding ring long ago demolished.          Peerless and Demarest  builders of horse-drawn and motorized vehicles followed and by 1910 had erected their Gothic-style white terra-cotta factory and showroom  later owned by General Motors  at the southeast corner of Broadway and 57th. At the northeast corner Fiat took over a four-level store and showroom.         Almost simultaneously the Chicago architect Howard Van Doren Shaw designed a building with an unusual double facade for the L-shaped plot fronting on both Broadway and 57th.         By this time the block had just a few available plots including one at No. 218 on the south side for which in 1916 Consolidated Gas had Warren & Wetmore design its three-story limestone showroom. Although a commercial enterprise the building certainly had a civic grandeur. It was torn down years ago.         In the 1990s the Art Students League declined two offers to build a tall building over its rear parcel. But the offer of $20 million for its air rights from Extell Development was persuasive and now plans call for the league building to have a skinny pencil-case tower cantilevered overhead.         The Extell project would not be possible without the commissions astonishing move of making a landmark of the Broadway frontage of the Shaw building while leaving the 57th Street bay essentially identical to the one on Broadway up for grabs. And grabbed it the developer has; the site is now cleared.         We have then a New York block a sort of architectural loom on which three distinct strands coming from three directions were woven into a single fabric  where from now on it appears the only place to go may be straight up.

394,100000002537013,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Long Island Bakeries Prepare for Holiday Pie Demand,SUSAN M. NOVICK,882,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/nyregion/long-island-bakeries-prepare-for-holiday-pie-demand.html,10,When George Zulkofske stepped into the kitchen at the Jericho Cider Mill on a recent afternoon a cook was folding several pounds of peeled sliced apples into a big bowl that contained a drift of cinnamon and light brown sugar. Twenty apple pies were browning in a large oven.         What a smell. Too bad you cant bottle that up Mr. Zulkofske said. He is the owner of the Jericho Cider Mill a family business that dates to 1938. In addition to the mills sweet apple cider Mr. Zulkofske 79 has been selling apple crumb pies based on his mothers recipe since 1978 using different apple varieties as they ripen progressively through the season.         Now were using  Ida Red  all the way through Thanksgiving he said. Its got sweet and tart and texture he said.         As busy as the kitchen was it will soon get even busier. In the days before Thanksgiving local bakeries typically produce thousands of pies in marathon sessions that sometimes go all day and well into the night. Many of the pies hew closely to fall harvest traditions: double-crusted apple pie and pumpkin for traditionalists; pecan and mincemeat for outliers as well as an apple crisp with a crust on the bottom and a crumble on top.         Although the owners of the Jericho Cider Mill Dianes Bakery  Youngs Farm   Briermere Farm  and  Loafers Bakery  and Gourmet Shoppe recommend that customers place their orders ahead of time to guarantee a Thanksgiving pie of choice  deadlines vary  they usually make a few pies available for walk-ins first come first served.         We are pretty much here around the clock during the holiday week said John Durkin 61 the co-owner with Diane Margaritis 65 of  Trattoria Diane  and Dianes Bakery and Cafe in Roslyn.         Weve got guys peeling apples everywhere Mr. Durkin said.         I always tell my customers to just say its homemade because it pretty much is he added.         On a recent morning 10 cases of local apples had been delivered by pickup truck to the bakery kitchen yielding picturesque double-crusted hand-crimped apple pies; apple cobblers laced with bourbon and brown sugar; and elegant glazed apple tarts.         Roasted Long Island cheese pumpkins provide the purÃ©e for Dianes pumpkin pies available from two weeks before Thanksgiving until mid-December. Thanksgiving isnt Thanksgiving without a pie Ms. Margaritis said.         At Briermere Farm in Riverhead and Youngs Farm in Old Brookville the  cheese pumpkins  are harvested straight from the farm stands backyards. Briermeres pie balances the pumpkin with a bit of homegrown Hubbard squash.         My favorite pie is whatever is fresh said Clark McCombe 55 who owns Briermere with his brothers Philip and Michael. The farm has been family-owned since 1961. In November its a pumpkin pie. And if youre looking for the ultimate apple pie Thanksgiving is the time to do it.         Briermeres apple pie apple crisp and pumpkin pie are holiday best sellers although the fruit cream pies also have their fans. Most of the fruit is grown on the farm and the family recipes are all made from scratch.         On the day before Thanksgiving the line at the bakery can appear daunting Mr. McCombe said but it moves along well. Well still be baking on Thanksgiving morning trying to make sure that everyone gets their Thanksgiving pie he said.         At Youngs Farm the pumpkin pie rivals the apple crisp for the most popular pie of the season. Paula Youngs Weir 62 co-owner of the farm which has been in her family since 1892 acknowledged that pumpkin pie may be an acquired taste but she said If people dont like pumpkin pie then they never had a good one.         More than 4000 pies are sold at Youngs Farm in the two days before Thanksgiving. With limited oven space Ms. Weir sells Youngs double-crusted apple pies then only in frozen unbaked form (although apple crisp and all other pies are sold baked). The unbaked pies come with instructions and customers can put them in the oven for an hour on Thanksgiving Day making the house smell good she said. Sugarless apple and sugarless bumbleberry pies (made with apples and three types of berries) can be ordered in advance.         Youngs Farm also offers among many other choices a mincemeat pie using a traditional recipe of ground chicken apples cider raisins cinnamon butter and brandy. Although its popularity has steadily diminished Ms. Weir said it is still her husbands favorite so she makes it every year.         Most families order the same traditional pies year after year said Lauren Foley 47 a co-owner of Loafers Bakery and Gourmet Shoppe in Locust Valley. People know exactly what they want and what their flavors are she said. In addition to classic apple apple crumb pumpkin cherry and pecan pies Ms. Foley offers the harvest pie a hearty mix of apples cranberries apricots nuts currants raisins and brandy. People who want to be more adventurous go for it because it brings in all the flavors of the season she said.         At her own holiday table where she is expecting 20 to 25 family members Ms. Foley has discovered that everyone has an individual preference so she ends up with at least nine different pies like a pie buffet she said adding Its a good thing I own a bakery.          

LEVY,1519,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/fashion/After-a-Parents-Death-a-Rush-of-Change-modern-love.html,6,When my father died six months shy of his 83rd birthday and my 42nd I was shocked to find that in the midst of grief one clear desire emerged uncontestable: I wanted a child. This was not a decision or even really a thought; it was more like a reflex.         I was sure of two things growing up: that I adored my parents and that I never wanted to have children. Like the writers I most admired I wanted my legacy to be literary not genetic.         I had a vague notion that like Cary Grant I might get around to having a child in my 60s. When a few writer friends began to have children in their 30s I felt vague pity as if they had admitted to something I refused: that my one life was not enough.         Twenty years ago a friend was so devastated by grief after her mother died that she fell into heroin addiction. Id felt for her but I had not understood the depth of her sorrow the disorienting nature of loss.         Now I did. Like her I was frantic with pain desperate to give my life the slip. She became an addict; I would become heterosexual which seemed an equally outlandish choice each of us seeking to escape who we had been.         I had been a lesbian my whole adult life happily involved with women. But three months after my fathers death I started dating a man for the first time in almost 20 years. My friend Marcela asked if this was about having a child. It seemed a ruthless question but I couldnt deny it. Much as I dislike the reduction of love and desire to biology a mechanical rather than a richly intellectual matter my interest in men felt impersonal hormonal a little nuts.         I wondered if this desire would pass with grief; I hoped it would.         Ive often thought our life clocks are set by the age at which our parents bore us: my father was past 40 when I was born my mother approaching that age. So it seemed fitting that in my 40s I would consider the question of children.         I used to tell people how wonderful it was to come to things late in life like all the books I hadnt read in childhood when I preferred the tidier realm of math. Discovering Austen Eliot Woolf and Cheever at 25 was a revelation like watching all the lights come on. (I fell for books when I fell for women.)         Before then books had bored me. They seemed such a lie against experience; no one led such shapely lives. But now I understood that was the point. The artifice revealed truth.         But discovering late what you long for can be heartbreaking as any woman over 40 learns when she finds that pregnancy is a long shot. It didnt matter that people mistook my age that I looked younger than my years. Biology brooked no argument.         After 40 a pregnancy is considered geriatric a nurse told me during a brief bout of in-vitro fertilization that I tried the summer after my father died. By 43 the chance of pregnancy by I.V.F. was less than 3 percent; by 45 it would be near zero.         It did not matter that while working in Brazil the autumn after my fathers death I visited a priestess of candomble an Afro-Brazilian religion who saw a child in my future. She cast buzios (small cowrie shells) and read the auguries. When I asked about the prospect of marrying the man I was dating then  an obsessive destructive marvelously distracting affair  she said You could marry him but it will not make you happy. (This was not news.)         When I asked about marrying my ex-girlfriend who was my best friend she said No!         Disconsolate I asked her what my future held.         You will meet another and will marry and have a child she said. But it will take a very long time.         The priestess looked ancient ageless somewhere between 50 and 75. Her handsome young assistant looked up at me skeptically I thought as did the priestess. None of us believed I had that time.         Eventually the grief did pass after utterly upending my life  prompting me to leave a job a city a relationship a way of life  but my desire for a child did not pass. If my first love affair with a man in 20 years seemed in retrospect artificial and absurd it also (like fiction) revealed something true. I wanted to love; I wanted a child. My one beautiful life no longer seemed enough.         When I met the man I would marry I didnt bring up wanting a child. There seemed no point. I was 47. It was too late.         So I was surprised when he said early on in one of our long rambling phone conversations Id like to give you a child.         I laughed at the presumption even as I was touched.         Im not sure its up to you I said.         We hadnt slept together; I wasnt sure we ever would. I was both charmed and appalled by his presumption that his virility was the decisive factor not my age.         But his confidence was contagious. Gave me hope.         E. J. Levy a writer in Loveland Colo. is the author of the story collection Love In Theory.        Also in Video »

I am about to become his legal guardian. I never married or had biological children so this is probably the only official family event I will have in my life. I have gone to countless weddings showers brises christenings  you name it  and have given generously and happily to my friends. If my family hosts a celebration for the guardianship would it be wrong to strongly hint that equivalent big occasion gifts are welcome?     Pam Manhattan   Depending on how your son feels about your soon-to-be-formalized relationship (I wont use the legal terms guardian and ward theyre way too Oliver Twisty) a party sounds terrific. Just be careful of the boys feelings. You probably know better than the rest of us that your guardianship comes at the loss of his biological parents. Still I hope that nine years of love and support have made him as glad for you as you are for him. That is something to celebrate.         But the crux of your question is about loot. Do not give a party for gifts or hint about them strongly or otherwise. It is mercenary and cheapens the true cause for celebration. (This is equally true of weddings and births.) If you or your son needs something that you cant afford like a wafer-thin tablet or math tutor mention it to a close friend and she can pass the word.         Of course Diana Ross had a point in Its My Turn when she sang This times just for me. But she wasnt referring to those gift-registry guns you see in romantic comedies. Many of us go without elaborate weddings or biological children and lead rich lives (for which our friends are probably deeply grateful). So be the good mother you are and put tit-for-tat china patterns right out of your head.          Graduate Thesis    I am a recent college graduate. At my parents suggestion I contacted a much older family friend about a job. I am interested in a field where he is held in high regard. He agreed to write a letter of recommendation but said he needed to meet with me a few times. At our first meeting he made a blatant pass. I was embarrassed and left abruptly. Later he let me know he would write the letter but made no mention of what had transpired. Im torn: Ill feel like a whore if I take his help but if I dont my parents will ask questions. What should I do?    Anonymous   Its stomach-turning when people try to use power to their advantage but it happens every day. So lets get real. The family friend was always going to write the letter pass or no pass. Thats the way family friends work. And being a whore in this case would involve a great deal more than suffering an unwanted advance. Why punish yourself? If we only took recommendations from saints we wouldnt have many to show our prospective employers.         Its a tough job market out there. And though the old guy was way off-base he wasnt your boss and didnt condition his letter on your responding to his pass either. If his name will open a few doors for you let him knock. You dont have to see him again. (In fact make sure that you dont.)          Just Asking    My fiancÃ©e and I are getting married after living together for three years. We received an R.S.V.P. from a childhood friend of my mother. She is attending but added a note that said my fiancÃ©e and I might enjoy our wedding night more if we spent time apart before the wedding. I found this presumptuous and tacky especially considering that I see this woman once a year at most and my fiancÃ©e has never met her. Should we respond or let this roll off our backs?    Seth Durham N.C.   Let the rolling begin. The woman should never have written her note but she seems pretty irrelevant in your lives. Why write a snippy letter? Whats more her idea is not bad for creating some wedding magic (and not merely of the recovered chastity variety). My larger concern is with your wedding guest list. I know that parents of the bridal couple are a powerful (and well-funded) lobby but why invite strangers to your big day? Have you considered that this womans note was a cagey stunt to get herself uninvited from the hitching of two souls she barely knows?          Brand X    My friend and I disagree about how specifically to request a drink in a private home. He thinks its fine to say: Dewars on the rocks or Tanqueray martini. I believe the request should be more generic: scotch or gin. What do you think?    Maggie New York   You mean other than the fact that I have some serious shopping to do before I invite your pal to drinks at my place? Dont order by name brand in private homes. If your host has two vodkas he will offer you a choice. Otherwise you create a needless bummer by asking for something he cant provide.

I dont know if it helps you or anyone to delay that assessment so I wont. Jonathan Miles can write and here hes written a wonderful book and theres no one I would not urge to read it.         I didnt read Miless first novel Dear American Airlines. I probably should have. But Richard Russo said a good deal of complimentary things about it in these pages and he knows a lot more about life and writing than I do so that should suffice. My guess given that Dear American Airlines was Miless first book and Want Not is his second is that he has gotten better. This is the work of a fluid confident and profoundly talented writer who gets more fluid more confident and seemingly more talented even within the book itself. As it progresses Want Not so assuredly accumulates power and profundity and momentum that I read the last 200 pages without pause.         But Ill admit I wasnt sure at first. For a while I wondered if I was reading about people who did not and could not exist. Because Want Not has a message  it is about waste decay and a world where most things are thrown away soon after theyre made  there was a danger the characters would be  types  instead of  people .         Take Talmadge Bertrand who initially seems to be the hero and whom we first see sifting through garbage on a snowy day in Manhattan. Talmadge comes from money attended Ole Miss joined a fraternity listened to Widespread Panic and smoked a lot of pot. Now he wears his hair like Jesus has a purple star tattoo on his temple (which the tattoo artist . . . told him signified celestial longing) and spends his days Dumpster-diving for lifes essentials. On this particular day searching for edible food he accidentally retrieves a used condom. And though a nearby homeless man mocks him Talmadge sees it as emblematic evidence that we were gnawing the planet alive all of us that the entire mass-produce mass-dispose system was like some terrible endgame buffalo hunt a horror show of unpicked carcasses and that  this   this tube of driveled semen flicked mindlessly onto food enough to feed a family  was Exhibit A an ideal example of our blindness of our pampered disregard and twisted self-indulgence of the great unconsidered  flush  that defined civilization.         Talmadge returns with his findings to his girlfriend Micah in the abandoned building where theyve squatted for six months. Like Talmadge Micah at first seems an easy caricature. She wears dreads has copious tattoos wears a tank top and a flowy white skirt. But unlike Talmadge she did not grow up with privilege. She was raised in Appalachia with nothing at all and the more we know about her the more we realize shes the real purist the stronger mind the force behind their ideology and lifestyle. And we realize Talmadge wants to be near Micah  near the strength of her personality and the certainty of her ideals  more than he wants to eat thrown-away vegetables. Though they have nothing Talmadge and Micah are happy. They eat free and pay no rent their lifes soundtrack a song of New York City you can hear only once and only as young lovers. But soon Talmadges college buddy Matty enters the frame squatting indefinitely in their squat stirring up trouble  the serpent in their end-of-the-world Eden.         The next chapter introduces Elwin Cross Jr. a professor of linguistics at Marasmus State College   applied  linguistics he might note for he wants his field to be useful. Hes in his 50s directionless nearing a point in his life when what  is  becomes what  was  and all the other verbs defining your existence go slumping into the preterite crusted with apophonic alternations (I  sing  calcifying into I  sang ). Hes also morbidly obese and despondent that his wife has recently left him for a professional chef.         One night driving through New Jersey Elwin hits a deer. Surprising himself he decides to take the body home. A sometime hunter in his youth Elwin thinks he can make something of this senseless death. His neighbors 22-year-old son  an abused kid in desperate need of mercy  helps cut the deer into steaks and roasts and amid the gore of this roadkill the two create food and some kind of bond the thrown-away son finding validation with the thrown-away husband.         Then theres the family of Sara Dave and Alexis. Sara who once harbored dreams of acting lost her bond broker husband in the World Trade Center attacks when their daughter Alexis was 11 and has since married Dave  a thuggish debt collector who bullies people into paying ancient credit card bills. Its a scavengers life sure but a step up from his fathers work: how could it be Dave wonders that the son of a turnpike toll collector acquires and assetizes acquires and assetizes marries a hot widowed actress who knows the correct way to pronounce Bulgari then sets her up in a 4400-square-foot house with a three-car garage and a swimming pool and the builders top-of-the-line Brazilian hardwood option?         Dave and Sara are super-consumers seemingly hopeless in their superficiality  Dave of course happy to pay for Saras breast implants  and Alexis now a surly teenager wants none of it. She pines for her dead father deeming him a hero and a saint thinking her life would be far better with him than with her current bourgie situation. But her father was more complicated than she knows and so she soon learns are her mother and even her stepdad.         O.K. but how does Miles tie together all these disparate stories? An abandoned professor of dead languages his neighbors wayward son a young couple living off the grid and off the detritus of super-consumers like Sara and Dave? And then Alexis. And Elwins dying father. And Matty. It seems too much too many and for a long while Miles does little to unite them. He alternates among the various stories and back stories for what seems a perilously long time until we begin to wonder if were heading for some tidy and unconvincing  deus ex machina  in the last few pages.         But somewhere in the middle of the book Miles does something extraordinary. He goes deep very deep with each of them especially Micah and the novel comes alive. We follow Micah back to a revelatory trip to India to her strange and idyllic upbringing in Appalachia and Micah emerges as the most fascinating person  not type not character  in the book. In a similar vein Sara and Dave are made fully real without undergoing any fundamental lifestyle change and Alexis grapples with a personal apocalypse we hope she can turn into some kind of salvation. Even sad-sack Elwin is given hope in the present tense.         That hope oddly enough comes from an assignment that makes his interest in dying languages grimly useful. Hes brought to the New Mexican desert to a terrifying underground crypt where the countrys most radioactive waste will be stored and told that he and a team of engineers and artists are to come up with a way to warn future generations (or interplanetary settlers) of the untouchable danger beneath. This is the Waste Isolation Project Markers and it gives Miles a way of talking about deep time the end of time the future and history and purpose of humankind why we throw away or destroy just about everything we love  and whether we can or should be saved. Miles seamlessly covers all this with an admirably deft touch and in a book that also features frat guys Dumpster-diving and a Yankees game. How does he do it? As I said the man can write.         This is a novel that could have been buried under the weight of its various themes and archetypes and reading it could have been a chore. But its a joyous book a very funny book and an unpredictable book and thats because everyone in it is allowed to be fully human. By the end we get Miless message very clearly and its not about recycling. Its that no one can be thrown away. Not the bond trader. Not the collection agency guy. Not the habitual shopper. Not the squatters the environmental sinners or any baby brought into such a crowded and flawed world. As terrible as we can be we belong here and we matter and we might even do some good. This in the end  and by that I mean the planetary end  might be the most inconvenient truth of all.         Dave Eggers is the author of many books the most recent of which is The Circle.

Here Ill use it in a sentence for you: Santorum had been turfed out of office in 2006 losing his re-election bid by a chasmal 18-point margin. According to Merriam Webster it is indeed a word meaning Â­resembling a chasm. In other words Santorum got beaten badly. But why use other words when chasmal is available?         How about suasive as in: Romney was aware of how jaundiced Stevens was about Christie  which made Stuarts advocacy for choosing the guy as V.P. all the more suasive? From the context it must mean the same as persuasive and you do save three characters if youre short on space.         O.K. but how about acuminate? Or Â­appetent? Or pyretic? Or hoggery and noisomeness or coriaceous or vomitous or freneticism? Make sure to have a Scrabble dictionary nearby when you read Double Down Mark Halperin and John Heilemanns hot new book on the 2012 presidential election. Theres nothing wrong with fancy words if they help to refine your meaning. In the hands of Halperin and Heilemann though they have the opposite effect. Being frenetic is a form of behavior; freneticism sounds like a philosophy of life or type of yoga.         There is actually no vomit in the scene the authors describe as vomitous. Its just their way of writing vividly. Theyre not snobs. They actually have a weakness for colorful vernacular with a special fondness for a particular bodily function. And its not the usual one. The many references to excrement  people serving it to one another on a bun people burying one another in it and so on  are . . . are . . . help me I need a word here. Well theyre vomitous. This may be the first political book ever with more excrement than sex.         They are fond of retrograde (old-Â­fashioned) or simply odd similes and metaphors. For Senator John McCain to endorse Romney would have seemed as likely as a terrier reciting Tennyson. The economic adviser Gene Sperling was enamored of his work in the way that Dean Martin enjoyed martinis. And alliteration: McCains endorsement was based on a mixture of caprice calculation and comparative chagrin. President Obama and Vice President Biden developed a personal peachiness (i.e. they liked each other) after starting out as chalk and Camembert (i.e. they didnt like each other). The usual expression is chalk and cheese  I dont know what that Camembert is about. Romney didnt like the Huntsman family and the Huntsmans vice versad the vitriol. But the authors dont always get it precisely right. Major-domo means a servant or butler  not as they seem to think a bigshot muckety-muck.         George Bush the Elder and the Younger refer to themselves as 41 and 43. But do Clinton and Obama refer to themselves as 42 and 44? And do people really call the Oval Office the Oval for short? That is how Halperin and Heilemann refer to them and their workplace. Obama is POTUS. The first lady is FLOTUS. Obamas campaign staff is referred to as the Obamans or Obamaworld or bizarrely Chicago (where the campaign headquarters were). Romneys entourage is Romneyworld or Boston. Romney himself is the Bay Stater. When Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey enters the drama he and his staff are referred to as Trenton. Its like Shakespeare (in this sense only)  the merging of the nobleman and his seat: Lancaster Norfolk and so on.         Unlike cities states are almost never referred to by name. Its not Pennsylvania its the Keystone State. Its not South Carolina its the Palmetto State and so on. Senator Harry Reid is the Nevadan. Does anyone other than the authors of this book call former Senator Rick Santorum Santo?         Michael Kinsley is editor at large of The New Republic.

Im a plain ordinary guy from Omaha Nebraska. Just an old-fashioned everyday Middle Westerner.. . . But youre streamlined. Youre today. Sister I was raised amongst the grasshoppers I am strictly from corn. And then the duo breaks into song and dance which is where Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercers sublime ballad Im Old Fashioned debuted.         For me the song and the drink (which predates it by a very long time; the name dates to around the 1880s but the recipes essentials go back to at least 1806) go together perfectly. And even Astaires brief speech seems to telegraph the big question among old-fashioned drinkers: Which way are you going to have it  streamlined or strictly from corn?         No cocktail (and this includes the martini) gets people as worked up about methodology as the old-fashioned. And thats probably because the two major approaches really are quite different. One is starkly minimalist prescribing nothing more than sugar whiskey and bitters   maybe  a few teardrops worth of water  maybe  a twist of orange or lemon to finish it off. Like Hayworth its streamlined its today (even if it is one of the oldest cocktails on record). Its certainly not the old-fashioned I was taught to make at a bar in small-town Vermont in the early 1990s. There the first time a customer ordered the drink from me I skulked over to the manager to ask what to do. She plonked a sugar cube a slice of orange and a cherry in a glass dug what looked like a small nightstick out of a drawer handed it to me as if I had any idea what to do with it and told me to add whiskey Angostura bitters and ice. I did figure out what to do with the muddler and that drink  the sweet and fruity eager-to-please raised among the grasshoppers strictly from corn boisterous version  instantly became my old-fashioned.         I wouldnt encounter its austere twin for more than a decade at an East Village bar where at the time I assumed they had just run out of fruit. But as more years piled on I noticed that this version had ascended. It had become to many the one the true the correct way to drink it. I get it. Its a lovely restrained drink so pared-down as to feel elemental. But I like the other more gregarious kind too. And ultimately what Ive discovered I like best of all is essentially a hybrid  like the version from Kenneth McCoy a bartender and owner at Ward III in TriBeCa ( see recipe ). At his dads bar in Manhattan they were made much as I was taught to in Vermont and affection for that fruit-forward flavor abides with a little adjusting.         After all this years fancies the song tells us are passing fancies.                Also in Video »

401,100000002537299,0,Article,Review,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,A Portrait of Eternally Beguiling Americana,MICHAEL SOMMERS,663,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/nyregion/a-review-of-our-town-at-the-shakespeare-theater-of-new-jersey.html,11,During the two intermissions of a recent performance of  Our Town  at the  Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey  I overheard a number of older patrons remark that they had never before seen it. That was a bit surprising because this great enduring play by  Thornton Wilder  has been staged countless times since its 1938 premiere in Princeton.         It must be lovely to discover the cosmic wonders of Our Town for the first time. It certainly is lovely to encounter the play again in such a beautiful production as the one in Madison.         The artful simplicity of Wilders prose and structure in creating a microcosm of a New Hampshire village of the early 1900s remains remarkable and beguiling. As the playwright positions the town of Grovers Corners and its mundane individuals against the vast context of endless time and a boundless universe his drama celebrates both the marvel of everyday existence and the something way down deep thats eternal about every human being.         That last observation is made by the character known as the Stage Manager an omniscient figure who is in charge of the action and comments upon it. He is confidently played here by the lean silver-haired Philip Goodwin with a dry Yankee twang and a mostly cool sense of composure that occasionally turns fierce during the plays bleaker passages. Mr. Goodwins vibrant presence enables the easy flow of the production which has been sensitively directed with infinite attention to detail by Joseph Discher.         Our Town is generally known as a work that is meant to be presented in a theater with very little scenery. Yet Mr. Discher employs a good deal of smart stagecraft in realizing this incarnation of Grovers Corners. The audience still uses its imagination to complete the visuals as the author intended but the designers lend ample assistance.         Charlie Calvert the scenic designer provides a square wooden proscenium that frames a modest thrust stage and the handsome back wall of an old-fashioned theater built of dusky red brick. The tables and chairs used by the actors to represent places including a drugstore a church and a cemetery have been carefully selected to be authentic to the region and the period.         Using footlights and extensive side-lighting Matthew Adelsons design is sculptural and often exquisite. The brightening dawn as the first act begins and the deep blue and white moonlight that concludes it are nearly distracting in their beauty. The director and designer clearly intend to evoke the charms of nature that people sometimes fail to appreciate in their own surroundings.         Aptly dressed in vintage clothes by Candida Nichols the 19-member company led by Mr. Goodwins forthright Stage Manager gives a vivid sense of life to the characters.         The nice next-door neighbors Emily Webb and George Gibbs whose courtship and wedding form the heart of the drama are ardently portrayed by Nisi Sturgis and Jordan Coughtry. Their sweet spontaneity in the scene where Emily and George sip strawberry ice cream sodas as they realize their love for each other produces a wealth of feelings in what might appear to be a mere Norman Rockwell idyll. Radiant within the darkness of the third act Ms. Sturgiss tearful interpretation of Emilys goodbye to the world is very moving.         Mr. Discher has drawn similarly fine work from the other leading players. Warmly depicting Georges mother Marion Adler is a peppery Mrs. Gibbs opposite his father a hale Dr. Gibbs played by Malachy Cleary. Rebecca Gray Davis is delightful as Georges smart little sister. The bond between Emily and her parents seems especially close. Allison Daughertys Mrs. Webb wears spectacles and a matter-of-fact attitude that she shares with James Michael Reillys quietly wry Mr. Webb. Mark H. Dold offers a sharply cut cameo as the towns tippling choirmaster.         Our Town presents a long-gone way of American life yet the eternal verities it embraces are as touching as ever. It is a pleasure to see the play given as thoughtful a staging as this one.         Our Town by Thornton Wilder runs through Nov. 17 at the F. M. Kirby Shakespeare Theater 36 Madison Avenue Madison. Information: (973) 408-5600 or  shakespearenj.org .        Also in Video »

Facing an empty nest she asked for a trial separation. In hindsight both would have done things very differently.          Marriage:  In 1974 they began living together and married in 1976. They divorced in 2004 after 28 years.          Age when married:  He: 26. She: 27.          Occupation:  She is a senior lecturer in English and ethnic studies at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. He is a management consultant in the health industry in a business partnership with her brother.          Children : Three. She had a 3-year-old son now 44 from a previous marriage when they met. Together: a son now 36 and a daughter 32. Now they have five grandchildren.          Where did they grow up?   She grew up in a close loving Milwaukee family. He in a rural California town in a family that was not close or demonstrative. His father owned a truck stop and several small businesses. Work was the most important thing in my fathers life Mr. Petty said. He slept every other night.          Where did they meet?   In 1972 they met in Northern California at a self-help center where both were exploring a spiritual movement that was popular then.          What was it about the other?   Arlene: He was handsome and smart. I was seeking answers to the social and personal problems of the time and he was too.         Ed: Shes a great communicator kind smart and giving. For me it was fairly simple: she really loved me and we had great chemistry.          Reasons for marrying?   A shared dedication to fixing the ills of the world which were being addressed by the self-help peace and antiwar movements.         Arlene: I had never been in love like that before. Also he was a good father to her son. Both wanted more children.         Ed: Arlene had a strong sense of family and I admired that. My childhood home was like being in the wild West: my father tipped his hat at me maybe he shook my hand.          First signs of trouble?   Nine years in faced with financial problems they moved from California to her hometown of Milwaukee. He started a business with her brother and traveled for work sometimes two weeks a month which strained the relationship.         Arlene: Felt he worked too much on the road and also at home. Wanted him to connect more with the children to know details of their lives. She gave up working to be a stay-at-home mother and felt jealous of his freedom to have a career and everything handled at home.         This division of labor was the best we could come up with and yet I felt somewhat trapped inside these roles and sometimes resented it.         Ed: Admits to being more focused on work and on social change than on their children. Im not a natural workaholic but we were always in a financial struggle. Working for myself meant more than working 9 to 5. There was never enough time to get our romance on.          What pushed them apart?   Arlene: When their last child left for college the glue that kept them together seemed to dissolve. Studying for a Ph.D. she felt increasing discontent. In 2001 she asked for a trial separation.         Ed: Felt she always wanted more connection and romance. His resentment about being criticized was growing. They talked about the separation being temporary but when it happened he was devastated.         During their first year of separation they tried to reconcile several times but also dated other people.          Did they try therapy?   Arlene: Yes they worked on improving communication. He liked her the way she was and believed he was being accused of being the reason the relationship wasnt working. In individual therapy she saw that her expectations of him were not realistic. Instead of accepting the love he offered I kept trying to get this deeper connection from him.         Ed: The first therapist was a complete loser; he found another for them together and one for himself. I dont think any of them nailed me or her. I felt like I was running our sessions.          The final breakup:   Ed: He lost romantic feelings for her. Im monogamous. I couldnt be intimate with her after all that happened. A year later he met someone new and fell in love.         Arlene: I thought Ed would be in love with me forever that he wouldnt find anyone for him better than me. The new girlfriend she thought didnt want to change him.          How did they feel?   Ed: Terrible  despite the new relationship.         Arlene: Freedom at first. Dating was less enjoyable than she had imagined.

403,100000002534498,0,Article,News,Real Estate,realestate,,"‘Qualified’ Loans, Redefined",LISA PREVOST,606,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/realestate/qualified-loans-redefined.html,10,The mortgage industry is bracing for the coming of Q.M. the new federal rules defining a qualified mortgage  or one underwritten to standards deemed safe for consumers. The implementation of Q.M. poses a compliance headache for lenders though the average borrower is unlikely to notice any difference when the rules take effect in January. The most immediate differences will be felt by borrowers at the higher and lower ends of the income scale.         As part of the lending reforms imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act a qualified mortgage is intended to be less likely to wind up in default. Lenders that meet the Q.M. conditions and underwriting standards are promised protection from legal challenges for those loans.         Among the basic criteria: A Q.M. loan must be fully amortizing with a term no longer than 30 years and the points and fees paid by the borrower cannot exceed 3 percent of the total loan amount.         Lenders must also document the borrowers ability to repay the loan and confirm a debt-to-income ratio of no more than 43 percent. (The ratio represents the percentage of a borrowers monthly gross income used to pay monthly debts.) Loans with a ratio exceeding 43 percent but qualified for purchase by  Fannie Mae  or  Freddie Mac  or for a  Federal Housing Administration  guarantee will still fall under the Q.M. umbrella because of a temporary exemption expected to last at least a few years. Higher-risk mortgages like interest-only and no-doc loans which dont require verification of the borrowers income and assets are ineligible.         For now the Q.M. definition is broad enough that an estimated 95 percent of mortgage loans being made in the current market fit the criteria according to Richard Cordray the director of the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  which is writing the rules. Mr. Cordray cited that figure in  remarks late last month  to the  Mortgage Bankers Association .         For a borrower going in January to get a loan I think its going to be pretty much status quo said Eric Stein a senior vice president of the  Center for Responsible Lending . The kind of loans that people are getting these days qualify directly for Q.M. status so there shouldnt be any impact.         Still credit unions which are known for being more flexible around mortgage lending are wary of the rules effect on their members said Carrie Hunt the senior vice president for government affairs and general counsel of the  National Association of Federal Credit Unions . The organization has requested that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  delay implementation of the rules  because the cost of compliance is proving so burdensome for smaller institutions.         The rule could affect the availability of so-called jumbo loans which because they dont conform with the Fannie and Freddie loan limits would not be considered qualified mortgages if the borrowers debt-to-income ratio exceeded 43 percent.         At the other end of the scale the cap on points and fees could make it harder for lower-income borrowers said Cameron Findlay the chief economist for Discover Home Loans. Those with less-than-perfect credit and higher debt-to-income ratios often wind up in loans with substantial points and fees that could exceed the 3 percent cap he said. These consumers would have to look to a nonqualified mortgage which could be more expensive.         The question is how much lending activity are we going to see emerge around the Q.M. box? said Stan Humphries the chief economist at Zillow.com a real estate information service. If you want to exceed 43 percent D.T.I. but youve got an 850 credit score and you want to put 30 percent down someones going to make you a mortgage for that.

Only two small signs hang outside; one is in Japanese characters and the other says simply sushi. The restaurants spacious 1000-square-foot dining area contains just 22 seats (including six at the sushi bar) with the center of the room occupied by a tree sculpture that appears to be growing through the dropped ceiling.         This limited seating is very typical of Tokyo so that the master chef can prepare everything himself said Jinyi Sekikawa speaking on the phone after my visits. She owns the restaurant along with her husband Makoto Sekikawa who is the executive chef.         Mr. Sekikawa who was born in Japan learned his trade in Tokyo and operated a restaurant also called Norimaki in New York City for 10 years before opening the Washington Depot place in 2010. It has a list of daily specials that includes many items seldom seen in Connecticut.         Some of these  like unagi (freshwater eel flown in live from Japan) and ankimo (monkfish liver)  are so limited in quantity they were unavailable on several visits. Others such as  nagaimo  (mountain potato as it is called on the menu) can be challenging to Western tastes. As pale as an Asian pear and with a similarly crisp granular texture nagaimo sliced into tiny splints and stacked attractively on a shiso leaf is accurately described on Norimakis menu as slimy.         A similar viscosity was displayed by tokobushi (live abalone) partly on account of its juice being incorporated into its soy-based sauce. Its rather tough texture would have been more appealing if it had been sliced even thinner.         More approachable and as supple as warm butter was saikyoyaki (black cod an appetizer special) grilled to moist flakiness and lathered in a sweet miso sauce. A teriyaki seafood starter of a halved scallop four shrimp and a clutch of shimeji mushrooms had a slightly more complex less syrupy sauce. Although the fish verged on overcooked the pale mushrooms  nutty tender delectable  were perfect.         Perfection also describes the kani crab meat rich with lumps and fiber dotted with red tobiko eggs and bound by a mayonnaise-based sauce. Crowning this tasty timbale was a dollop of caviar with semicircles of paper-thin cucumber slices forming a necklace around it. A calamari appetizer lumped in a small bowl lacked the kanis eye appeal but the slivers of squid combined with a tantalizing array of mountain vegetables (traditionally foraged in the wild) seasoned with ginger sesame seeds and sesame oil had a highly pleasing range of flavors and textures.         On the whole Norimakis entrees are far less varied than its appetizers with three of the menus five food pages devoted to sushi. Its regular sashimi and sushi platters accompanied by a fairly standard miso soup are well-prepared if workmanlike. The sashimi  my order had three pieces each of tuna salmon tobiuo (flying fish) and scallop  was garnished with shiso leaf shredded daikon and twigs of cucumber. Tobiuo also appeared on the sushi plate along with a slightly vinegary kibinago (silver-stripe round herring) five other more common fish and a competently made California roll.         Norimaki also has plenty of cooked and vegetarian choices. Una-don an eel fillet broiled in a dark sweet sauce sprinkled with sesame seeds and served over rice was ample but it would have been better had its layer of fat been trimmed. A mixed veggie roll on the other hand elicited no complaints with its combination of avocado cucumber carrot lettuce oshinko (pickled daikon) and a dash of a creamy sauce rolled up in rice and nori (seaweed).         Udon noodle dishes comprise Norimakis other entree options. Handsomely-glazed ceramic bowls are filled with a sweet smoky broth that includes soy and sake and brim with wide flat noodles; toasted bread crumbs and chili powder are added tableside. While the rubbery somewhat bland featured ingredient in fish cake udon may be an acquired taste I was thoroughly taken by the crunchy medley of mountain vegetables in sansai udon.        
405,100000002540274,0,Article,Review,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,The Implications of Ownership,SYLVIANE GOLD,781,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/nyregion/a-review-of-owners-at-yale-repertory-theater.html,10,Its so 70s was the consensus of a group leaving a recent performance of the  Yale Repertory Theater  where  Caryl Churchills   Owners  is giving theatergoers much to discuss on the way home.         They werent quite wrong. The character who keeps trying and failing to kill himself could have arrived straight from a Monty Python sketch; the piles of rancid meat and the casually vicious proprietor of the dingy butcher shop where the play opens carry a distinct whiff of  Joe Orton ; and the plays episodic structure smacks a bit of the periods let it all hang out dramaturgy.         But their consensus wasnt quite right either. The works central character a callous real estate deal maker played with great brio by Brenda Meaney would be right at home in an 80s play by David Mamet; some of the other Londoners in Owners resemble the dark-hearted losers populating 21st-century plays by Adam Rapp and Neil LaBute; and Ms. Churchills acidic critique of capitalist freebooters and the culture that worships them as heroes carries even more resonance today than it did in 1972 when the play opened.         Owners was Ms. Churchills first outing on the London stage and she had yet to achieve the formal mastery that would make later plays like Cloud Nine and Top Girls instant modernist classics. But she already had full command of her voice and her themes and the Yale Rep production directed by Evan Yionoulis adds a bold theatrical touch to lend the play a more adventurous Churchillian style.         Ms. Yionoulis employs mannequins instead of extras in a few early scenes and then freezes the live action at key moments so that the mannequins seem to take over the storytelling. These stagy tableaux underline the artificiality of the proceedings and give Owners some of the stylistic novelty that Ms. Churchill was able to write into her later plays.         Here her main concern was upending not theater conventions but our understanding of the concept of property. Owners explores the social and moral implications of ownership  and not just for the owners. Marion the ruthless broker who buys up cheap buildings forces out the poor tenants and then reaps windfall profits from the upgraded high-end housing believes herself in control of her deals and her wealth. But her husband the struggling butcher Clegg believes just as firmly that he owns her.         As Worsely Marions depressive lieutenant schemes to eject Lisa Alec and their family from a shabby apartment Ms. Churchill shows us the years of overlapping power relationships that have led to this seemingly straightforward (if not exactly savory) business transaction. By the time the play is over a baby has been made an object of barter sexual favors have been traded like commercial paper and multiple murders have been planned and carried out with varying degrees of success.         Although the plot and the writing sometimes suggest farce Ms. Yionouliss approach is more realistic and Carmen Martinezs turntable set and Benjamin Ehrenreichs lighting follow suit. Only Seth Bodies exuberantly fur-trimmed costumes for Marion have the comic bite to match Ms. Meaneys ferocity. Avidly munching on candy bars and whatever else comes to hand and sweeping past the little people in her path Ms. Meaney is pure savagery.         Marions motto is Do what you want. Get what you can. Clegg played with malicious zest by Anthony Cochrane subscribes to it as well pondering various methods of eliminating his wife. Joby         Earles morose Worsely does what hes told not what he wants but occasionally they amount to the same thing. Sarah Mantons Lisa the most vulnerable of the five main characters finds a way to retaliate when shes pushed far enough.         And even Tommy Schriders laid-back Alec who through most of Owners appears to have extinguished all worldly desires eventually reveals hes human after all. (Alex Trow keeps pace with him and the other fine actors in small turns as Alecs decrepit mother and as a downstairs neighbor.)         As her characters seek to satisfy their cravings Ms. Churchill makes us acutely aware that wealth is not the only thing at stake. The language of intimacy is the language of possession: Im yours whether you want me or not Marion says to the man she loves. The language of parenthood is the language of possession: Lisa is going to have a baby but that doesnt mean she will keep the baby.         And while self-possession is generally thought a positive trait Ms. Churchill asks us to consider what it actually means to be self-possessed: Do we own our own lives or do we merely rent them from God the almighty landlord? This is a question that transcends the 70s. And so does Owners.         Owners by Caryl Churchill is at the Yale Repertory Theater 1120 Chapel Street New Haven through Nov. 16.

McFADDEN;RAQUEL CEPEDA;EDWIDGE DANTICAT;COLIN CHANNER;ELIZABETH NUNEZ,3905,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/travel/my-caribbean-5-vignettes.html,8, How do you define the Caribbean? Writers intimately acquainted with the islands answer with postcards from their ancestral homes.    1. BARBADOS   I was just 8 years old when my grandmother announced to my brother and me that she would be taking us to Barbados for the summer.         Where is that? I asked. Her response was in the West Indies but I had no idea where the West Indies was or what type of people inhabited such a place. Did they all look like my grandmother or something else?         I spent most of the hours on the Pan Am flight staring out into the darkness wondering about this foreign land we were traveling to. From my dinner Id saved the dessert a square slice of pineapple spongecake. It would be my offering to the great chief of the West Indians that no doubt would be meeting us at the airport.         After landing we walked out into the warm morning air heavy with scents of sea salt and sugar cane. The sun was just beginning to glow casting a soft light onto the surrounding pastures dotted with grazing cows hogs and goats.         Weeks before our departure my young mind had churned out visions of the West Indies in a dream that placed me shaking and scared in a tepee circled by Indians clutching bows and arrows. But my grandmothers cousins looked nothing like what I had imagined nor did they look like my grandmother; they were short and stout in stature similar to the women depicted in Boteros paintings.         They embraced me but I did not drop my guard no matter how wonderful their fat arms felt wrapped around my slim body. I presented them with my gift and they giggled.         My brother and I slid across the broad leather seat of a 1956 Fairlane as it sped down unpaved roads that snaked through hollowed-out mountains dripping with pink and white bougainvillea. The vast unbelievably blue Caribbean was always to our left bucking with exultation as the sun slipped over the horizon and sprinkled it with shimmering rays of confetti.         Their home was in Paynes Bay St. James an area known as the Gold Coast. They lived in a small brown and beige chattel house that rested on a foundation of quarry and sea stones. It shook and shivered when we walked across the thin wooden floor.         My first meal in that strange land was steamed fish and a molehill of something that looked like mashed potatoes but was buttery in color made of cornmeal and okra.         What is this?         Barbados national dish flying fish and coo-coo.         Flying fish? Fish with wings?         I was intrigued.         In the weeks that followed I became comfortable with barefoot living and the green lizards that watched me curiously from the windowsills and walls. I looked forward to dusk as I had become fascinated by the ruby-colored soldier crabs that climbed from earthen holes to begin their nightly scavenge for food. In Brooklyn stars were scarce but in Barbados the night sky was littered with them.         Our playground was the sea and most of our days were spent frolicking in it. We were thrilled when the Jolly Rogers a party cruise boat entered our playground waters. The soca and calypso music sailed our way and we would bump grind and gyrate in the wuk-up style of dance that has come to be known as twerking  but has ancient African roots.         Every day I thought about the flying fish and secretly watched for them in the emerald-colored canopy of the breadfruit trees.         As the end of the summer approached I promised myself that I would return again and again. Forty years later I honor the promise at least once a year.         The day before we were set to return to the states I fell into a deep melancholy because I did not want to leave and I had not caught a glimpse of the elusive flying fish. I was swimming and the sun was just beginning to set when my aunt called us children in for dinner.         One last time I screamed in response sucked air into my lungs and dove deeper than I had the entire summer so deep that my ears popped as I surged toward the creamy-colored sand beneath me.         This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 17 2013 A picture caption last Sunday with an article about Jamaica misstated the name of a bar there that was a favorite of the writer.

407,100000002538682,0,Article,Review,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,"Imported From Turkey, a Taste of Home",SCOTT VEALE,706,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/nyregion/a-review-of-lisas-mediterranean-cuisine-in-ridgewood.html,7,For proof of how far hard work and a good attitude can take you in life one could do worse than drop in at  Lisas Mediterranean Cuisine  in downtown Ridgewood.         Lisa is Lisa Mayisoglu who moved to the United States from Ankara in 1985 and opened her first restaurant Lisas Turkish Kitchen seven years ago a few doors away on Chestnut Street. Her husband died a year or so later leaving her with three children to raise and the demands of running her own establishment. Fast forward to 10 months ago when she moved to her current location with Selma Sozen her sister as a new partner and a revamped name intended to attract a wider pool of customers.         Unfortunately they dont know Turkish food which is similar to Greek and other Mediterranean food Ms. Mayisoglu said in a telephone interview after a couple of recent meals. They are hesitant.         Not so during our visits when the place was crowded with casually turned-out couples and family groups eagerly sampling dishes of many shapes sizes and aromas. The largish room is bisected by a row of columns with heavy red drapes between them lending a slightly cozier cast to the tightly spaced tables. The dÃ©cor is simple with plenty of gilded surfaces and one column covered with evil-eye pendants for good luck. The overall effect is pleasantly old-fashioned and relaxing.         Good spirits abound. You might see Lisa herself wandering out from the kitchen to greet guests; youre sure to see Selma who works the front of the room with voluble charm.         The servers zigging and zagging about are engaging and vigilant if occasionally less than helpful with details: When asked about the beans in one of the mixed appetizers our waitress responded with a smile Theyre beans. (They were red beans in a tasty dip called pilaki.) And there may be a bit of a wait between courses. But everyone is sweet-natured which goes a long way to compensate for the few rough spots.         The huge menu is filled with both familiar Mediterranean fare like falafel shish kebabs and spinach pies and lesser-known Turkish dishes. Youll want to start with the peppery sun-dried tomato dip that hits your table with a basket of warm puffy Turkish pita. A satisfying plate of cold appetizers showcased creamy hummus and pasty baba ghanouj; lebni (strained yogurt) laced with spinach dill and garlic; unusually tender homemade grape leaves; and best of all subtly spiced ezme salad with tomatoes peppers cucumbers onions ground walnuts and pomegranate syrup.         Tangy garlic yogurt and Ms. Mayisoglus robust house-made tomato sauce  which turns up in numerous dishes  helped lift the zucchiniÂ pancakes while pacanga boregi pan-fried triangles of flaky dough filled with Turkish pastrami and kashar cheese was intriguing if a tad too cheesy.         The lamb and chicken appearing in many entrees including the generous mixed grill were carefully cooked and seasoned. The gyro lamb used in the Iskender kebabs was especially tender and juicy as were the ground lamb in the adana kebabs and the cubes in the shish kebab.         A plate of manti tiny homemade dumplings with ground lamb and onion steamed and then sautÃ©ed in olive oil and served with garlic yogurt and tomato sauce were light yet flirted with blandness.         The whole branzino on the other hand was outstanding a fleshy specimen simply prepared with olive oil lemon and spices. Another winner was hunkar begendi chunks of seasoned lamb (you can also choose chicken or gyro) with a transporting bÃ©chamel sauce with chopped smoked eggplant and kashar cheese.         Samples of the homemade desserts come around on a platter with plastic wrapping but dont be daunted: They are excellent particularly the baklava  buttery butÂ not overly soaked with honeyÂ   and figs stuffed with walnuts and sesame seeds. Both go well with a tiny cup of the syrupy bitter Turkish coffee.         Its tempting to wonder what might happen if Ms. Mayisoglu pared down her menu and focused on fully articulating the flavors in her best native cooking. But those evil eyes seem to be working their charm: The crowds are coming the atmosphere is welcoming the prices are gentle and the kitchen is turning out quite a few unexpected pleasures.                    Lisas Mediterranean Cuisine   28 Oak Street
408,100000002536202,0,Article,News,Arts,arts,music,Liberating the Librettos,ANTHONY TOMMASINI,1850,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/arts/music/anthony-tommasini-weighs-in-on-opera-what-ifs.html,1,Most opera fans are intensely involved with the characters of great operas. We are protective of them even the evil ones.          There is a lively realm of fan fiction focused on movie and television characters in which viewers share ideas on how some breakup or betrayal might turn out. Opera fans by contrast are fixated on characters who have been around for generations even centuries. The plots of favorite operas have long been cemented in our minds.         Yet we too like to speculate on what happens after the final curtain falls. Several recent books grapple with Puccinis Madama Butterfly imagining what happens to the 3-year-old boy nicknamed Trouble born to the caddish Lieutenant Pinkerton and Cio-Cio San the geisha who commits suicide. Online opera lovers are pretty playful about their fantasies of what might happen in favorite works especially Wagners epic Ring. One wag envisions a fifth installment to the cycle in which the Rhinemaidens fed up after years of devotion and celibacy open a classy brothel where clients must pay for services in gold.         So like many opera fans I have long had strong feelings about what happens to certain characters when the curtain goes down.         Take Rigoletto which on Monday returns to the Met in Michael Mayers production introduced last season. The staging zaps the story from 16th-century Mantua to the Las Vegas Strip during the early 60s. The tenor Matthew Polenzani a house favorite will sing his first Duke at the Met.         In the last moments of the opera as traditionally staged Rigoletto a hunchbacked jester hears the lecherous Duke of Mantua singing in the distance. Rigoletto realizes that the body in the sack he is dragging to the river cannot be the Duke whose assassination he ordered to avenge his daughters honor. To his horror it is his daughter Gilda who in the throes of passion and shame has sacrificed herself for the Duke.         But what happens after the opera ends? Will Rigoletto try again to have the Duke killed? Or kill himself?         Will the Duke continue his life of entitlement and debauchery seducing any woman who intrigues him?         The Duke is a letch without honor and integrity Mr. Polenzani said in an interview when asked to imagine what comes next for his character. He lives solely to satisfy whatever desire he has. When Gilda dies at the end is he sad? No. 1 Im not even certain he would know she is dead. It was a conquest.         If he got with her again he said it would be just because he was feeling randy and she was there.         Now that is one tough assessment. Mr. Polenzani of course can claim insights into the Duke that trump mine. Still I disagree.         Maybe Im a softy but I think the Duke will find out what Gilda did and be shaken by it. He will probably go on womanizing. But future conquests will feel increasingly empty. Gilda will weigh on him. I take my clues from Verdis music. To me it seems impossible that the man who pretending to be a student romances Gilda in such tender phrases is faking it just to have sex.         Another opera Ive been pondering since it returned to the Met this fall is Mozarts CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte the third and last opera he wrote with the librettist Lorenzo da Ponte. The ending of CosÃ¬ is intentionally ambiguous.         To recap the story: A cynical old bachelor Don Alfonso tired of hearing his young officer friends Ferrando and Guglielmo boasting about the faithfulness of their fiancÃ©es challenges them to a wager. The young men will tell their girlfriends that they have been ordered to war and then reappear in exotic disguises to try to seduce each others beloveds.         Alas they succeed; Alfonso is proved right. The men are indignant; the women guilt-ridden. But Alfonso urges the two couples to accept human nature and get married anyway. The libretto however leaves the pairing of partners uncertain. Do the original couples reunite? Or will the women now stay with the men who won them so easily?         These questions were raised with the cast members who recently finished four performances of CosÃ¬ in the Mets revival of  Lesley Koenigs production  conducted triumphantly by  James Levine in his return  to the pit after more than two years away because of health problems. This cast reassembles in April again with Mr. Levine for more performances.         In this production Mr. Polenzani sings Ferrando and the baritone  Rodion Pogossov  is his friend Guglielmo. The soprano  Susanna Phillips  is Fiordiligi who when the opera begins is engaged to Guglielmo; the mezzo-soprano  Isabel Leonard  sings Dorabella Fiordiligis sister who has promised herself to Ferrando.         Natalia V. Osipova contributed reporting.

Lawrence Wrights Going Clear: Scientology Hollywood and the Prison of Belief. Its an examination of one cult religion but can also be read as a primer on the basic cultlike nature of all religions.          Describe your ideal reading experience (when where what how).   I am a very promiscuous reader. Anytime anywhere. But my favorite place to read is in a hot bath late at night with a big glass of ice water.          Who are your favorite novelists?   My favorite novelists and short-story writers are Louise Erdrich Michael Connelly Lorrie Moore James Welch Toni Morrison Dennis Lehane Kelly Link David Markson Mo Hayder Ralph Ellison Leslie Marmon Silko Aimee Bender Jim Carroll and Colin Harrison.

Any new books by Native American authors you would recommend? And your all-time favorite literary works by Native Americans?Â    Stephen Graham Jones a Blackfeet Indian has written tons of sci-fi horror crime and experimental fiction. Hes not new but should certainly be read by many more people. My favorite work of Native American literature is Ceremony by Leslie Marmon Silko.          Who is your favorite overlooked or underappreciated writer?   One of my favorite writers Colin Harrison writes amazing crime novels that arent feted as they should be. The last one I read The Havana Room begins with a peanut-allergy-related death that will rip your heart and guts and lungs out through your belly button.          What kinds of stories are you drawn to? Any you steer clear of?   I tend to read books that feature crime criminals and justice. I stay clear of any book with Native American spirituality in the description.          What books might we be surprised to find on your shelves?   The collected Harold Bloom!          Whats the best book youve ever received as a gift?   The Basketball Diaries by Jim Carroll. My dad gave it to me for my 15th birthday. He thought it was only about basketball.

Did you grow up with a lot of books? What are your memories of being read to as a child?   My father read all the time. Our house was filled with cheap paperbacks. But I dont recall anybody ever reading to me. Instead Id grab a book and read alongside my dad.          Do you have a favorite childhood literary character or hero?Â    Daredevil the Man Without Fear. A blind and very mortal superhero. I pretended he was part Indian.          What writers inspire you?   Im a fanboy vacuum. I inhale everything and find influence in most of it from Shakespeare to Serenity from Jane Austen to Austin City Limits from Native Son to Breaking Bad.          Disappointing overrated just not good: What book did you feel you were supposed to like and didnt? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?   I always have this reflexive animosity toward the new hot writers like Karen Russell or Chad Harbach so I buy their books read the first page and then set them aside for months. Eventually I go back read the books and discover of course that the books are great. Its my literary pathology.          If you could meet any writer dead or alive who would it be? What would you want to know?Â    I would love to go on a first date with Dorothy Parker and get verbally eviscerated.          If you could meet any character from literature who would it be?Â    Bill Denbrough from Stephen Kings It. A brave man who was braver as a boy. And a stutterer like me.          Whats next on your reading list?   Fooling Houdini by Alex Stone. Im a dork about magic.        
410,100000002536409,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,ncaafootball,"Fresno State Loves Its Bulldogs, but So Does a Gang",MALIA WOLLAN,3448,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/sports/ncaafootball/fresno-adopts-its-college-team-but-so-does-a-gang.html,1,FRESNO Calif.  Bulldogs can be seen snarling from flagpoles from baseball caps from T-shirts and from tattoos  one man has the dogs face inked across his torso its behind across his back. Young men on street corners bark at passing patrol officers. They call their children little dogs or bull puppies. Police raids find their targets asleep beneath red blankets emblazoned with the dog.         Fresno and the surrounding region have long been overrun by Bulldogs. And where the violent pack goes trouble follows.         The Fresno State Bulldogs college football team is exceedingly popular here in the countrys fruit and vegetable epicenter where more than a million acres of cropland stretch to the horizon. From Sacramento to L.A. there is nothing except agriculture and Fresno State football said Kenny Wiggins a former Fresno State lineman who plays in the N.F.L. for the San Diego Chargers. We were the only show in town; everyone and I mean everyone goes to the games.         The teams logo is a cartoon bulldog a muscled beast with sharp teeth a spiked collar and floppy ears. But the bulldog is no longer just a college sports mascot. It has been appropriated by members of a savage street gang who call themselves the Bulldogs.         The gang started in a prison and quickly earned a reputation as unusually vicious even in the bloody world of California gangs. At their height in 2006 the Bulldogs were responsible for 70 percent of the citys shootings the police said. Three of four inmates in the county jail are Bulldogs.         They grew and grew and grew until there were Bulldogs everywhere you looked Jerry Dyer Fresnos police chief said.         The mascot now plays a double role as football icon and gang symbol. Confusing the two can have fatal consequences. In 2011 Stephen Maciel a father of four who the police said had no gang affiliation was shot and killed by a Bulldogs gang member in a liquor store parking lot. Maciel was wearing a red Fresno State shirt.         The gangs embrace of the bulldog logo has put university administrators in an excruciatingly awkward position amid a gang crisis that has claimed hundreds of lives. The situation has vexed them even as sales of Fresno State apparel and merchandise increased tenfold since the gang took hold in the city. The university has considered dropping the logo and has approached law enforcement officials for guidance.         The issue is trickier than ever this season with the football team 8-0 and ranked in the top 20 nationally. An adage here says the citys cultural season starts with the first kickoff. And it is true: the Bulldogs are ascendant. Discussion of recent games is heard up and down the radio dial. Billboards feature the top players including quarterback Derek Carr a contender for the Heisman Trophy.         The police meanwhile have made cracking down on the Bulldogs gang a top priority with some success. But the Bulldogs are still dangerous enough to have cost the lives of Maciel and others.         If you love sports you want to be all geared up in the teams colors said Maciels widow Marisol Aguirre. But I dont wear any of it anymore and I dont let my kids wear it. Its too dangerous.          Pulling for the Underdog   Some 220 miles north of Los Angeles and 200 miles south of San Francisco Fresno is close to the geographic center of a state known at times for a bitter rivalry between north and south. Tensions arise over everything from water rights to disputes between Los Angeles Dodgers fans and San Francisco Giants fans.         But the bloodiest divide might be between two gangs the SureÃ±os and the NorteÃ±os who for decades have engaged in one of the most protracted guerrilla-style wars in state history.        
411,100000002534212,0,Article,News,Magazine,magazine,,Lee Harvey Oswald Was My Friend,PAUL GREGORY,4994,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/magazine/lee-harvey-oswald-was-my-friend.html,36,It was 7 a.m. on Sunday when the single phone at the bottom of the stairs echoed through my parents red-brick house right off Monticello Park in Fort Worth. Mr. Gregory a woman said as my father picked up I need your help. Who are you? he asked in his Texas-Russian accent still half-asleep.         The caller said only that she had been a student in his Russian language course at our local library and that he knew her son. In that instant my father Pete Gregory linked the voice to a nurse who sat in the back of his class and had once identified herself as Oswald. Until this phone call he hadnt realized that she was the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald a Marine who had defected to the Soviet Union only to return two and a half years later with a Russian wife and a 4-month-old daughter. My father helped Lee and his young family get settled in Fort Worth a year earlier. The Oswalds had been my friends.         My father now understood that the woman on the other end of the line Marguerite Oswald must have taken his class to communicate with her daughter-in-law Marina who spoke little English. It was also clear why she needed his help. Two days earlier Marguerites son shot the president of the United States. While Lee Harvey Oswald was sitting in a Dallas jail cell his wife and mother and two young daughters were hiding out at the Executive Inn a commuter hotel near the airport where they were taken and then abandoned by a team of Life magazine staff members. Marina Oswald had become the most wanted witness in America. She needed a translator fast.         Hours after the Kennedy assassination my parents and I experienced the shared horror of realizing that the Lee Oswald we knew the one who had been in our house and sat at our dinner table was the same man who had just been accused of killing the president. The Secret Service first knocked on my parents door at 3 a.m. on the morning of Nov. 23 1963. The following day just 45 minutes after my father hung up with Marguerite an agent named Mike Howard picked him up and drove him to a Howard Johnsons on the Fort Worth-Dallas Turnpike where they met Robert Oswald Lees brother. As the familys translator of choice my father was now part of the plan to get the Oswald women out of the dingy hotel room and into a safe house that Robert had arranged at his in-laws farm north of the city so Marina could be questioned.         The scene at the Executive Inn was worse than my father had expected. Marina already thin appeared extremely gaunt; she was having difficulty breast-feeding Rachel her younger daughter who was not yet 5 weeks old. Marguerite on the other hand was having a fit; she refused to be sent out to the sticks as she put it. My father talked her down but as the men began packing the car Agent Howard whispered that Lee Harvey Oswald had just been shot. Robert Oswald left for the hospital but Howard and my father agreed not to mention the news to Marina or Marguerite yet.         On the car ride to the safe house Marina pleaded with the agents to stop at the house of her friend Ruth Paine in Irving Tex. to pick up extra childrens supplies. But reporters were already camped out in front of Paines yard so the group was diverted to the home of the citys police chief C. J. Wirasnik. And it was there that my father told Marina in Russian that her husband just died. Marina who never knew her father said that she couldnt bear that her two children would also grow up without one. Weeping uncontrollably Marguerite shouted that as an American citizen she had as much right to see her sons body as Jackie Kennedy had to see her husbands. So eventually the group headed to Parkland Hospital where Oswald had been taken and where a belligerent crowd was already growing outside. The doctors advised Marina against viewing Oswalds body which was yellow and pale his face bruised but Marina insisted; she wanted to see the wound that killed him. A doctor pulled up the sheet to reveal the area in his torso where Jack Ruby shot him.

Beach lovers flock here happy to claim a chaise with a paperback in one hand and a cold Balashi beer in the other. But the Dutch islands manageable 20-by-6-mile dimensions and its desert landscape  calm and sandy on one coast rough and rocky on the other  make it an explorers island too. Notably multicultural with Dutch the Creole-like Papiamento Spanish and English commonly spoken the island is also increasingly sophisticated with an aloe-focused spa a new avant-garde restaurant and a Ritz-Carlton resort the islands most luxurious property set to open Nov. 22.         
413,100000002536731,0,Article,News,Movies,movies,,Thor’s Nemesis Makes Some Thunder,ROSLYN SULCAS,1423,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/movies/tom-hiddleston-gets-mythic-for-thor-the-dark-world.html,18,LONDON  In  a scene  close to the end of the 2011 superhero film Thor the two central characters confront each other. They are brothers although Loki played by the British actor Tom Hiddleston has just denied this. Loki this is madness says Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Is it madness? Mr. Hiddleston responds his face quivering with intensity his breath ragged his eyes filming with tears. Is it?  Is  it?         For a few memorable moments a multimillion-dollar wham-bam comics-based action movie is a study of fraternal love and hate of familial rage and thwarted hope of the strange combination of nature and nurture that governs an individuals actions. Its not the only moment in Thor and its sequel Thor: The Dark World which opens Friday when Mr. Hiddleston achieves this kind of Shakespearean resonance.         Theres a reason for that. Mr. Hiddleston 32 is a classically trained British actor of the most classic kind and the latest in a long line of British performers to move with remarkable dexterity between Serious Theater and mass-market cinematic fame. (He also makes a fine contribution to the noble tradition of evil soft-voiced British villains.)         His rÃ©sumÃ© is impeccable: He attended Eton Cambridge University then the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts  each on its own a notable producer of acting talent. He was a member of the celebrated  Cheek by Jowl  ensemble and recently portrayed both Prince Hal and Henry V in the BBC-PBS Shakespearean series  The Hollow Crown  to much critical acclaim. He has played F. Scott Fitzgerald in Woody Allens Midnight in Paris had featured parts in projects as varied as Steven Spielbergs War Horse and the television series Wallander and has starred in several small-scale movies.         But it wasnt until he won the role of the nefarious (or is he?) god of mischief Loki in the Disney-Marvel Studios franchise that includes Thor and The Avengers that Mr. Hiddleston hit the A-list. Now he has  fan clubs  a serious  Twitter following  and gossip column inches.         The fame thing is so odd Mr. Hiddleston said in a recent interview at the Wolseley restaurant here just a few minutes before a woman stopped by to congratulate him on his role in a coming Jim Jarmusch movie. He continued speaking of Loki Its interesting that Ive had that wide impact in a role that is so unlike me.         Its true that the real-life Mr. Hiddleston doesnt much resemble Loki with his vampiric pallor long black hair and impassive mocking stare. In person he is unobtrusively handsome with light brown curly hair an open friendly manner and the physical elegance of a (very tall) dancer. He is also articulate thoughtful and given to poetic turns of phrase.         Asked if he wanted to be an actor from a young age he said it wasnt that cut and dried: Its rather like a murmuration of swallows. You cant tell which bird made the first move it just takes shape. He added: Im wary of imposing narratives from a safe distance. Its always more arbitrary than it seems.         Mr. Hiddleston grew up in Oxford the middle child of a Scottish father who ran a pharmaceutical company and an English mother who had worked as a stage manager. He was 13 or 14 he said when he first thought seriously about acting.         I saw Richard Eyres production of Ibsens John Gabriel Borkman and it hit me like a train he said. I had that wonderful Alice-down-the-rabbit-hole experience of developing an insatiable appetite for watching and reading that I think is very particular to those adolescent years.         He acted as much as he could at Eton and in his final year the school took a production of  Journeys End  the 1928 R. C. Sherriff drama about World War I soldiers to the Edinburgh International Festival where it won rave reviews. It was a turning point Mr. Hiddleston said the moment when he made a silent decision to become a professional actor. He nonetheless went to Cambridge to pursue a degree in Latin and Greek (I had worked too hard to get there to miss out) joined the universitys famously strong drama club and was spotted in his second semester by an agent who told him she would get him jobs during his vacations.         Professional work including two HBO productions  Conspiracy  and  The Gathering Storm  soon came his way  although never during the vacations. Mr. Hiddleston found himself reading Cicero on set in full costume but managed to graduate with top marks. (Yes as well as handsome and poetic he is also clever.)         He could have gone straight into acting but decided instead to attend drama school for three years. I thought Im not trained and Ive been luckyÂ  Mr. Hiddleston said. When he graduated he found that memories were short. I kept a diary with all the details of every audition he said. After about three months I had to stop because it was a catalog of failure a long list of jobs I had failed to get.         Nevertheless he eventually won the main role in his first film Joanna Hoggs  Unrelated  from 2007 and theater productions followed that brought him to the attention of Kenneth Branagh with whom he subsequently worked in a stage production of Ivanov and on Wallander.                Also in Video »       
414,100000002534072,0,Article,News,Travel,travel,,Hotel Review: Hotel Monaco in Philadelphia,FREDA MOON,523,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/travel/hotel-review-hotel-monaco-in-philadelphia.html,4, Rates   From $169 to $469.          Basics    Hotel Monaco  is a big instant classic in Philadelphias Old City. Philadelphias second Kimpton property the LEED-registered Hotel Monaco opened in October 2012 in the Lafayette Building an imposing 1907 Greek Revival edifice with an eclectic colorful interior (porthole-shaped mirrors in the elevators and a Swarovski crystal galleon hanging in the entryway). From the moment we arrived and were greeted with a disarming Welcome home the Monaco had uncommon warmth.          Location   The 11-story 268-room Monaco overlooks the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. Although the hotel is just blocks from Interstate 95 and accessible by car parking is either inconvenient or pricey (the self-park garage two blocks away is about $20 a day; valet is $40). For public transit the Fifth Street subway is a three-minute walk away. From there its five stops to the regional buses and Amtrak train service at 30th Street Station.          The Room   With its many mirrored surfaces giraffe-print bathrobes walls papered with images of grandfather clocks and peacocks and a color scheme heavy in reds blues and yellows the dÃ©cor was whimsical as in Alice in Wonderland meets the Ringling Brothers. Our 465-square-foot corner King Spa Room had a king-size bed with Frette sheets a 40-inch flat screen TV and an iHome docking station. The mini-fridge which had inadvertently been left unplugged offered a room-temperature bottle of Mendocino County chardonnay a selection of regional beers and snacks like Kopali organic chocolate-covered bananas and KIND snack bars. Glass doors to the wrought-iron balconies do not open.          The Bathroom   The enormous bathroom had cherry red tiles ornate floral wallpaper and bright tubes of Kimptons house brand Etro of Italy toiletries. There was both a massive stand-alone egg-shaped soaking tub with a view of the brick facades and leafy parks below and a separate shower with a small teak bench.          Amenities   The hotels rooftop lounge Stratus has bulbous wicker lounge chairs garage-style doors to guard against the seasonal cold and a dramatic winged sculpture on the deck. With a full bar and a menu of social bites like yellowfin tuna tostadas ($14) and spicy pulled-pork sliders with caramelized onion ($5 each) it has become a hot spot for stylish 20- and 30-somethings  a success that seemed on our visit to have overwhelmed its servers. Other more practical hotel perks include a well-equipped workout room free Wi-Fi for guests who sign up for the Kimpton loyalty rewards program and a modest two-computer business center with a universal phone charger for those who find themselves without. There are also thoughtful touches like a pair of slipper socks ($15 to purchase) in each closet an umbrella available for borrowing and a daily wine reception.          Room Service   The room service left something to be desired during our stay in the hotel then newly opened. Our breakfast (a bagel with lox and oatmeal) came lukewarm 45 minutes after being ordered from the Red Owl Tavern the hotels street-level restaurant.          Bottom Line   A charming colorful and affordable addition to Philadelphias downtown with some room for improvement in its in-room dining and lounge service.Â          
415,100000002534067,0,Article,News,Travel,travel,,"Beyond Orlando’s Theme Parks, a Beer Culture Grows",SHIVANI VORA,790,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/travel/beyond-orlandos-theme-parks-a-beer-culture-grows.html,13,Craft beer is usually not what comes to mind when thinking about Orlando. Walt Disney World Universal Studios or another splashy theme park yes but not beer. Today however this landlocked central Florida city is getting a reputation for its growing craft beer scene. In the past few years locals in the Orlando area have opened bars offering a wide selection of beers from small producers and some are even opening spots that serve ales brewed in house.         The Florida Brewers Guild a nonprofit association said there are now 20 to 25 breweries and craft beer bars in the Orlando area compared with five years ago when there were fewer than 10.         The roots of the growing culture date to the opening of beer-centric bars like  Redlight Redlight Beer Parlour  (2810 Corrine Drive Orlando; 407-893-9832;  redlightredlightbeerparlour.com ). This casual and large bar housed in an industrial-looking space was a novelty when it opened in 2005. It has a menu of 26 rotating drafts as well as 300 bottles from small producers around the world. It also has more than 50 varieties of sour wild beers from countries including Switzerland Italy and Belgium offering a flavor profile that can taste at times like sour candy. Another spot spearheading the movement is  Milk Bar ( 2424 East Robinson Street Orlando; 407-715-2138;  themilkbarorlando.com ) which is about a 10-minute drive away. A local restaurateur Bret Ashman opened the 750-square-foot space named after the milk factory across the street because of his longtime passion for smaller niche brands. The menu at the three-year-old bar has 90 options and there are two 42-inch televisions connected to Xbox and Sega gaming systems that customers are encouraged to use. Were trying to be a user-friendly version of your best guy friends house Mr. Ashman said.         But the interest in beer has become even more specialized with establishments selling varieties crafted on site like the year-old  Cask & Larder.  The lively restaurant and bar (565 West Fairbanks Avenue Winter Park; 321-280-4200;  caskandlarder.com ) has a menu of nine rotating ales that Ron Raike 48 brews in a glassed room so customers can watch the process. A highlight of a Cask & Larder visit is a meal in which his beer is paired with Southern-influenced cuisine such as a fish fry with okra and hush puppies or chicken and biscuits. An eight-person table in the brewing room is also the setting for five-course pairing dinners. You dont hear about food and beer complementing each other the way you do about wine but we want to show our guests that it can work just as well he said.         Food isnt offered at all at the year-old  Hourglass Brewery  (255 South Reagan Boulevard Longwood; 407-262-0056;  thehourglassbrewery.com ) which was started by two high school best friends Sky Conley 31 and Brett Mason 32 who home-brewed for years while they had other jobs. The 900-square-foot venue is only large enough for a small brewing area and tap room and has a giant mural of space-themed movies like Star Wars adorning one wall and mixed media pencil and canvas works from local artists on another. Mr. Conley makes 60 kinds of beers such as an India Pale Ale and Mocha Imperial Stout and usually offers nine at a time weaving in seasonal varieties like one for autumn using butternut squash and Brazil nuts.         Since its 2012 opening Hourglass has become one of the most happening hangouts in town with a jammed bar during peak hours and lines spilling out the door.          Orlando Brewing  (1301 Atlanta Avenue Orlando; 407-872-1117;  orlandobrewing.com ) which bills itself as the only U.S.D.A.-certified organic brewery in Florida has an equally lively ambience but in a roomier 7000-square-foot setting. Local bands play styles like bluegrass and country music on weekends and food trucks come out for special events but beer has always taken center stage since the bar opened in 2006.         Its taken a few years to get a collective sense of Orlandos beer culture because the area and the ale houses are so spread out.  Mount Dora  (405 South Highland Street Mount Dora; 352-406-2924;  mountdorabrewing.com ) for instance is a 45-minute trip out of the city. Jeff Herbst 59 opened the brewery and restaurant in 2011 in three small early-20th-century houses that were his workshops when he was a furniture builder. He brews his six ales like the rich and dark Pistoville Porter in one building; a restaurant serving bar food like burgers and salads and a tap room are in the other two.         Mr. Raike the brewmaster at Cask & Larder remembers the days when the only place he could find craft beers was his home where he brewed as a hobby. It used to be a beer wasteland he said. Now thats finally changing.                Also in Video »       
416,100000002533896,0,Article,News,Travel,travel,,"Beneath Martinique’s Beauty, Guided by a Poet",SYLVIE BIGAR,1766,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/travel/beneath-martiniques-beauty-guided-by-a-poet.html,10,As the stories poured out eyes sparkled smiles widened hands danced. Everyone I met on Martinique harbored at least one intimate memory of  AimÃ© CÃ©saire   a quiet encounter or speech etched forever in their consciousness  but they all agreed: this poet playwright and politician who achieved an almost monumental status on the Caribbean island was the most humble man they had ever known.         Take for instance Daniel Houcou one of two drivers assigned to Mr. CÃ©saire in the final decade of his life. Most afternoons Mr. Houcou would ferry the poet as he crisscrossed the 45-mile-long island armed with his beloved botanic treatise (its title seems to be lost to history). He would suddenly spot a tree and ask me to stop and climb in the back so we could look it up together Mr. Houcou said.         I first visited Martinique at age 15 on a tropical interlude with my Swiss parents and was instantly engulfed in the Caribbean breath. It would be the first of many visits. As an adult after a move to New York I began to venture beyond the bougainvillea and the beaches. I hiked the menacing volcano  Mount PelÃ©e ; I explored the rain forest; I discovered the people. And then I discovered Mr. CÃ©saires words and was bewitched. They gave me new insights into the painful history of Martinique.         Though raw enraged even his poetry is anchored in his love of his native land: My beautiful country with its high sesame shores he called it. So when I heard that this year marked the 100th anniversary of his birth (he died in 2008) I planned a voyage through Martinique and its history with its favorite son as my guide. In the waves along the windy slopes of the volcano in the banana fields his voice unearthed for me the human tales hidden under the beauty of the island.         Born in 1913 on what was then a French colony Mr. CÃ©saire spent his formative years in the 1930s studying in Paris where with the help of other prominent black intellectuals he established the concept of  nÃ©gritude  the conscious act of acceptance and pride in ones own African background and a rejection of colonial racism and oppression.         In 1939 Mr. CÃ©saire then only 26 returned to Martinique to teach literature shortly after the publication of Notebook of a Return to the Native Land. The anti-colonialist surrealist scream of a poem put the idea of nÃ©gritude into action exposing the horrors of slavery and its legacy. We are walking compost hideously promising tender cane and silky cotton he wrote. In 1941 a ship carrying a group of writers and artists fleeing occupied France docked on the island. Mr. CÃ©saires subsequent interactions with the French surrealist AndrÃ© Breton and the Cuban artist Wilfredo Lam whose attentions helped bring Mr. CÃ©saire to prominence started a lifelong network of friendship and intellectual exchange.         In 1945 Mr. CÃ©saire was asked to head the Communist ballot in the mayoral elections of Fort-de-France the capital and to his surprise he was elected mayor a position he held until 2001 (except briefly in 1983 and 1984). Days before  Soviet tanks invaded Budapest in 1956  he resigned from the French Communist Party and later helped to found the Martinican Progressive Party. For 48 years Papa CÃ©saire as many still call him also served as deputy of Martinique to the National Assembly in Paris where he led the peaceful transition from French colony to department.         Assisting me in my mission was the tall elegant and affable Mr. Houcou. We started in Fort-de-France where even the airport is named for Mr. CÃ©saire and then followed the sinuous Route de la Trace built on the site of an old trail used by Jesuits in the 18th century stopping at Camp Balata a park and 19th-century military fort where the poet often strolled. To one side of me the five cone-shaped peaks of the volcanic Pitons du Carbet range loomed in the distance; to the other the bay of Fort-de-France shimmered under the sun. As I walked the literary path the city had recently installed along an allÃ©e of majestic mahogany trees I paused to read markers featuring quotes from Breton and prominent Martinicans including Mr. CÃ©saire: I am obsessed with nature with the flower with the root one of his reads. It is all linked to my situation as a man exiled from his primordial.         We headed to the  Balata Botanical Garden  where I tiptoed hesitantly on the swaying aerial bridges terrified to look down. Safely across and breathing again I recognized the sculptural red heliconia flower  the symbol of Mr. CÃ©saires Progressive party. As we drove on the rain forest grew impenetrable. Ripples of wind along walls of gigantic ferns brought to mind the otherworldly chatter of the arborescent ferns that Mr. CÃ©saire wrote about in his poem Rapacious Space.         I was eager to get to his seaside hometown Basse-Pointe where he loved to watch the Atlantic breakers from TrinitÃ© to Grand-RiviÃ¨re / the hysterical grand lick of the sea. Only an hour away from the tropical forest a steep cul-de-sac led to a cove where black sand  volcanic powder really  painted the water emerald green and the deafening surf sounded a continuous drumbeat.

During their three years there the $2050-a-month rent had risen to $2300  still a steal but not the same sort of steal Ms. Placzek said.         In any event she added there were obvious things that were not O.K. about it. The apartment had a shared back patio but little light. The tiny kitchen was a problem for Ms. Wolinetz 34 who works in online advertising and also has a culinary degree. It was a balancing act of Jenga-like proportions to cook in that space she said. After entertaining friends she refused cleanup help because there was room for only one person.         Worst of all was the slippery wooden spiral staircase erupting from the floor like a submarine hatch said Ms. Placzek 30 who works for a wine importer. It led to the downstairs bedroom large but dark.         They had a no socks on the stairs rule to guard against slips and falls. The wall was dented from some past tenants knee. I gave myself a carpet burn through my pants falling down those steps Ms. Placzek said.         The two who met through friends and were married in Montreal two years ago were also planning to start a family so it was time to both upgrade and buy. They wanted a two-bedroom with two bathrooms a sizable kitchen outdoor space and a washer/dryer. Their budget topped out at $700000.         They couldnt afford to stay on the Upper West Side. Purchase prices were affordable but maintenance charges seemed ridiculously high.         After scrutinizing online listings the couple found a condominium in a former industrial building on 15th Street in Park Slope  Brooklyn  for $659000 plus around $500 in monthly charges. Though it seemed dark it included a terrace and a washer/dryer. They liked it but not quite enough.         It was still early in the hunt and I felt we didnt have our act together Ms. Placzek said. Feeling pressed to make an offer I felt myself getting nervous and frantic. They moved on and that apartment later sold for $645000.         In  Co-op Village  on the Lower East Side where friends lived prices were right  generally in the low $500000s with maintenance around $800. One two-bedroom was especially to their liking with a huge kitchen and a lot of closet space. But the boxy layout was boring. The neighborhood lacked greenery and was far from the subway. We would be taking exponentially more cabs Ms. Wolinetz said.         Along the way Ms. Placzek said they realized that we needed someone in our corner so she contacted Victoria Hagman the founder of Realty Collective formerly her downstairs neighbor.         Last fall the three met for coffee and formulated a plan. Ms. Hagman emphasized the importance of layout. We had a lot of room in our bedroom that we didnt use Ms. Placzek said. Right off the bat I was like if we have to have a tiny shoe-box bedroom thats O.K. We dont hang out in the bedroom. A big living area was more important.         Their first foray with Ms. Hagman was back to 15th Street in Park Slope this time to a duplex two-bedroom condominium in a prewar building. To their surprise they immediately knew it was for them.         The apartment lacked outdoor space but the light made up for that. There was no washer/dryer but the building had a basement laundry room. The master bedroom was small but big enough.         It is as though you had taken our apartment on 69th Street doubled it and moved it to Park Slope Ms. Wolinetz said  right down to the spiral staircase. But for some reason this spiral staircase didnt bother them. It was made of metal not wood and was less steep.         Such a change of heart is common Ms. Hagman said. Often clients say they dont want this this and this but they get into the space and say they can make an exception. We threw the plan we created an hour before out the window and made an offer.         The couple bought the place for $626000 just above the asking price; monthly charges are almost $1100. Then they waited. The building was being converted from a rental to a condominium. They were finally able to move in the summer.         It is light and airy and warm and cozy at the same time Ms. Wolinetz said. She can cook elaborate meals in the big kitchen. With a dishwasher theres little need for cleanup help.         Their longer commutes to work are not a problem. You can read a lot more  its O.K. Ms. Placzek said.         Their bedroom in the back of the building is quiet. They were not however expecting to hear loud traffic noise in the living room. Whenever they had viewed the apartment the windows had been closed. For weeks their cat Rue hid from the sound. It is a lot of turning the volume up on the TV and turning it down Ms. Wolinetz said. I put in a vote to start looking into soundproof windows.         Being homeowners is a big change. They engaged a designer who helped them pick out furniture and replaced two giant ancient radiators with sleek new ones. That was about the most adult moment I feel Ive ever had Ms. Wolinetz said. You can rip out radiators? I didnt even know it was something you could do.         They added bookshelves and wine racks behind the spiral staircase. At some point they will gate it off because Ms. Placzek is now pregnant. The baby is due in the spring.         At their housewarming their friends told them Â It feels like you guys have always lived hereÂ  Ms. Placzek said. That expresses it completely.         E-mail: thehunt@ nytimes.com          Also in T Magazine »       
418,100000002533535,0,Article,News,Magazine,magazine,,Remembering Marcella,MARK BITTMAN,982,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/magazine/remembering-marcella.html,46,Marcella Hazan who died Sept. 29 at the age of 89 never intended to bring real Italian cooking to America. But no matter how accidental her impact it can hardly be overstated. What Alice Waters did for restaurants Hazan did for home cooks demonstrating that the simple treatment of decent ingredients leads to wonderful dishes.         In a way Hazan was the anti-Julia Child and Child had a sense of that. In a conversation shortly before her own death Child said to me: I dont get the whole thing with Italian cooking. They put some herbs on things they put them in the oven and they take them out again. Exactly.         Born in Cesenatico Italy in 1924 Hazan did not have it easy early in her life. A childhood accident left her with a permanently damaged right arm which restricted its use and as recounted in her biography Amarcord: Marcella Remembers she spent the war years in trying circumstances. After marrying Victor Hazan in 1955 she moved to New York so that he could work in his familys fur business. At the time she spoke no English. In Italy she earned her doctorate in biology but by the late 60s she decided to pursue cooking instead.         When I visited and cooked with her and Victor just over two weeks before she died Hazan told me that she learned almost nothing about cooking when she was young. The first class she took in 1968 was devoted to Chinese cuisine but when the course ended her classmates asked her to teach them Italian cooking. Her aptitude immediately became evident.         Encouraged by Victor she began teaching classes from her home. (Victor who has written extensively about wine was Marcellas usually unacknowledged translator and co-writer not to mention her muse.) She had a talent for uncovering the soul of Italian cooking and for making its essences readily understandable to the growing number of American home cooks who were flocking to Italy and its cuisine in the 70s and 80s. Soon there was a lunch with The Timess Craig Claiborne and a visit from the Harper & Row editor Peter Mollman who on the spot signed her up to write a cookbook.         The Classic Italian Cookbook was published in 1973; it was said to be the first to focus on northern Italian cuisine but it was really much more than that. It was the first popular Italian cookbook to go beyond red sauce. In fact it wasnt strictly northern (as if there even were a northern Italian cuisine) but more pan-Italian a door into the wonders of Italian regional cooking which Marcella and Victor were discovering even while they were writing about it.         By the time I was developing a career in food writing  say 1983  Marcella was as meaningful as Julia was a decade earlier. To me Hazan was the more important author; it was cooking from her book that taught me to interpret Childs work in a way that felt contemporary.         In 1997 I contacted her and Victor asking if I could cook with her in Venice where they were then living for an article in The Times. We arranged to meet at the Rialto market where she came flying along in sneakers full of energy at a wrinkled (she was a lifelong smoker) but buoyant 73. I had never been to the Rialto with such a knowledgeable guide  few have  and she showed me the men who could dismember an artichoke in 10 seconds the vendors whose porcini could be trusted to come from Italy the radicchio of Treviso the seafood of the lagoon.         We cooked pasta with clams using the thumbnail-size telline she knew made the dish perfect. There were other creations but most memorable was the market visit and the simple pasta that I was preparing with the woman who had taught it to me even though I was a complete stranger. I left with the feeling of a successful family visit.         I stayed in touch with them over the years; once Victor wrote to take me to task for a risotto shortcut I took on a video. This past summer when I spent some time with old cookbooks I came across Hazans. It was a joy revisiting recipes that had in part made me the cook I became. (Like Hazan I learned little about cooking as a child.) On a whim I emailed Victor and asked if I might travel to Florida where theyd retired and cook with them once again. We made arrangements almost right away.         On a warm beautiful day in their apartment overlooking the Gulf of Mexico a much-diminished Marcella grew more talkative and energetic as we cooked. She worked on a  roasted endive dish  that despite its ridiculous simplicity is astonishing in its flavor and tenderness. (Do not skimp on oil time salt or pepper.) She helped make her  famous tomato sauce  a slow-cooked affair of canned tomatoes a lot of butter (again dont withhold) and half an onion. Its perhaps the best tomato sauce you can make without doing much of anything and we ate it on store-bought pasta Hazan apologizing that she lacked the energy to make gnocchi. She showed me how to pound lamb chops for  her splendid dish  and teased me for not doing it thoroughly enough. We planned to make an  orange cake  but in the end didnt; dessert was ice cream topped with coffee grounds and whiskey.         Long before I cooked with her I felt I knew Hazan through her cookbooks. By the end of this meal I felt again as if I had been reunited with family and we discussed another visit when winter came. If Victor will have me Ill be there and we can drink to the woman who was largely responsible  however unintentionally  for bringing real Italian food to the United States.         This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 6 2013 An earlier version of a description of a video with this article misstated the given name of Marcella Hazans husband. As the article correctly notes he is Victor not Vincent.

The cause of the affliction however varies. Some say ticket prices. Others blame those miserable critics. Television and the Internet are occasionally villains in this drama. But for a historically minded set a crucial data point in this tragedy is the decline of the repertory a resident company of actors of the sort that say Shakespeare used at the Globe.          And Away We Go  a new play by Terrence McNally whose work displays a clear love and commitment to the stage is aÂ  tribute Â to the repertory. Presented at the Pearl Theater which has a repertory this time-traveling backstage drama zips from ancient Greece at the premiere of Aeschylus Oresteia to the opening of Chekhovs Seagull to the American premiere of Becketts Waiting for Godot which was oddly in Coral Gables Fla.

420,100000002536940,0,Article,News,Arts,arts,music,"Blurring Art, Artifice and Pop Culture",JON PARELES,1347,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/arts/music/blurring-art-artifice-and-pop-culture.html,22,Lady Gaga the relentless is back in full force on Artpop (Streamline/Interscope) her third full-length studio album of new songs. It took hip surgery for injuries that she had aggravated onstage to knock her off her tour and sideline her from media exposure for a few months earlier this year. But in summer the next push began with a single  Applause  that simultaneously reaffirmed her need for the love of her audience and announced her new pivot to align herself with the (visual) art world singing Pop culture was in art now arts in pop culture in me.         My misgivings started then. Wasnt she an artist already?         Lady Gaga born Stefani Germanotta has certainly worked like one mingling the generalized and the personal the accessible and the inexplicable the attention-getting and the head-scratching the market-savvy and the strange. As strong as her commercial imperatives were they only emboldened her nutty streak. When she emerged Lady Gaga didnt separate pop culture and art. Like the best pop stars she made the mass media her gallery space.         Her multimillion-selling singles like Bad Romance and  Paparazzi  joined catchy choruses to verses that probed obsessions and contradictions showing where desire ambition self-realization and self-destruction could converge. Atop her music in video clips and public appearances she piled on a nonstop nearly superhuman fashion show and a public image that expanded to embrace misfit outcast unappreciated and sexually nonconformist little monsters as she named her fans.         But Artpop positions her in a more rarefied zone: with the kind of performance and gallery artists more likely to be seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music than at an arena concert.         Of course musicians are artists creating impractical works out of intuition compulsion and craft. And of course there are affinities among all the arts. Musicians and visual artists exploring in tandem found the synergies of Stravinsky and Diaghilev the Velvet Underground and Andy Warhol Black Flag and  Ray Pettibon ; art colleges have incubated maverick musicians like John Lennon David Bowie M.I.A. and the members of Roxy Music Talking Heads and Sonic Youth. But those were contemporaries working with street-level contemporaries at least at the beginning. Pops newer fine-art infatuation has more to do with stars meeting stars and luxury brands doing co-promotions.         The  cover of Artpop  is a sculpture of a blond Lady Gaga cupping her breasts and holding a big shiny blue sphere between her legs. Its by the pop artist Jeff Koons who is renowned for his blown-up renditions of ephemeral and banal objects like the steel  Balloon Dog (Orange)  that Christies expects to sell on Tuesday  a day after the planned release of Artpop  for $35 million to $55 million. Its a portrait of a pop star by an art star  but its stiff and detached.         Lady Gaga has also announced collaborations with avant-garde elders like the theater artist Robert Wilson and the performance artist Marina Abramovic who has lately also turned up  alongside Jay-Z . On her  Facebook page  Lady Gaga wrote that Artpop would be released with an app that she described as a musical and visual engineering system that combines music art fashion and technology with a new interactive worldwide community  the auras.Â  She went on Altering the human experience with social media we bring  art  culture into  pop  in a reverse Warholian expedition.         Whatever.         The music on Artpop isnt as convoluted. My artpop could mean anything Lady Gaga sings in the title song and most of the time it means putting the four-on-the-floor thrust of mainstream club music behind the kind of big pop hooks that made her a superstar.         Lady Gaga conquered the world with The Fame her 2008 album of rocked-up dance tunes and its EP sequel The Fame Monster in 2009. Then her 2011 Born This Way made its predecessors sound temperate. In songs that juggled Christian imagery and pagan rocker Lady Gaga piled on vocal bluster and musical excesses remembered from decades past. Sales of Born This Way didnt match those of her debut album  in part because its songs didnt dovetail as well with radio formats  but they still added up to millions worldwide.         Now with Artpop Lady Gaga turns oddly defensive reacting to her endless media brouhaha instead of leading it. She advertised Applause with a pre-emptive heavy-handedly ironic video clip called  Lady Gaga Is Over.  In the title song of Artpop she dismisses the notion of a commercial downturn singing I tried to sell myself but I am really laughing/Because I just love the music not the bling. She reiterates the sentiment in Jewels & Drugs a misfired attempt at hip-hop insisting Dont want your money want your love. And the lyrics of her current single Do What U Want with its chorus Do what you want with my body are directed not to a lover but to media coverage printing things that makes me want to scream; my body is her image separate from her mind or heart. R. Kelly joins her to sympathize about the crazy schedule fast life of a fellow star before he offers his come-on.         The album teases with promises of candor. Its opener  Aura  pauses its thumping beat as Lady Gaga croons Do you want to see the girl who lives behind the aura? (The lyrics also unwisely play with the metaphor of a burqa.) Elsewhere songs touch repeatedly on thoughts of addiction: to intoxicants to attention to lust to love.  Dope  is an Elton John-style piano ballad that works up to wrenching belting melodrama as she sings about trying to give up bad habits because I need you more than dope. She and her co-producer Rick Rubin apparently didnt apply pitch correction to the vocal lending some intimacy to the stadium-sized emotions; you might be a lover or her audience.         But for most of the album the music is a fortress  more elaborate than Born This Way and decidedly less retro pumping so insistently it sometimes forgets to breathe. Lady Gagas main songwriting collaborator is DJ White Shadow (Paul Blair) whose productions often top booming drum tracks with rock guitars. She also enlisted  Zedd  (Anton Zaslavski) a German electronic dance music producer who had his own million-selling single with  Clarity  in 2012; in his tracks thumping beats and buzzing abrasive bass lines drive the verses to gleaming club-anthem choruses.         There are still some sparks of eccentricity. Venus a mutating episodic dance-floor track produced by Lady Gaga herself starts with a quotation from Sun Ra (who shares songwriting credit) before the singer presents herself as the goddess of love in the seashell bikini painted by Botticelli.         But for much of the album Artpop also seems to be working off a checklist that Lady Gaga chants in Aura: tech dance sex art pop. For gender-blurring sexuality theres G.U.Y. (which stands for girl under you) Manicure and Sexxx Dreams which fantasizes  to echoes of 1980s Janet Jackson  about getting nasty and trashy with someone whose boyfriend is out of town. For pop theres a booming cheerless cheerleader-chant song Mary Jane Holland thats nearly a single entendre about marijuana.         Not on the checklist but definitely on the agenda for trademark reinforcement are songs about clothes. Lady Gagas shallowest thoughts to date about style are in Donatella an oddly backhanded tribute to her friend Donatella Versace delivered in a nasal comic sneer  and Fashion! produced by Will.i.am and David Guetta to mimic David Bowies Lets Dance while Lady Gaga sings Looking good and feeling fine sounding like a jingle.         Whats missing from too much of Artpop is Lady Gagas old conviction that pop in its 21st-century configuration as music plus video plus  social media  plus celebrity could tell every story she wanted to tell all at once trashy and transcendent. Her stage spectaculars have already built arty superstructures on her songs: sexy disruptive funny unsettling ones. Validation from the fine-arts world  a much more elitist insular place than pops mass market  shouldnt matter anywhere nearly as much as stirring the passions of the little monsters.

421,100000002533553,0,Article,News,Magazine,magazine,,The Coach Who Exploded,JONATHAN MAHLER,6693,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/magazine/the-coach-who-exploded.html,30,Mike Rice is coaching again. Or rather hes running after-school clinics for third-to-sixth graders at a vast four-court indoor basketball facility in Neptune N.J. where he also works out local high-school players on Friday afternoons and coaches his sons high-school team in a fall recreational league.         Considering where Rice was a year ago  preparing for his third season as head coach at Rutgers University with a guaranteed salary of $700000  it is quite a step down. Of course considering where Rice was seven months ago  a figure of national disgrace who was fired for mistreating his players  its a little hard to believe hes coaching at all. It helps when your best friend owns the place Rice said.         We were watching his sons team Red Bank Regional High School warm up before a recent game against the inauspiciously named Brick Township High. Red Bank looked like your average suburban high-school team with the exception of one kid. When I asked Rice about him he said: The big man is terrible. Just watch.         The instant the game got under way Rice started pacing manically up and down the floor yelling nonstop his raspy voice echoing across the gym. He hollered at his team after every trip down the court invariably singling out players both for doing something right (Are you kidding me? he said when one of them squeezed between two defenders and laid the ball in off the glass. Youve got ballerina feet!) or wrong (Ben youre fighting for time! You get in the game and the first thing you do is give up an  and-1? ).         Rice wasnt berating anyone and he definitely wasnt abusing anyone. Yet if youd been watching him that night you might very well have thought That guy is nuts.         He was right though: The big man had a long way to go. After he made one halfhearted attempt to stop a much smaller opponent from driving to the basket Rice did a sideline demonstration for him: This is a lion he said proceeding to roar loudly and menacingly raise both arms above his head. Then Rice lowered his arms limply by his side. This is a wimpy little cat:  Meow . Be a lion!         The big surprise of the night was Rices son Mike III a skinny sophomore guard who looked like a boy playing with men. He came off the bench midway through the first half and reeled off a couple of 3-pointers a reverse layup and a teardrop shot off the dribble in the lane.         Rice and I had talked about his sons game a few times and Rice did not always sound optimistic. Ive got to get him more into academics he told me once after receiving a text message from his wife informing him that Mike III had just been benched after going 0 for 3 in an A.A.U. game.         Mike III has no shortage of ability and an excess of basketball intelligence and Rice personally works him out in their driveway regularly. But he has a tendency to overthink things which can be deadly for an athlete. It also makes him very different from his father and his fathers father. As Rice put it: Rices generally go in headfirst and then think later.          Mike Rice was  introduced to America last April when ESPN aired footage of him screaming at and demeaning his players yanking them by their jerseys shoving them kicking them; throwing balls at their heads and groins; taunting them with homophobic slurs. Within 24 hours millions of people had watched it and Rice had been denounced by everyone from LeBron James to Gov. Chris Christie. He was soon fired and disappeared from the public eye as abruptly as he entered it.         I first met Rice at the gym in Neptune on a hot humid night about two months after all this happened. His daughters under-12 A.A.U. team which Rice also coachesÂ­ on a volunteer basis had just annihilated an opponent 47-11. The other team could barely keep possession of the ball never mind get off a decent shot. I introduced myself to Rice and told him that I felt a little sorry for their opponents. I dont he said. Tell them to work harder.         After the game Rice invited me back to his house in nearby Little Silver N.J. Rice is frenetic on the sidelines of a basketball court but his resting state is pretty wired to begin with his voice often rising to a half-yell even in casual conversation. Have a beer for Christs sake! he shouted at me after I initially declined.         His wife Kerry offered to go out and get some dinner for us but couldnt find her car key. After some searching around Rice produced it from his pocket. Sorry Pookie Bear he said.         For the next two hours we sat at a table on his deck swatting mosquitoes drinking beer and eating Italian takeout. His kids were inside watching the N.B.A. playoffs and Kerry eventually came out and joined us.         It was the first time that Rice had spoken to a reporter since delivering a brief statement of apology from his doorstep the day he was fired a strategic decision that was not easy for him to accept. Everything Ive ever done is fight scratch and claw he told me and now I have to sit back and take it listen to people say I was abusing my players? I was an idiot but I never abused anybody.         Jonathan Mahler  is a contributing writer for the magazine a columnist for Bloomberg View and the author of Ladies and Gentlemen the Bronx Is Burning. Editor:  Dean Robinson
422,100000002529632,0,Article,News,Travel,travel,,"Restaurant Report: Cúrate in Asheville, N.C.",ALEX CREVAR,398,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/travel/restaurant-report-curate-in-asheville-nc.html,4,On paper the recipe for CÃºrate a traditional Spanish tapas restaurant that opened in 2011 in downtown Asheville seems to lack some requisite ingredients. First the chef and co-owner Katie Button isnt Spanish. Then theres the fact that just six years ago she was a budding scientist not a restaurateur. Finally real Spanish food is an anomaly in this part of the country where farm-to-table Americana is firmly rooted.         But successful business recipes like culinary ones are often based on passion and instincts not textbook conformity.         We kept thinking Whats missing in Asheville and what do we want to contribute?  said Ms. Button 30 who opted out of a neuroscience doctoral program to learn the culinary trade with stints at El Bulli in Spain Jean-Georges in New York and two JosÃ© AndrÃ©s restaurants.         A 40-foot marble bar and a frenetic open kitchen dominate CÃºrate (pronounced COO-rah-tay) which was a bus depot in the 1920s. During a visit in late summer waiters glided between tables describing the menus authentically prepared tapas  like the pulpo a la gallega: warm octopus flavored with sea salt olive oil and paprika and accompanied by purÃ©ed potatoes  in accents that mix Southern English and Catalan. Neighbors became part of the conversation offering views on the merits of different charcuterie platters and suggesting bottles from a list of Spanish-only wines.         The style of dining is about community and sharing interacting with the people you are dining with in a different way said Ms. Button whom Mr. AndrÃ©s recently nominated as one of the top artists for the next generation.         Ms. Buttons artistry and lab training are at work in a wide range of precise complex dishes. The rossejat negro combined toasted noodles seared squid in its own ink roasted garlic and salsa verde. The lamb skewers were marinated with a perfect blend of Moorish spices. And for dessert the miel y matÃ³ awakened taste buds with honey drizzled over a roasted strawberry a sorbet of rosÃ© cava and a frozen goat-cheese meringue.         Ms. Button acknowledged that CÃºrate is just hitting its stride. Its popularity also continues to grow. Weve been successful because we care so much about our guests experience she said. Success though brings the challenge of volume and higher expectations.

Tokyo a city Mr. Kinch first visited in 1989 and returns to regularly is he said the greatest eating city in the world.         Its pretty hard to top the quality of food and the amount of restaurants and the diversity of styles that goes on there he said.         Its really hard to find bad food there he added.         Below are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Kinch on eating in Tokyo.Â          
424,100000002535890,0,Article,News,Real Estate,realestate,,"On Staten Island, Wilderness With Creature Comforts",ALISON GREGOR,565,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/realestate/on-staten-island-wilderness-with-creature-comforts.html,10,Its not surprising that the 19th-century transcendentalists were attracted to Emerson Hill on  Staten Island : The neighborhood still has a measure of the natural beauty of the wilderness that first attracted those poets and philosophers.         Abounding in beeches and oaks of great height and age the area is named for William Emerson a former resident and a brother of the poet Ralph Waldo Emerson who was a frequent visitor along with the likes of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry David Thoreau. Up a hill that has only two unassuming entrances this neighborhood of just over 100 houses hidden in thickets has retained anonymity even by the standards of an island borough  a kind of side benefit of its geography.         Before George Marchese bought his four-bedroom home here about a decade ago he had never heard of Emerson Hill.         I lived on Staten Island for 10 years 12 years and I didnt know it existed Mr. Marchese said. I used to drive by it all the time and one day there were balloons out there at the bottom of the hill where it says No Through Traffic and it looks like a giant driveway. A sign said Open House and I said: What the heck is this? You can go up this hill?Â          Mr. Marchese did and made an offer on the house as soon as he saw its tree-trimmed property and the sprawling views from its back deck.         To the left was the city to the right was  New Jersey  and right in dead center was the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge he said and it was so beautiful. The agent came out and said You want to see the rest of the house? And I said No I just want to make an offer.Â          The current estimate for that house for which Mr. Marchese paid about $900000 a decade ago may be almost $1.2 million he said; it has appreciated far less than he had originally hoped. But the value has been in enjoying the property where sightings of deer raccoons opossums and birds are frequent he said.         Weve loved every minute of being here said Mr. Marchese a tree consultant by trade adding that the house just minutes from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge gives him easy access to all the boroughs for his work. We have all the holidays here and the kids love it. The grandchildren come and run around this house in the trees  its like a castle for them.         Mr. Marchese says that Emerson Hill reminds him of a rustic mountain town in  Italy  and for good reason. Spread over about 150 acres the neighborhood has winding streets that in some places are too narrow for two cars to pass. Many houses are on terraced properties and perched high above the street.         Styles range from Swiss chalet English Tudor and center-hall colonial to the more contemporary; many houses have pools. In that the area is comparable to nearby Todt Hill one of Staten Islands most affluent neighborhoods. But Emerson Hill has a less manicured cultivated feel.         Residents can join a homeowners association; its fees maintain some of the landscape as well as street lamps and entrance gates at the foot of the hill. But the gates are always open Mr. Marchese said.         Theres no guard or anything like that he said. You can just drive right up. Everybodys pretty nice here.          What Youll Find   The area is a haven for professionals mostly doctors and lawyers from different ethnic backgrounds said Catherine McCarthy-Turer an agent with Stribling & Associates who as a child often stayed with a close relative in Emerson Hill. I spent the majority of my childhood there she said and its this incredibly bucolic setting thats remained really unchanged for decades.         In area it is typically seen as bounded by Clove Road or the  Staten Island  Expressway to the north and Richmond Road to the east. Of the two entrances one is on the north side at Emerson Drive the other on the east side at Douglas Road. The neighborhood consisting of those roads and several others that branch off has about 105 families according to Larry Lettera a president of the Emerson Hill Civic Association.         Douglas Road is the main road Ms. McCarthy-Turer said and you have all these sort of small little roads that jut off of that and some are hidden little treasures.        
425,100000002533643,0,Article,News,Travel,travel,,"In Rio and São Paulo, Go North",SETH KUGEL,1119,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/travel/in-rio-and-sao-paulo-go-north.html,2,It is a startlingly pleasant anomaly in the normally intimidating 11-million-person megacity of SÃ£o Paulo. On a quaint square across from a tiny 112-year-old church a bar called FrangÃ³ ( frangobar.com.br ) offers worn wooden tables in cozy nooks an astonishing 500-label beer list and a celebrated version of the popular Brazilian chicken croquettes called  coxinhas .         Yet when my pal Oliver texted a friend to join us the response was curt and dismissive: I generally dont frequent those parts of the city.         Those parts means the Zona Norte or North Zone roughly the regions of SÃ£o Paulo north of the filthy TietÃª River generally ignored by tourists and wealthier residents who haunt restaurants and bars in the tonier south and west. But in my opinion the distaste is mainly an issue of misperception: the north southerners feel is not interesting enough (untrue) too far (easy enough to get to by a combination of subway and bus or short cab ride) too dangerous (not if you take basic precautions and southern zones are far from immune).         Theres a parallel geography at work in Brazils second biggest city Rio de Janeiro where the Zona Norte is largely ignored in favor of Zona Sul home to the Copacabana and Ipanema neighborhoods with their famous beaches and luxurious hotels. (Once-downtrodden downtowns in both cities are also being revived drawing more tourists.)         Yet in my traveling calculus any place with millions of residents must have something worth doing. Whats more in two cities where the prices in more upscale neighborhoods typically leave visitors shellshocked options are more affordable. So on a recent trip through Brazil I set out to the north  and found plenty of good food cultural charm great views and yes even beaches.          Rio de Janeiro   Denizens of Rios Zona Sul cannot entirely ignore the north: theyd never attend a soccer game at MaracanÃ£ the stadium that will host the 2014 World Cup final next year or watch the citys samba schools put on their exuberant parades in the Sambadrome.         But the Zona Norte has much more to offer. Those same samba schools hold weekly rehearsals  festive dance parties featuring the schools bands  and many of the most famous like Mangueira are in poor neighborhoods in the north. Even more elaborate fun can be found on a 24-hour clock on weekends at the arena-sized SÃ£o CristÃ³vÃ£o fair ( feiradesaocristovao.org.br ) with foods and live music from Brazils distinct northeastern region.         Even on a Monday when I arrived in town the parties dont stop. I waited in line at the RenascenÃ§a Clube ( renaclube.com.br ) a traditionally black social club for its weekly Workers Samba which began as an informal gathering of musicians on their day off. The group still sits around a table playing guitars singing drumming out the beat on tamborims and surdos surrounded by hundreds of Brazilians who pay a bargain 10 reais (about $4.60 at 2.18 reais to the dollar) to crowd into a sprawling outdoor space.         There is plenty of dancing but the crowd seems happy to spend the time talking singing drinking and eating (the fare tends toward heavy but affordable heaping plates of classics like linguiÃ§a sausage covered in onions 15 reais). I found the crowd friendly and diverse (I met both street cleaners and a professor of geography).         Beaches in the north could not be more different from Ipanema. Before visiting the club I had spent most of the day on the Ilha de PaquetÃ¡ an island in Guanabara Bay easily accessible by a 45-minute 4.50-reais ferry from downtown. (Although PaquetÃ¡ is officially administered by the downtown Zona Central it is actually the northernmost point in the city.)         And while Ipanemas streets are lined with fancy high-rises boutiques and restaurants Paquetas dirt roads which are car-free (horse-drawn carriages cart visitors around town) feature 19th-century homes stores that rent banged-up bicycles (5 reais an hour) and diners that offer up simple pleasures like fried fish or grilled ham and cheese.         The crowds too are different. On the ferry to PaquetÃ¡ I sat in front of a nun who worked as a nurse at a hospital recently visited by the pope (I kissed him twice she told me excitedly). I later spotted her on the beach; nuns are not frequently spotted amid the toned bodies of Ipanema. Neither are battered swan boats rentable for 20 reais per half-hour. The backdrop however  mountains in the distance mesmerizing rock formations just offshore  is the same.          SÃ£o Paulo   This vast sprawling city is a sea of high-rises that can seem never-ending. But on clear days a mountain range called the Serra da Cantareira appears far to the north. It is one of the scattered remaining parts of the Atlantic Forest the partly tropical biome that once covered vast swaths of coastal Brazil. And part of it is within the Zona Norte.         The primary attraction (9 reais to enter) is the area around Pedra Grande or Big Rock. At its namesake attraction a two-mile hike up a rutted road from the entrance you hop up onto the expansive sloping surface to take in the view. The forest spreads out below and then suddenly breaks into a mind-boggling infinity of urban towers that stretches almost to the horizon. Or take one of the narrower trails closer to the Pedra Grande entrance and the city disappears entirely leaving you amid great fig trees draped with vines and monkeys calling from above.         More civilized is MocotÃ³ ( mocoto.com.br ) a top-rated SÃ£o Paulo restaurant that is rare for both its affordability and its ability to attract southerners to the North Zone. Rodrigo Oliveira the chef who took over his fathers traditional neighborhood restaurant and updated it to great acclaim  now tours the world . But despite endless offers from investors he stubbornly refuses to leave Vila Medeiros the working-class Zona Norte neighborhood where he grew up. And so the moneyed class comes to him as a sort of a daring urban adventure.         Prices have gone up a bit as buzz has grown but skip the most expensive dishes (though not the caipirinha cocktail of the day 12.90 reais) and a meal can be had for about 50 reais. Mr. Oliveiras version of escondidinho shredded dried beef hidden under a layer of purÃ©ed manioc root au gratin is flawless. And virtually no one skips the tapioca dice cubes of tapioca with coalho cheese fried and served with sweet-sour chile sauce.         Earlier this year Mr. Oliveira opened up  Esquina MocotÃ³  a pricier fancier restaurant next door. Would he ever consider expanding farther south? MocotÃ³ is 40 years old he said. We just opened Esquina MocotÃ³ next door. Maybe in another 40 years well open one in the South Zone. Maybe.                Also in Video »       
426,100000002534721,0,Article,News,Books,books,review,What Would Aldous Huxley Make of the Way We Consume Media and Popular Culture?,ADAM KIRSCH;JENNIFER SZALAI,1512,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/what-would-aldous-huxley-make-of-the-way-we-consume-media-and-popular-culture.html,59,Each week in Bookends two writers take on pressing and provocative questions about the world of books. This week Adam Kirsch and Jennifer Szalai on the prescience  or lack thereof  of the Brave New World author who died 50 years ago this month.          By Adam Kirsch    Huxleys predictions about sexual freedom have largely come true  but Brave New World was wrong about the essentials.   I fully expect that I will get to go to the feelies before I die. The feelies as readers of Aldous Huxleys Brave New World will remember are movies taken to the next level: you sit in a seat equipped with special knobs and when you grasp them the sensations of the characters on-screen are transmitted to your own nerve endings. If as seems likely the most popular application of feelies turns out to be pornography that would not have surprised Huxley in the slightest. Indeed in Brave New World the hero  a noble savage named John who is the readers scout in ultramodern London  goes to a feely called Three Weeks in a Helicopter which seems to consist of nothing but a pair of lovers having sex in as promised a helicopter: The stereoscopic lips came together again and once more the facial erogenous zones of the 6000 spectators in the Alhambra tingled with almost intolerable galvanic pleasure.         Pornography however is a term that would have no meaning in Huxleys World State  or rather its meaning would be the reverse of the one it has now. This is in keeping with the sexual topsy-turviness of Huxleys dystopia which turns all our taboos inside out. In Brave New World the most obscene word the one that has the power to make people blush and flee the room is mother. The most antisocial sexual behavior is monogamy and a man is a perfect gentleman if he refrains from paying too much attention to any particular one of the women hes sleeping with. All this is because in Huxleys meticulously imagined future the cardinal virtue is satisfying your appetites and the worst vice is repression.         When we talk about Brave New World we usually have in mind the novels vision of a society stratified by scientific means into predestined castes  the handsome intelligent Alphas lording it over the moronic undersized Epsilons. But the truth is that the novels understanding of embryology and its crudely behavioristic ideas of conditioning are both badly dated. The more we learn about human nature the clearer it becomes that it cant be manipulated as straightforwardly as Huxley imagined.         What has come true in Brave New World to a much larger extent is the liberation of sexuality. If you compare our generation to Huxleys theres no doubt that we listen to more explicitly erotic music wear more revealing clothing form and break sexual attachments much more casually and teach our children to be free from sexual shame  all things he predicted queasily in his novel. There may not yet be a musical instrument called a sexophone but the Internet has done more to make sexual images and sex itself available than anything Huxley imagined.         For Huxley who was born when Queen Victoria was on the throne sexual freedom was inevitably going to translate into emotional shallowness. Without sublimation there is no culture: That is the Freudian premise of Brave New World. If today Huxleys novel often feels snobbish and reactionary it is because we have survived the great change and found ourselves not so degraded as Huxley expected. Yes we live in a time of commodified sexuality of pornography on demand and of many kinds of vulgarity; Huxley transported to the year 2013 would smile grimly.         But Brave New World was wrong about the essentials. People still seek intimacy and even monogamy but on a new basis; sexual freedom has given our relationships more dignity because they are based on choice and not frustrated need. Nor has the weakening of repression stopped us from cherishing art science and the ideal. Human nature in this as in other respects is not so malleable as Huxley thought. Brave New World makes the illiberal assumption that giving people more freedom and less authority will degrade them. The challenge the book sets us today is to prove him wrong.         
427,100000002533523,0,Article,News,Magazine,magazine,,Outsource Your Way to Success,CATHERINE RAMPELL,1194,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/magazine/outsource-your-way-to-success.html,18,Jon Steinsson and Emi Nakamura do not have enough time to do everything they need to do. Theyre recently tenured highly productive rising stars at Columbia University as well as parents to an infant. But they have a secret weapon helping them prioritize: Econ 101.         Deep thoughts this week: 1.  Outsourcing isnt just for corporations. 2.  Comparative advantage exists for people too. 3.  Your boss will thank you. 4.  And so will your kids. One of the oldest if not entirely intuitive principles in economics is comparative advantage developed by the British economist David Ricardo in the early 19th century. As introductory econ students all learn it explains why countries and companies ought to outsource the production of lower-value goods and services even if they can produce them more efficiently themselves.         Even if youre faster and more effective than everyone else at a given task  fighting with the cable company say or folding your socks just so  you still might be better off if you pay someone else to do it for you. Why? Because there is an opportunity cost for every hour consumed by these tedious nonproductive tasks; there exists some higher-value activity you could be spending your time on instead.         Steinsson and Nakamura both economists take the tenets of their field seriously. And so they outsource as much of the humdrum aspects of their personal lives as they can.         Last year the couple hired a personal chef. She drops off five healthful meals at the beginning of every week to reduce the time they spend cooking (they used to cook recreationally; now theyd rather spend that time with their son). They have also paid people to: build Ikea furniture for them (even though the service often costs more than the furniture itself); teach them how to use software programs and baby carriers; and load their CD collection onto their computers. They even hired someone to spend hours going through thousands of old family photographs to figure out which are the good ones.         That last task has proved a bit problematic. Its hard for a stranger to look at snapshots from your childhood and determine which ones represent truly memorable moments. Still Steinsson remains confident in the theory. We havent figured it out yet but we havent given up he told me.         While its now common especially in cities like New York for professionals to hire a housekeeper and pay for some degree of child care outsourcing other activities is quite rare and even stigmatized among noneconomists. Embracing the D.I.Y. ethos is (wrongly) perceived as evidence of thrift or even moral virtue. A personal chef is the sort of luxury people associate with hedge-funders Europeans with several surnames and oil sheikhs. Still you need not be an heiress to benefit from paying for a personal assistant or gofer of some kind. From an economists perspective its similar to taking out student loans: an investment in your future earning potential. Yet few outside the field see it that way.         Part of the problem is that most people dont understand the value of their time particularly if they are salaried. Paying someone to buy your groceries or take the car to the mechanic sounds like money down the drain if youre not billing hourly. But buying yourself an extra hour to work today can be good for your career tomorrow if doing so improves your chances of getting a promotion or a raise.         Thats why Steinsson and Nakamura paid for housekeeping services even when they were penniless grad students. Outsourcing household tasks meant they had to take on more debt but they calculated  correctly  that spending an extra hour working on a paper was better for their lifetime expected earnings than spending that same hour vacuuming.         There is also a strong cultural aversion to certain forms of outsourcing. Hiring people to work essentially as servants smacks of classism or insufficient self-reliance. Scrubbing your own toilet or doing your own laundry supposedly builds character or something to that effect. And while its certainly good to have these skills in a pinch its probably not a wise financial decision to use them all the time if you could instead be engaging in other activities that improve your  and your familys  well-being.

428,100000002527380,0,Article,News,Books,books,review,Inside the List,GREGORY COWLES,490,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/inside-the-list.html,54, Nothing Fancy:  Wally Lambs fifth novel We Are Water  about a dysfunctional family coming together for a same-sex wedding  enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 4. Lamb was one of the early winners of the Oprah Winfrey sweepstakes; he vaulted onto the list in 1997 when his debut Shes Come Undone was chosen for her book club and all of his novels since have also been best sellers.         Along the way readers have gotten to know the modest corner of southeastern Connecticut where much of Lambs work takes place. I often write a fictional version of my hometown of Norwich he told the student newspaper at St. Josephs University in Philadelphia last month. Eastern Connecticut is largely influenced by Boston: youll find were mostly Red Sox fans instead of Yankee fans. . . . We use the word wicked as an adverb. That is the Connecticut I write about because its what I know. Most people think of the fancy parts  Westport Greenwich country clubs  but thats not the Connecticut I know.          You Are Getting Sleepy:  When the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer appeared on NPRs Morning Edition recently to promote his collection Things That Matter new at No. 4 on the hardcover nonfiction list he had an amusing exchange with the host Steve Inskeep about his early career as a psychiatrist. When I was at Mass General Krauthammer said I learned to do hypnosis believe it or not.         I would think you could have used that hypnosis technique when youre on television Inskeep replied. That could be a very effective thing to do to people.         Thats exactly what Ive been doing for the last 10 years Krauthammer told him.         And I didnt even know Inskeep said. Apparently it worked.          Ghost Writer:  Im not from Long Island I dont speak to dead people and I havent bought hair spray since 1984. Thats Kristina Grish near the end of Theres More to Life Than This explaining the hurdles she faced in writing a book with the popular TV spiritualist Theresa Caputo. Considering that Caputos show is called Long Island Medium and that she wears her hair like Ziggy Stardust you can see the problem. (Not that its hurt their collaboration any; after four weeks on the advice how-to and miscellaneous list the book remains at No. 4.) Grish is entertaining about what it was like to be Caputos ghostwriter  for one thing she says both she and her more skeptical husband began to believe spirits were visiting their house. I wondered if my imagination was running wild because I was so close to the material she writes but then our dog Izzy started to act strange. The visitations stopped once the book was done. The best comparison I can make is when your home is really dusty and you dont even realize it until after you vacuum and the air feels so much clearer and lighter.        
429,100000002542679,0,Article,News,World,world,europe,Germany Looks Back on Pogroms and Saviors,ALISON SMALE,690,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/09/world/europe/09iht-germany09.html,,BERLIN   Germany s president opened a weekend of commemoration on Friday with a quiet visit to a simple museum dedicated to a Berlin manufacturer who in a similar if smaller way than the better-known Oskar Schindler saved Jews from the Nazis. The actions of Otto Weidt the president noted showed that everyone always has a choice about how to act in the face of evil.         The visit by President Joachim Gauck came on the eve of Nov. 9  the date on which in 1938 the Nazis killed beat and rounded up thousands of Jews in pogroms and destroyed or damaged hundreds of synagogues but also the anniversary of the joyous fall of the  Berlin Wall  in 1989.         Anniversaries count in Europe and nowhere more so than in the German capital where the past is still very much present.         This year the Wall memorials will undoubtedly be more modest than next year the 25th anniversary. By contrast many Jewish luminaries  including the new chief rabbi of Israel and some 200 rabbis from all over Europe  are gathering in Berlin this weekend for the 75th anniversary of what the Nazis called Reichskristallnacht after the shimmering flames and sun on the glass of destroyed Jewish places of worship and commerce.         Among the visitors is Ronald S. Lauder president of the World Jewish Congress who in an interview said it was important to remember that it was the events of Nov. 9 1938 that gave Hitler confidence that he could act with impunity against the Jews.         It was the worlds lack of response that sealed the fate for the Jews in Europe noted Mr. Lauder who also noted the coincidence of the anniversary with this weeks spectacular find of some 1400 artworks that he said were almost certainly looted in part from Jews either killed or driven out by the Nazis. The artworks he said are the last prisoners.         Mr. Lauder is a well-known art collector and founder of the Neue Galerie in New York. Asked how he could be so certain that a sizeable slice of the cache had belonged to Jews he referred to extensive research by the Commission for Art Recovery which was founded in 1997 and over which he presides.         Some heirs of Jewish and other collectors who believe the discovery may contain works they have long sought have criticized the Germans for not publishing a full list and for keeping quiet about the cache since it came to light during a police and customs raid on a Munich apartment in Feb. 2012.         Mr. Lauder said he thought the German government was trying to figure out what they have and how to handle it.         My belief is at the end of the day they will handle it 100 percent correctly he said. They gain nothing by doing anything else.         Mr. Gauck who was a pastor in Communist East Germany toured the Berlin museum commemorating Mr. Weidt a brush manufacturer who employed blind Jews and others together with Inge Deutschkron now 90 who was one of the Jews hidden by Mr. Heidt and his wife and who thus survived Second World War.         Often our powers of decision are limited in some way or rendered impossible Mr. Gauck wrote in the visitors book. The man we get to know here did not like the word impossible. He did more than the possible. We have a choice.         Chancellor Angela Merkel like Mr. Gauck raised in East Germany marked the pogroms anniversary last weekend in an interview with Samuel Vingron a senior at a Jewish high school in Berlin. It was one of the darkest moments in German history she noted in contrast to the joy and great hope generated on Nov. 9 1989.         Mr. Gauck dwelled on the theme of individual choice. In the small museum in what is now a graffiti-sprayed courtyard in the heart of newly trendy Mitte or central Berlin you can practically feel the way simple onlookers people who assisted evil and perpetrators lurked all around in the Nazi time he said. And yet he noted one man was able to create an island of humanity.

But the issue never gets much traction and one reason is the perception that it’s politically hopeless: Republicans would never go for such a program.  My Sunday column  tries to push back at the assumption that it’s hopeless and notes that one of the leaders in providing pre-K in America is–not Massachusetts not New York not some other blue state but reliably red Oklahoma. It’s all the more surprising because Oklahoma spends less per pupil on education than almost any other state and pays its teachers near the bottom. This is not a state that believes in lavish spending on schooling. Yet quite remarkably it provides universal high-quality pre-K with a ratio of no more than 10 students per staff member and all teachers have a college degree. My own take is that even earlier interventions may get even more bang for the buck than pre-K for 4-year-olds and sure enough Oklahoma also invests in those including home visitation programs to coach parents on reading to toddlers and talking more to them. It also has some programs for kids 0 to 3 if they’re from disadvantaged families. These are no silver bullet to defeat poverty–there isn’t one–but there seems a recognition in Oklahoma that they work in improving school performance and life outcomes and reduce the risk that poverty will be transmitted from generation to generation. So if Oklahoma can do it why not the rest of the country? Bipartisan legislation is expected to be introduced this coming week in Congress to establish national support for pre-K programs and polling shows the idea has broad support. It’ll be an uphill struggle but I’m hoping that Congress will like Oklahoma see that this isn’t a social welfare program exactly but an investment in our children and our future. Read the column and help spread the word about the need for this legislation! And post your comments below.
433,CLI/kopJtndFyg0HQd1Efg,0,Blogs,Blog Post,Opinion,Opinion,krugman,More Notes On France-Bashing,PAUL KRUGMAN,379,http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/09/more-notes-on-france-bashing/,,First things first: France has problems. Unemployment is high especially among young people many small businesses are struggling the population is aging (although not nearly as much as in many other countries Germany very much included.) By just about any measure I can find however France looks not too bad by European standards. GDP has recovered roughly to pre-crisis levels; the budget deficit is fairly small and the medium-term debt outlook not at all scary; the long-term budget outlook is actually pretty good compared with its neighbors thanks to a higher birth rate.  Yet the country is the subject of vituperative over-the-top commentary. Here’s  The Economist  a year ago declaring France “The time bomb at the heart of Europe”. Here’s  CNN  declaring that France is in “free fall”. That CNN piece actually offers a few specifics. It argues that France faces a “yawning competitiveness gap” due to rising labor costs. Hmm. Here’s what I get from European Commission numbers comparing France with the euro area as a whole: There’s a bit of deterioration there I guess — but it’s more yawn-inspiring than yawning. CNN also declares France’s decline is best illustrated by the rapid deterioration in its foreign trade. In 1999 France sold around 7% of the world’s exports. Today the figure is just over 3% and falling fast.   Hmm.Just about every advanced country the United States very much included has a declining share of world exports (Germany is an exception); this  New York Fed research paper  notes that this decline is more or less in line with the declining share of advanced economies in world GDP as emerging nations rise and it portrays France as more or less typical. Again the point is not that France is problem-free; the question is why this only moderately troubled nation attracts rating downgrades and so much apocalyptic rhetoric. And the answer just has to be politics. France’s sin isn’t excessive debt especially poor growth lousy productivity (it has more or less matched Germany since 2000) poor job growth (ditto) or anything like that. Its sin is that of balancing its budget by raising taxes instead of slashing benefits. There’s no evidence that this is a disastrous policy — and in fact bond markets don’t seem concerned — but who needs evidence?

Those who follow these things probably noticed that just a few weeks ago the austerians — Olli Rehn in particular but many others too — were hailing signs of a bit of economic growth this quarter as vindication of their policies for the past four years. Yes it was silly — I mean I could keep hitting myself in the head then slow the pace of the punishmentand I would start to feel better. Does this mean that hitting myself in the head was good for me? Still there it was. But then the ECB took a look at more relevant indicators:  unemployment still rising  core inflation  dropping below 1 percent  (Japan here we come). And it seems to have gotten very worried. Put it this way: the ECB wouldn’t be slashing rates if it thought Europe had turned the corner.
