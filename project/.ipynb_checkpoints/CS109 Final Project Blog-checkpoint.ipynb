We don't have a lot of awesome metadata though with which to make our predictions, so I got to thinking about what sorts of things might be predictable by really low-level information.  Like word length, and article length.\n",

      "<br />\n",
      "So I think that if people say less when they're emotional (and say more when they're disengaged and just listening to the sound of their own voice), they're probably going to write that way, too.\n",

If they are, then we should see that show up in the articles, too.  But I don't think that'd be much of a prediction - more just a confirmatory observation.  So really there is no Hypothesis 4.\n",

      "<br />\n",
      "In short, I was doing something wrong, and now our results are more awesome.\n",
      "<br /><br />\n",
      "I had been correlating our predictors (word length, article length) with average sentiment scores per article.  But I wasn't thinking about what that really meant.  A positive correlation means that when one variable goes up, another one goes up with it.  So by correlating, say, word length and sentiment, to find a positive correlation would mean that as word length increases, the sentiment score would increase as well.  \n",
      "<br />\n",
      "But that's not what we're interested in, at least not at first.  Our prediction outcome involved average sentiment going from low-valence (ie. neutral sentiment) to high-valence (ie. fired up, in either a positive or negative direction).  But the sentiment score itself goes from 1 (very negative sentiment) to 10 (very positive sentiment).  So if word length and sentiment had a positive relationship, that would mean that as words go from short to long, they go from angry to happy.  Which, to be fair, is something we were curious about.  But the first prediction had to do with neutral versus extreme emotional content.  That is NOT what our correlation was measuring.\n",
      "<br />\n",
      "Instead, we basically want a sentiment scoring system that starts in the middle (dead neutral, no emotion) and moves out from there (to some strong emotion, although we don't care which one).  I reorganized the sentiment scores accordingly, by creating a vector of z-scores, and then taking their absolute values.  \n",
      "<br />\n",
      "A z-score (just as a quick stats refresher) is a measure of how many standard deviations a given data point lies away from the mean.  So if mean sentiment is 5, and the standard deviation is 1.5, then a data point with sentiment score 6.5 would score a 1.0 on this scale.  Conversely, a data point with sentiment of 3.5 would score -1.0 on this scale.  But if we're just interested in going from weak to strong emotion, we don't care so much about negative or positive at this point.  So we can take the absolute value of z-scores, so they're all heading positively away from zero.\n",
      "<br />\n",
