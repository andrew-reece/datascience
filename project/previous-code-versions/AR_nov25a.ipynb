The film, written by Matthew Vaughn, Jane Goldman and Peter Straughan, is interested in the ways that the truth of the past can be shaded and illuminated by the imperatives of the present, and it probes, with perhaps more energy than clarity, the ethical and psychological complications that can lie hidden beneath a story of simple heroism. In this case the official, heroic story has to do with what happened in cold war Berlin, where three Mossad operatives went on a secret mission to capture a Nazi fugitive named Dieter Vogel. Their daring, widely celebrated exploits become the subject of a book written in 1997 by Sarah Gold (Romi Aboulafia), the daughter of two of the agents: Rachel Singer (Helen Mirren) and her ex-husband, Stephan Gold (Tom Wilkinson). Rachel, particularly, has been lionized for the courage she displayed in her younger days. She not only had the nerve to entrap her diabolical quarry, a Mengele-like doctor whose gruesome nickname was the Surgeon of Birkenau, but she also had the presence of mind to shoot him dead when he tried to escape.\", \"Been there, spent that. It took two Columbia graduates who were up to their eyeballs in credit card bills to write ''Debt-Free by 30: Practical Advice for the Young, Broke and Upwardly Mobile,'' just published by Plume ($12). ''The book is for people who think that the fifth floor at Barneys is their birthright,'' said Jason Anthony, who wrote ''Debt Free'' with Karl Cluck. As they see it, the problem is that 20-somethings were brought up to spend lavishly. ''In the 80's, when you saw the rich and fabulous on television, it was 'Dallas,' and they were in their 50's,'' Mr. Anthony said. ''For us, it was 'Beverly Hills 90210,' and people said, 'Well, why can't I have what Tori Spelling has?' ''\", nan, \"What we have is what we have. We have to rely on the money that we're bringing in. LISA MERHAUT, of Leesburg, Va., on her family's effort to cut its credit card debt. [A1]\", \"The term ''globalization'' is so tinged with rosy one-world optimism that it's easy to assume the essential benignity of an economic philosophy whose name vaguely connotes unity, equality and freedom. But as Stephanie Black's powerful documentary ''Life and Debt'' illustrates with an impressive (and depressing) acuity, globalization can have a devastating impact on third world countries. The movie offers the clearest analysis of globalization and its negative effects that I've ever seen on a movie or television screen. ''Life and Debt,'' which opens the Human Rights Watch Film Festival this evening at the Walter Reade Theater and continues its run on Saturday at Cinema Village, focuses on the deeply troubled economy of Jamaica and how that country's long-term indebtedness to international lending organizations have contributed to the erosion of local agriculture and industry.\"]\n"
