When the anthropologist Sarah B. Hrdy  Science has come a long way since then as Dr. Hrdy notes in her introduction to a recent issue of  The existence of female competition may seem obvious to anyone who has been in a high-school cafeteria or a singles bar but analyzing it has been difficult because it tends be more subtle and indirect (and a lot less violent) than the male variety. Now that researchers have been looking more closely they say that this intrasexual competition is the most important factor explaining the pressures that young women feel to meet standards of sexual conduct and physical appearance.         The old doubts about female competitiveness derived partly from an evolutionary analysis of the reproductive odds in ancient  But even in those societies women were not passive trophies for victorious males. They had their own incentives to compete with one another for more desirable partners and more resources for their children. And now that most people live in monogamous societies most women face the same odds as men. In fact they face tougher odds in some places like the many college campuses with more women than men.         To see how female students react to a rival researchers brought pairs of them into a laboratory at McMaster University for what was ostensibly a discussion about female friendships. But the real experiment began when another young woman entered the room asking where to find one of the researchers.         This woman had been chosen by the researchers  In jeans she  They stared at her looked her up and down rolled their eyes and sometimes showed outright anger. One asked her in disgust What the [expletive] is that?         Most of the aggression though happened after she left the room. Then the students laughed about her and impugned her motives. One student suggested that she dressed that way in order to have sex with a professor. Another said that her breasts were about to pop out.         The results of the experiment jibe with evidence that this mean girl form of indirect aggression is used more by adolescents and young women than by older women who have less incentive to handicap rivals once they marry. Other studies have shown that the more attractive an adolescent girl or woman is the more likely she is to become  Women are indeed very capable of aggressing against others especially women they perceive as rivals said Dr. Vaillancourt now a psychologist at the University of Ottawa. The research also shows that suppression of female sexuality is by women not necessarily by men.         Stigmatizing female promiscuity  a.k.a. slut-shaming  has often been blamed on men who have a Darwinian incentive to discourage their spouses from straying. But they also have a Darwinian incentive to encourage other women to be promiscuous. Dr. Vaillancourt said the experiment and other research suggest  Sex is coveted by men she said. Accordingly women limit access as a way of maintaining advantage in the negotiation of this resource. Women who make sex too readily available compromise the power-holding position of the group which is why many women are particularly intolerant of women who are or seem to be promiscuous.         Indirect aggression can take a psychological toll on women who are ostracized or feel pressured to meet impossible standards like the vogue of thin bodies in many modern societies. Studies have shown that womens ideal body shape is to be thinner than average  and thinner than what men consider the ideal shape to be. This pressure is frequently blamed on the ultrathin female role models featured in magazines and on television but Christopher J. Ferguson and other researchers say that its mainly  To a large degree the media reflects trends that are going on in society not creates them said  But he found that women were more likely to feel worse when they compared themselves with peers in their own social circles or even if they were in a room with a thin stranger like the assistant to Dr. Ferguson who ran  Sexual competition among females seems to increase due to circumstances that tend to be particularly common in affluent societies Dr. Ferguson said.         In traditional villages people married at an early age to someone nearby but young men and women in modern societies are free to postpone marriage as they search long and far for better options. The result is more competition because there are so many more rivals  and theres no longer any scientific doubt that both sexes are in to win it.

But instead of neatly clarifying human evolution the finding is adding new mysteries.         In a paper in the journal Nature scientists  The fossil a thigh bone found in Spain had previously seemed to many experts to belong to a forerunner of Neanderthals. But its DNA tells a very different story. It most closely resembles DNA from an enigmatic lineage of humans known as Denisovans. Until now Denisovans were known only from DNA retrieved from 80000-year-old remains in Siberia 4000 miles east of where the new DNA was found.         The mismatch between the anatomical and genetic evidence surprised the scientists who are now rethinking human evolution over the past few hundred thousand years. It is possible for example that there are many extinct human populations that scientists have yet to discover. They might have interbred swapping DNA. Scientists hope that further studies of extremely ancient human DNA will clarify the mystery.         Right now weve basically generated a big question mark said Matthias Meyer a geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig Germany and a co-author of the new study.         Hints at new hidden complexities in the human story came from a 400000-year-old femur found in a cave in Spain called Sima de los Huesos (the pit of bones in Spanish). The scientific team used new methods to extract the ancient DNA from the fossil.         This would not have been possible even a year ago said Juan Luis Arsuaga a paleoanthropologist at Universidad Complutense de Madrid and a co-author of the paper.         Finding such ancient human DNA was a major advance said David Reich a geneticist at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the research. Thats an amazing game-changing thing he said.         Since the 1970s Spanish scientists have brought out a wealth of fossils from the cave dating back hundreds of thousands of years. The place is very special said Dr. Arsuaga who has found 28 nearly complete skeletons of humans during three decades of excavations.         Based on the anatomy of the fossils Dr. Arsuaga has argued that they belonged to ancestors of Neanderthals which lived in western Asia and Europe from about 200000 to 30000 years ago.         When Dr. Meyer and his colleagues drilled into the femur they found ancient human DNA inside just as they had hoped.         Our expectation was that it would be a very early Neanderthal Dr. Meyer said.         But the DNA did not match that of Neanderthals. Dr. Meyer then compared it to the DNA of the Denisovans the ancient human lineage that he and his colleagues had discovered in Siberia in 2010. He was shocked to find that it was similar.         Everybody had a hard time believing it at first Dr. Meyer said. So we generated more and more data to nail it down.         The extra research confirmed that the DNA belonged on the Denisovan branch of the human family tree.         The new finding is hard to reconcile with the picture of human evolution that has been emerging based on fossils and ancient DNA. Denisovans were believed to be limited to East Asia and they were not thought to look so Neanderthal-like.         Based on previously discovered ancient DNA and fossil evidence scientists generally agreed that humans direct ancestors shared a common ancestor with Neanderthals and Denisovans that lived about half a million years ago in Africa.         Their shared ancestors split off from humans lineage and left Africa then split further into the Denisovans and Neanderthals about 300000 years ago. The evidence suggested that Neanderthals headed west toward Europe and that the Denisovans moved east.         Humans ancestors meanwhile stayed in Africa giving rise to Homo sapiens about 200000 years ago. Humans then expanded from Africa into Asia and Europe about 60000 years ago. They then interbred not only with Neanderthals but with Denisovans too. Later both the Denisovans and Neanderthals became extinct.         Now we have to rethink the whole story Dr. Arsuaga said.         Dr. Arsuaga doubts that Denisovans were spread out across so much of the Old World from Spain to Siberia masquerading as Neanderthals.         One alternative explanation is that the humans of Sima de los Huesos were not true Neanderthals but belonged to the ancestors of both Denisovans and Neanderthals.         It is also possible that the newly discovered DNA was passed to both Neanderthals and Denisovans but eventually disappeared from Neanderthals replaced by other variants.         It got lost in one lineage but made its way in the other suggested Jean-Jacques Hublin a Max Planck paleoanthropologist who was not involved in the research.         Beth Shapiro an expert on ancient DNA at the University of California Santa Cruz favors an even more radical possibility: that the humans of Sima de los Huesos belong to yet another branch of humans. They might have been a species called Homo erectus which originated about 1.8 million years ago and became extinct within the last few hundred thousand years.         The more we learn from the DNA extracted from these fossils the more complicated the story becomes Dr. Shapiro said.         This complicated story has come to light only because of advances over the past 20 years in retrieving ancient DNA.         When an organism dies its DNA breaks down into smaller and smaller fragments while also becoming contaminated with the DNA of other species like soil bacteria. So piecing the fossil DNA together is a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle created by a sadist.         In 1997 Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute and his colleagues who had pioneered the techniques for retrieving DNA fragments  In 2006 a team of French and Belgian researchers obtained a fragment of Neanderthal DNA dating back  Meanwhile using improved methods Dr. Paabo Dr. Meyer and their colleagues  That discovery shed light on how Neanderthals and humans ancestors split from a common ancestor hundreds of thousands of years ago. It also revealed that Neanderthals and humans interbred  Around the same time as that discovery Russian collaborators sent the Max Planck team 80000-year-old fossils they had found in a cave in Siberia called Denisova. When the German scientists sequenced the entire genome from the finger bone of a girl it turned out to be neither human nor Neanderthal but from a  Dr. Meyer is hopeful that he and his colleagues will be able to get more DNA from the Spanish fossil as well as other fossils from the site to help solve the puzzle they have now stumbled across. Its extremely hard to make sense of Dr. Meyer said. We still are a bit lost here.        
2,100000002555962,1,Article,News,World,world,europe,A Russian GPS Using U.S. Soil Stirs Spy Fears,MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT;ERIC SCHMITT,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/world/europe/a-russian-gps-using-us-soil-stirs-spy-fears.html,1,WASHINGTON  In the view of Americas spy services the next potential threat from  Instead this menace may come in the form of a seemingly innocuous dome-topped antenna perched atop an electronics-packed building surrounded by a security fence somewhere in the United States.         In recent months the  They fear that these structures could help Russia spy on the United States and improve the precision of Russian weaponry the officials said. These monitor stations the Russians contend would significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of Moscows version of the Global Positioning System the American satellite network that steers guided missiles to their targets and thirsty smartphone users to the nearest Starbucks.         They dont want to be reliant on the American system and believe that their systems like GPS will spawn other industries and applications said a former senior official in the State Departments Office of Space and Advanced Technology. They feel as though they are losing a technological edge to us in an important market. Look at everything GPS has done on things like your phone and the movement of planes and ships.         The Russian effort is part of a larger global race by several countries  including China and European Union nations  to perfect their own global positioning systems and challenge the dominance of the American GPS.         For the State Department permitting Russia to build the stations would help mend the Obama administrations relationship with the government of President Vladimir V. Putin now at a nadir because of Moscows granting asylum to Mr. Snowden and its backing of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.         But the C.I.A. and other American spy agencies as well as the Pentagon suspect that the monitor stations would give the Russians a foothold on American territory that would sharpen the accuracy of Moscows satellite-steered weapons. The stations they believe could also give the Russians an opening to snoop on the United States within its borders.         The squabble is serious enough that administration officials have delayed a final decision until the Russians provide more information and until the American agencies sort out their differences State Department and White House officials said.         Russias efforts have also stirred concerns on Capitol Hill where members of the intelligence and armed services committees view Moscows global positioning network  known as Glonass for Global Navigation Satellite System  with deep suspicion and are demanding answers from the administration.         I would like to understand why the United States would be interested in enabling a GPS competitor like Russian Glonass when the worlds reliance on GPS is a clear advantage to the United States on multiple levels said Representative Mike D. Rogers Republican of Alabama the chairman of a House Armed Services subcommittee.         Mr. Rogers last week asked the Pentagon to provide an assessment of the proposals impact on national security. The request was made in a letter sent to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel Secretary of State John Kerry and the director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr.         The monitor stations have been a high priority of Mr. Putin for several years as a means to improve Glonass not only to benefit the Russian military and civilian sectors but also to compete globally with GPS.         Earlier this year Russia positioned a station in Brazil and agreements with Spain Indonesia and Australia are expected soon according to Russian news reports. The United States has stations around the world but none in Russia.        
3,100000002579524,1,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Focus Turns to Investigation in Fatal Bronx Train Crash,JAMES BARRON;J. DAVID GOODMAN,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/nyregion/metro-north-derailment.html,1,The 5:54 from Poughkeepsie was rumbling through the Bronx on Sunday morning. Only 100 to 150 people were onboard  department store employees who were bracing for another busy after-Thanksgiving day tourists from Texas who wanted to climb the Statue of Liberty a police officer moonlighting as a security guard on his day off.         Some were dozing when the train rounded a bend near where tracks pass under the Henry Hudson Bridge. Some were listening to music on headphones. Suddenly with a jerk that disrupted the steady trains steady rhythm their world turned upside down as they were hurled from one side to the other.         In the chaos of screeching metal and the shower of debris as the train kept plowing along some passengers grabbed for the luggage racks and held on. Others hugged their seats as the eight cars of the train flew off the tracks and several landed on their sides.         Im thinking Im going into the water said Eddie Russell 48 who had been listening with his eyes closed to LL Cool J. I was thinking of me surviving.         Police and transit officials said four people on board were killed and more than 60 were injured 11 critically. Three of the four dead were thrown from the train after the windows blew out the officials said.         It was not clear how fast the Metro-North train was going. But an official from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the train operator had reported that the train was going into the turn too fast and that he had performed an emergency braking maneuver.         The operator told the first rescuers to reach the scene that he had dumped the brakes according to the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.         Dumping the brakes railroad experts said is a last-resort move that has the effect of slamming on the emergency brakes on all the cars of a train at once. It is usually done to avert a collision with another train or a vehicle at a grade-level crossing.         Officials opened an investigation but cautioned that it would take time to piece together the evidence and identify a possible cause. The National Transportation Safety Board sent investigators to the site with instructions to inspect the overturned cars and interpret information from the trains event recorders devices that are somewhat similar to the flight recorders on airplanes. The Federal Railroad Administration also dispatched a team of investigators.         Earl F. Weener of the transportation safety board said at a morning news conference with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo that investigators had yet to interview the operator of the train who was among those injured. A spokeswoman for Metro-North said the engineer identified as William Rockefeller of Germantown N.Y. had about 14 years experience with the line. There were also three conductors on the train.         Our mission is to not just understand what happened but why it happened with the intent of preventing it from happening again Mr. Weener said.         The accident was the latest episode in a trying year for Metro-North the nations second-largest commuter railroad and the first with passenger fatalities in Metro-Norths 30-year history.         In May two Metro-North trains slammed into each other near Fairfield Conn. during the evening rush. Scores of passengers were hurt five critically.         And in July a CSX freight train derailed near where the Metro-North train left the tracks on Sunday. Officials said there was no connection between the accidents.         By Sunday night the transportation safety board had given Metro-North clearance to begin removing the crippled train and repairing the tracks. But the crash was likely to disrupt the Monday commute for thousands of passengers on the railroads Hudson line. Metro-North arranged for buses to take Hudson line passengers to White Plains N.Y. on Sunday to catch trains on a different line that was running normally. On Monday Hudson line trains will be running as far south as Yonkers where passengers will be able to catch buses to the 242nd Street station of the No. 1 train.

Doctors say it has enormous potential to save babies in poor countries and perhaps to reduce  This is very exciting said Dr. Mario Merialdi the W.H.O.s chief coordinator for improving maternal and perinatal health and an early champion of the OdÃ³n Device. This critical moment of life is one in which theres been very little advancement for years.         About 10 percent of the 137 million births worldwide each year have potentially serious complications Dr. Merialdi said. About 5.6 million babies are stillborn or die quickly and about 260000 women die in childbirth. Obstructed labor which can occur when a babys head is too large or an exhausted mothers contractions stop is a major factor.         In wealthy countries fetal distress results in a rush to the operating room. In poor rural clinics Dr. Merialdi said if the baby doesnt come out the woman is on her own.         The  Although more testing is planned on the OdÃ³n Device doctors said it appeared to be safe for  Along the way it has won research grants from the United States Agency for International Development and from Grand Challenges Canada. Weve given out $32 million for 61 different innovations and this one is the farthest along said Dr. Peter A. Singer the chief executive of Grand Challenges Canada.         The device will be manufactured by Becton Dickinson and Company or BD of Franklin Lakes N.J. which is better known for making syringes.         My first reaction as soon as I saw it was positive said Gary M. Cohen the companys executive vice president for global health. It was at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland that Dr. Merialdi asked him to consider taking it on.         Many inventions get to the prototype stage but thats maybe 15 percent of what needs to be done Mr. Cohen said. Theres finalizing the design for manufacture quality control the regulatory work and clinical studies. Absent that they dont see the light of day.         So far the device has been safety-tested only on 30 Argentine women all of whom were in hospitals had given birth before and were in normal labor.         I was glad they asked me because it was for a good cause said Luciana Valle a kindergarten teacher who was 31 two years ago when her son Matteo was one of the first babies extracted with the device. Because Matteo weighed almost nine pounds it really helped she said in a telephone interview. His head came out on my second push.         The W.H.O. will now oversee tests on 100 more women in normal labor in China India and South Africa and then on 170 women in obstructed labor.

Seven years ago he said employees were imitating a video showing that a cork pushed into an empty bottle can be retrieved by inserting a plastic grocery bag blowing until it surrounds the cork and drawing it out.         That night he won a dinner bet on it.         At 4 a.m. he woke his wife and told her the idea that had just come to him. (His own children were born without problems he said but he has an aunt who suffered nerve damage from birth.)         His wife he recalled said I was crazy and went back to sleep.         The next morning a somewhat skeptical friend introduced him to an obstetrician. You can imagine these two guys in suits in a waiting room full of pregnant ladies he said.         The doctor was encouraging so he kept working. Polyethylene replaced the bag his wife had sewn and the jar was replaced by a plastic uterus.         With the help of a cousin Mr. OdÃ³n met the chief of obstetrics at a major hospital in Buenos Aires. The chief had a friend at the W.H.O. who knew Dr. Merialdi who at a 2008 medical conference in Argentina granted Mr. OdÃ³n 10 minutes during a coffee break.         The meeting instead lasted two hours. At the end Dr. Merialdi declared the idea fantastic and arranged for testing at the  Since then Mr. OdÃ³n has continued to refine the device patenting each change so he will eventually earn royalties on it.         My daughter said And now I can have my doll backÂ  he said.         It is too early to know what BD will charge Mr. Cohen said but each device should cost less than $50 to make. While the company expects to profit on all sales it will charge poor countries less.

5,100000002546481,1,Article,News,Health,health,,Experts Reshape Treatment Guide for Cholesterol,GINA KOLATA,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/health/new-guidelines-redefine-use-of-statins.html,1,The nations leading heart organizations released new guidelines on Tuesday that will fundamentally reshape the use of cholesterol-lowering statin medicines which are now prescribed for a quarter of Americans over 40. Patients on statins will no longer need to lower their cholesterol levels to specific numerical targets monitored by regular blood tests as has been recommended for decades. Simply taking the right dose of a statin will be sufficient the guidelines say.         The  Everyone else should be considered for a statin if his or her risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years is at least 7.5 percent. Doctors are advised to use a  Now one in four Americans over 40 will be saying Should I be taking this anymore?  said Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Yale who was not on the guidelines committee.         The  It is not clear whether more or fewer people will end up taking the drugs under the new guidelines experts said. Many women and African-Americans who have a higher-than-average risk of stroke may find themselves candidates for treatment but others taking statins only to lower LDL cholesterol to target levels may no longer need them.         The previous guidelines put such a strong emphasis on lowering cholesterol levels by specific amounts that patients who did not hit their target levels just by taking statins often were prescribed additional drugs like Zetia made by Merck. But the new guidelines say doctors should no longer prescribe those extra medicines because they have never been shown to prevent heart attacks or strokes.         Zetia has been viewed with increasing skepticism in recent years since studies showed it lowered LDL cholesterol but did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or death. Still it is among Mercks top-selling drugs earning $2.6 billion last year. Another drug Vytorin which combines Zetia with a statin brought in $1.8 billion in 2012 according to company filings. And in May  The new guidelines are part of a package of recommendations to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke that includes moderate exercise and a healthy diet. But its advice on cholesterol is the flash point arousing the ire of critics who say the authors ignored evidence that did not come from gold-standard clinical trials and should also have counted less rigorous but compelling data.         For example Dr. Daniel J. Rader the director of the preventive cardiovascular medicine and lipid clinic at the University of Pennsylvania points to studies of people with genes giving them low LDL levels over a lifetime. Their heart attack rate is greatly reduced he said suggesting the benefits of long-term cholesterol reduction.         Committee members counter his view saying that cholesterol lowered by drugs may not have the same effect.         Critics also question the use of a 10-year risk of heart attack or stroke as the measure for determining who should be treated. Many people will have a lower risk simply because they are younger yet could benefit from taking statins for decades to keep their cholesterol levels low they say.         Dr. Rader and other experts also worry that without the goad of target numbers patients and their doctors will lose motivation to control cholesterol levels.         Experts say it is still unclear how much the new guidelines will change clinical practice. Dr. Rader suspects many cardiologists will still strive for the old LDL targets at least for patients with heart disease who are at high risk. They are used to it and believe in it he said.         Dr. Steven E. Nissen a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic said he thought it would take years for doctors to change their practices.        
6,100000002564705,1,Article,News Analysis,U.S.,us,politics,Partisan Fever in Senate Likely to Rise,JONATHAN WEISMAN,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/us/politics/a-move-years-in-the-making-with-lasting-ramifications.html,1,WASHINGTON  President Obama will get a short-term lift for his nominees judicial and otherwise but over the immediate horizon the strong-arm move by Senate Democrats on Thursday to limit filibusters could usher in an era of rank partisan warfare beyond even what Americans have seen in the past five years.         Ultimately a small group of centrists  Republicans and Democrats  could find the muscle to hold the Senate at bay until bipartisan solutions can be found. But for the foreseeable future Republicans wounded and eager to show they have not been stripped of all power are far more likely to unify against the Democrats who humiliated them in such dramatic fashion.         This is the most important and most dangerous restructuring of Senate rules since Thomas Jefferson wrote them at the beginning of our country declared Senator Lamar Alexander Republican of Tennessee. Its another raw exercise of political power to permit the majority to do whatever it wants whenever it wants to do it.         The decision to press the button on the so-called nuclear option was no doubt cathartic for a Democratic majority driven to distraction by Republican obstructionism. President Obama had predicted his re-election would break the partisan fever gripping Washington especially since the Tea Party movement swept Republicans to control of the House. It did not.         Doing nothing was no longer an option said Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico one of a new breed of Democrats who have pressed to reform Senate rules.         But the fever is hardly gone. The rule change lowered to a simple 51-vote majority the threshold to clear procedural hurdles on the way to the confirmation of judges and executive nominees. But it did nothing to streamline the gantlet that presidential nominees run. Republicans may not be able to muster the votes to block Democrats on procedure but they can force every nomination into days of debate between every procedural vote in the Senate book  of which there will be many.         And legislation at least for now is still very much subject to the filibuster. On Thursday afternoon as one Republican after another went to the Senate floor to lament the end of one type of filibuster they voted against cutting off debate on the annual defense policy bill a measure that has passed with bipartisan support every year for decades.         Todays historic change to Senate rules escalates what is already a hyperpartisan atmosphere in Washington which is already preventing Congress from addressing our nations most significant challenges said former Senator Olympia Snowe a Republican and former Representative Dan Glickman a Democrat in a joint statement from the Bipartisan Policy Center.         Republican senators who were willing to team with Democrats on legislation like an immigration overhaul farm policy and a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act will probably think twice in the future.         Well have to see but I think it was certainly unfortunate said Senator Susan Collins a Maine Republican who has often worked with Democrats.         Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the Republican leader made clear that he hoped to exact the ultimate revenge taking back control of the Senate and using the new rules against the Democrats who made them. The solution to this problem is at the ballot box he said. We look forward to having a great election.         David Axelrod a former top adviser to Mr. Obama said retaliation by Republicans against the presidents broader agenda would end up hurting them more than Democrats. If their answer is Oh yeah we can make it even worse I think they do that at great risk Mr. Axelrod said. They have to make a decision about whether they want to be a shrinking shrieking blocking party or if they are going to be a national party.         From the moment Mr. Obama took office the president who proclaimed that there was no red America and blue America only the United States of America has strained to maintain some pretense of bipartisanship  through protracted and fruitless efforts to woo Republicans on his economic stimulus plan and health care law through dinner dates with some handpicked Republican friends through the nomination of Chuck Hagel a former Republican senator to lead the Defense Department.        
7,100000002564123,1,Article,News,U.S.,us,politics,"In Landmark Vote, Senate Limits Use of the Filibuster",JEREMY W. PETERS,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/us/politics/reid-sets-in-motion-steps-to-limit-use-of-filibuster.html,1,WASHINGTON  The Senate approved the most fundamental alteration of its rules in more than a generation on Thursday ending the minority partys ability to filibuster most presidential nominees in response to the partisan gridlock that has plagued Congress for much of the Obama administration.         Furious Republicans accused Democrats of a power grab warning them that they would deeply regret their action if they lost control of the Senate next year and the White House in years to come. Invoking the Founding Fathers and the meaning of the Constitution Republicans said Democrats were trampling the minority rights the framers intended to protect. But when the vote was called Senator Harry Reid the majority leader who was initially reluctant to force the issue prevailed 52 to 48.         Under the change the Senate will be able to cut off debate on executive and judicial branch nominees with a simple majority rather than rounding up a supermajority of 60 votes. The new precedent established by the Senate on Thursday does not apply to Supreme Court nominations or legislation itself.         It represented the culmination of years of frustration over what Democrats denounced as a Republican campaign to stall the machinery of Congress stymie President Obamas agenda and block his choices for cabinet posts and federal judgeships by insisting that virtually everything the Senate approves be done by a supermajority.         After repeatedly threatening to change the rules Mr. Reid decided to follow through when Republicans refused this week to back down from their effort to keep Mr. Obama from filling any of three vacancies on the most powerful appeals court in the country.         This was the final straw for some Democratic holdouts against limiting the filibuster providing Mr. Reid with the votes he needed to impose a new standard certain to reverberate through the Senate for years.         There has been unbelievable unprecedented obstruction Mr. Reid said as he set in motion the steps for the vote on Thursday. The Senate is a living thing and to survive it must change as it has over the history of this great country. To the average American adapting the rules to make the Senate work again is just common sense.         Republicans accused Democrats of irreparably damaging the character of an institution that in many ways still operates as it did in the 19th century and of disregarding the constitutional prerogative of the Senate as a body of advice and consent on presidential nominations.         You think this is in the best interest of the United States Senate and the American people? asked the Republican leader Senator Mitch McConnell sounding incredulous.         I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle youll regret this. And you may regret it a lot sooner than you think he added.         Mr. Obama applauded the Senates move. Todays pattern of obstruction it just isnt normal he told reporters at the White House. Its not what our founders envisioned. A deliberate and determined effort to obstruct everything no matter what the merits just to refight the results of an election is not normal and for the sake of future generations we cant let it become normal.         Only three Democrats voted against the measure.         The changes will apply to all 1183 executive branch nominations that require Senate confirmation  not just cabinet positions but hundreds of high- and midlevel federal agency jobs and government board seats.         This fight was a climax to the bitter debate between the parties over electoral mandates and the consequences of presidential elections. Republicans through their frequent use of the various roadblocks that congressional procedure affords them have routinely thwarted Democrats. Democrats in turn have accused Republicans of effectively trying to nullify the results of a presidential election they lost whether by trying to dismantle his health care law or keep Mr. Obama from filling his cabinet.

As the movement struggles to find pressure points in its quest for substantially higher wages for workers organizers said strikes were planned for the first time in cities like Charleston S.C.; Providence R.I.; and Pittsburgh.         The protests have expanded greatly since November 2012 when 200 fast-food workers engaged in a one-day strike at more than 20 restaurants in New York City the first such walkout in the history of the nations fast-food industry.         Theres been pretty huge growth in one year said Kendall Fells one of the movements main organizers. People understand that a one-day strike is not going to get them there. They understand that this needs to continue to grow.         The movement which includes the groups  The fast-food effort is backed by the Service Employees International Union and is also demanding that restaurants allow workers to unionize without the threat of retaliation.         Officials with the National Restaurant Association have said the one-day strikes are publicity stunts. They warn that increasing pay to $15 an hour when the federal minimum wage is $7.25 would cause restaurants to rely more on automation and hire fewer workers.         Industry officials say that only a small percentage of fast-food jobs pay the minimum wage and that those are largely entry-level jobs for workers under 25.         Backers of the movement for higher pay point to studies saying that the average age of fast-food workers is 29 and that more than one-fourth are parents raising children.         Simon Rojas who earns $8.07 an hour working at a McDonalds in South Central Los Angeles said he would join Thursdays one-day strike.         Its very difficult to live off $8.07 an hour said Mr. Rojas 23 noting that he is often assigned just 20 or 25 hours of work a week. I have to live with my parents. I would like to be able to afford a car and an apartment.         Mr. Rojas said he had studied for a pharmacy technicians certificate but he had been unable to save the $100 needed to apply for a license.         On Aug. 29 fast-food strikes took place in more than 50 cities. This weeks expanded protests will be joined by numerous community faith and student groups including USAction and United Students against Sweatshops.

But a well-timed new study suggests that a daily bout of exercise should erase or lessen many of the injurious effects even if you otherwise lounge all day on the couch and load up on pie. To undertake this valuable experiment which was  The scientists then asked their volunteers to impair their laudable health by doing a lot of sitting and gorging themselves.  Energy surplus is the technical name for those occasions when people consume more energy in the form of calories than they burn. If unchecked energy surplus contributes as we all know to a variety of poor health outcomes including insulin resistance — often the first step toward diabetes — and other metabolic problems.   Overeating and inactivity can each on its own produce an energy surplus. Together their ill effects are exacerbated often in a very short period of time. Earlier studies have found that even a few days of inactivity and overeating spark detrimental changes in previously healthy bodies.   Some of these experiments have also concluded that exercise blunts the ill effects of these behaviors in large part it has been assumed by reducing the energy surplus. It burns some of the excess calories. But a few scientists have suspected that exercise might do more; it might have physiological effects that extend beyond just incinerating surplus energy.  To test that possibility of course it would be necessary to maintain an energy surplus even with exercise. So that is what the University of Bath researchers decided to do.  Their method was simple. They randomly divided their volunteers into two groups one of which was assigned to run every day at a moderately intense pace on a treadmill for 45 minutes. The other group did not exercise.  Meanwhile the men in both groups were told to generally stop moving so much decreasing the number of steps that they took each day from more than 10000 on average to fewer than 4000 as gauged by pedometers. The exercising group’s treadmill workouts were not included in their step counts. Except when they were running they were as inactive as the other group. Both groups also were directed to start substantially overeating. The group that was not exercising increased their daily caloric intake by 50 percent compared with what it had been before while the exercising group consumed almost 75 percent more calories than previously with the additional 25 percent replacing the energy burned during training.  Over all the two groups’ net daily energy surplus was the same.  The experiment continued for seven days. Then both groups returned to the lab for additional testing including new insulin measurements and another biopsy of fat tissue.  The results were striking. After only a week the young men who had not exercised displayed a significant and unhealthy decline in their blood sugar control and equally worrying their biopsied fat cells seemed to have developed a malicious streak. Those cells examined using sophisticated genetic testing techniques were now overexpressing various genes that may contribute to unhealthy metabolic changes and underexpressing other genes potentially important for a well-functioning metabolism.  But the volunteers who had exercised once a day despite comparable energy surpluses were not similarly afflicted. Their blood sugar control remained robust and their fat cells exhibited far fewer of the potentially undesirable alterations in gene expression than among the sedentary men.  “Exercise seemed to completely cancel out many of the changes induced by overfeeding and reduced activity” said Dylan Thompson a professor of health sciences at the University of Bath and senior author of the study. And where it did not countermand the impacts he continued it “softened” them leaving the exercise group “better off than the nonexercise group” despite engaging in equivalently insalubrious behavior.  From a scientific standpoint this finding intimates that the metabolic effects of overeating and inactivity are multifaceted Dr. Thompson said with an energy surplus sparking genetic as well as other physiological changes. But just how exercise countermands those effects is impossible to say based on the new experiment he added. Differences in how each group’s metabolism utilized fats and carbohydrates could play a role he said as could the release of certain molecules from exercising muscles which only occurred among the men who ran.  Of more pressing interest though is the study’s practical message that “if you are facing a period of overconsumption and inactivity” — also known as the holidays — “a daily bout of exercise will prevent many of the negative changes at least in the short term” Dr. Thompson said. Of course his study involved young fit men and a relatively prolonged period of exercise. But the findings likely apply he said to other groups like older adults and women and perhaps to lesser amounts of training. That’s a possibility worth embracing as the pie servings accumulate.

Throughout the presentation she apparently posted disparaging comments on Twitter about her fellow attendees repeatedly using a common expletive.         Perhaps she hadnt realized that colleges keep track of their social media mentions.         It was incredibly unusual and foolish of her to do that  We would have wondered about the judgment of someone who spends their time on their mobile phone and makes such awful remarks Mr. Meiklejohn said.         As certain high school seniors work meticulously this month to finish their early applications to colleges some may not realize that comments they casually make online could negatively affect their prospects. In fact new  Of 381 college admissions officers who answered a Kaplan telephone questionnaire this year 31 percent said they had visited an applicants Facebook or other personal social media page to learn more about them  a five-percentage-point increase from last year. More crucially for those trying to get into college 30 percent of the admissions officers said they had discovered information online that had negatively affected an applicants prospects.         Students social media and digital footprint can sometimes play a role in the admissions process says Christine Brown the executive director of K-12 and college prep programs at Kaplan Test Prep. Its something that is becoming more ubiquitous and less looked down upon.         In the business realm employers now vet the online reputations of job candidates as a matter of course. Given the impulsiveness of typical teenagers however  not to mention the already fraught nature of college acceptances and rejections  the idea that admissions officers would covertly nose around the social media posts of prospective students seems more chilling.         There is some reason for concern. Ms. Brown says that most colleges dont have formal policies about admissions officers supplementing students files with their own online research. If colleges find seemingly troubling material online they may not necessarily notify the applicants involved.         To me its a huge problem said  These kinds of concerns prompted me last week to email 20 colleges and universities  small and large private and public East Coast and West Coast  to ask about their practices. Then I called admissions officials at 10 schools who agreed to interviews.         Each official told me that it was not routine practice at his or her institution for admissions officers to use Google searches on applicants or to peruse their social media posts. Most said their school received so many applications to review  with essays recommendations and often supplemental portfolios  that staff members wouldnt be able to do extra research online. A few also felt that online investigations might lead to unfair or inconsistent treatment.         As students use of social media is growing theres a whole variety of ways that college admissions officers can use it  Other admissions officials said they did not formally prohibit the practice. In fact they said admissions officers did look at online material about applicants on an ad hoc basis. Sometimes prospective students themselves ask an admissions office to look at blogs or videos they have posted; on other occasions an admissions official might look up an obscure award or event mentioned by an applicant for purposes of elucidation.         Last year we watched some animation videos and we followed media stories about an applicant who was involved in a political cause says Will Hummel an admissions officer at

But the time she hooked up with a guy at Brown University does come close. After his own orgasm that night she said he showed no interest in her satisfaction. The next time they got together it happened again. He “didn’t even care” said Ms. Gadinsky a health care case manager in New York City. “I don’t think he tried at all.” He fell asleep immediately leaving her staring at the ceiling. “I was really frustrated” she said. Like generations before them many young women like Ms. Gadinsky are finding that casual sex does not bring the physical pleasure that men more often experience. New research suggests why: Women are less likely to have orgasms during uncommitted sexual encounters than in serious relationships. At the same time researchers say that young women are becoming equal partners in the hookup culture often just as willing as young men to venture into sexual relationships without emotional ties. “The notion of sexual liberation where men and women both had equal access to casual sex assumed a comparable likelihood of that sex being pleasurable” said  Research involving 600 college students Similarly a  By contrast roughly three quarters of women in the survey said they had an orgasm the last time they had sex in a committed relationship. “We attribute that to practice with a partner which yields better success at orgasm and we also think the guys care more in a relationship” Dr. England said. Indeed young men surveyed in Dr. England’s study often admitted that they are less focused on sexually pleasing a woman they are seeing casually than one they are dating. Duvan Giraldo 26 a software technician in Elmhurst Queens said that satisfying a partner “is always my mission” but added “I’m not going to try as hard as when I’m with someone I really care about.” And with women he’s just met he said it can be awkward to talk about specific needs in the bedroom. “You’re practically just strangers at that point” he said. The lack of guidance is common Dr. England said. “Women are not feeling very free in these casual contexts to say what they want and need” she said. Part of the problem she added is that women still may be stigmatized for having casual sex. Dr. Garcia said “We’ve been sold this bill of goods that we’re in an era where people can be sexually free and participate equally in the hookup culture. The fact is that not everyone’s having a good time.” What women need to achieve orgasm can be very different from what they find in casual sex. Roughly one-quarter of women reliably experience orgasm through intercourse alone according to a review of 32 studies conducted by  Vanessa Martini 23 from Marin County Calif. learned early on that most men she slept with casually would not intuit her needs. “I haven’t hooked up with anybody who was so cavalier as to just like not even care” she said. “But I think most of them were somewhat baffled that it would require more than just them thrusting.” Ms. Martini said she was never taught how to have good sex let alone how to ask for what she needs. The education she received in school was aimed at stopping teenagers from having sex at all; there wasn’t much discussion of arousal. Ms. Martini said most cultural representations of sex left out the messy details. “The way we view sex in porn and in movies and in books people aren’t talking to each other like ‘Oh my foot’s falling asleep we need to move’” she said. Communicating about those particulars is especially tricky in hookups. When one awkward exchange or misread text message could end the arrangement altogether there’s a certain amount of pressure to tread softly Ms. Martini said. “You have to balance a lot of things in your brain like what’s more important to me — just getting off or do I actually want to have a connection with this person?” Debra Herbenick Some women confronted with these roadblocks are redefining casual sex and the physical pleasure that they expect from it. Sex without strings has carnal and emotional benefits that don’t depend on reaching orgasm they say. “Something we don’t talk about is why having an orgasm is the main goal or the only goal” of sex Dr. Herbenick said. “Who are we to say women should be having orgasms?” Casey Romaine a 22-year-old Bard College graduate living in Nashville Tenn. said that more than sex hookups are often much more about two people giving each other the sense of intimacy however brief they need to get through the week. “It’s just sort of like having the experience and having somebody that you can call or you can like whose house you can spend the night in if you don’t feel like you want to be going home alone” she said. “I think a lot of the time it almost is weirdly irrelevant whether or not the sex is actually good.” For Kim Huynh a 29-year-old filmmaker in San Francisco sacrificing a reliable orgasm for sex without the burden of commitment was a conscious decision. After a couple of relationships in college Ms. Huynh spent about five years without a serious boyfriend and many on-again off-again flings. “As far as my ability to climax consistently that’s something I was able to have in my monogamous relationships that I never had” in less committed circumstances she said. Yet mediocre sex was a small price to pay “for the freedom to be able to enjoy it all.” The physical aspect of a tryst with a relative stranger was gratifying she said even if her chances of reaching orgasm were limited. When her partner’s performance was lackluster she still took pride in her own sexual prowess. “To sort of know yourself to be sort of skilled in a way or to be able to see someone else’s pleasure that was your own doing I think there’s definitely something very empowering about that” she said.

On the day of  More and more longtime residents are being forced out as landlords and speculators race to capitalize on the money stream.         Mary Elizabeth Phillips a retired accountant is fighting eviction from the rent-controlled apartment where she has lived for almost half a century. If her new landlords have their way she will have to move in April shortly after her 98th birthday because they want to sell the units.         Her neighborhood has given way around her. The car dealership across the street is now a luxury apartment complex complete with rooftop herb garden a butterfly habitat and a Whole Foods.         I can understand it from an investment standpoint she said of her landlords actions. But I dont think Id ever be that coldblooded about this.         While the technology boom has bred hostility it has also brought San Francisco undeniable benefits. Mayor Edwin M. Lee credits the technology sector with helping to pull the city out of the recession creating jobs and nourishing a thriving economy that is the envy of cash-starved cities across the country.         The industry is not so much taking over but complementing the job creation we want in the city Mr. Lee said while giving a tour of middle Market Street to show off its renaissance from a seedy skid row to a tech district where Twitter Square and other companies have made their home.         Yet city officials must grapple with the arithmetic of squeezing more people into the limited space afforded by San Franciscos 49 square miles. And it is the housing shortage that underlies much of the sniping about tech workers.         San Francisco has the least affordable housing in the nation with just 14 percent of homes accessible to middle-class buyers said Jed Kolko chief economist at the real estate website  Affordable housing projects are constructed and the money set aside for that purpose is used but the demand is just far greater than what can be supplied said Fred Brousseau of the city budget and legislative analysts office. Evictions under a provision of state law that allows landlords to evict rent-controlled tenants if they convert a building for sale have more than tripled in the past three years just as they did during the first tech boom.         To Yelly Brandon a 36-year-old hairstylist and her boyfriend Anthony Rocco an archivist the obstacles to finding housing became clear when they spent two months searching for an apartment. At open houses they said they were competing with young tech workers who offered more than the asking price and cash up front.         People were just throwing money in the air Ms. Brandon said.         The influx of wealth is in turn changing the tenor of neighborhoods.  Nowhere are the changes starker than in the  Evan Williams of Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook have bought homes near there.

The first is that the boys DNA matches that of Western Europeans showing that during the last Ice Age people from Europe had reached farther east across Eurasia than previously supposed. Though none of the Malta boys skin or hair survives his genes suggest he would have had brown hair brown eyes and freckled skin.         The second surprise is that his DNA also matches a large proportion  about 25 percent  of the DNA of living Native Americans. The first people to arrive in the Americas have long been assumed to have descended from Siberian populations related to East Asians. It now seems that they may be a mixture between the Western Europeans who had reached Siberia and an East Asian population.         The Malta boy was 3 to 4 years old and was buried under a stone slab wearing an ivory diadem a bead necklace and a bird-shaped pendant. Elsewhere at the same site about 30 Venus figurines were found of the kind produced by the Upper Paleolithic cultures of Europe. The remains were excavated by Russian archaeologists over a 20-year period ending in 1958 and stored in museums in St. Petersburg.         There they lay for some 50 years until they were examined by a team led by  But the first results were disappointing. The boys mitochondrial DNA belonged to the lineage known as U which is commonly found among the modern humans who first entered Europe about 44000 years ago. The lineages found among Native Americans are those designated A B C D and X so the U lineage pointed to contamination of the bone by the archaeologists or museum curators who had handled it a common problem with ancient DNA projects. The study was put on low speed for about a year because I thought it was all contamination Dr. Willerslev said.         His team proceeded anyway to analyze the nuclear genome which contains the major part of human inheritance. They were amazed when the nuclear genome also turned out to have partly European ancestry. Examining the genome from a second Siberian grave site that of an adult who died 17000 years ago they found the same markers of European origin. Together the two genomes indicate that descendants of the modern humans who entered Europe had spread much farther east across Eurasia than had previously been assumed and occupied Siberia during an extremely cold period starting 20000 years ago that is known as the Last Glacial Maximum.         The other surprise from the Malta boys genome was that it matched to both Europeans and Native Americans but not to East Asians. Dr. Willerslevs interpretation was that the ancestors of Native Americans had already separated from the East Asian population when they interbred with the people of the Malta culture and that this admixed population then crossed over the Beringian land bridge that then lay between Siberia and Alaska to become a founding population of Native Americans.         We estimate that 14 to 38 percent of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population he and colleagues wrote in an article published Wednesday in the journal  A European contribution to Native American ancestry could explain two longstanding puzzles about the peoples origins. One is that many ancient Native American skulls including that of the well-known Kennewick man look very different from those of the present day population. Another is that one of the five mitochondrial DNA lineages found in Native Americans the lineage known as X also occurs in Europeans. One explanation is that Europeans managed to cross the Atlantic in small boats some 20000 years ago and joined the Native Americans from Siberia.         Dr. Willerslev thinks it more likely that European bearers of the X lineage had migrated across Siberia with the ancestors of the Malta culture and joined them in their trek across the Beringian land bridge.

Today their blended family is a sprawling sometimes uneasy ensemble of two sharp-eyed sons from her two previous husbands a daughter and son from his second marriage ex-spouses of varying degrees of involvement the partners of ex-spouses the bemused in-laws and a kitten named Agnes that likes to sleep on computer keyboards.         If the Burnses seem atypical as an American nuclear family how about the Schulte-Waysers a merry band of two married dads six kids and two dogs? Or the Indrakrishnans a successful immigrant couple in Atlanta whose teenage daughter divides her time between prosaic homework and the precision footwork of ancient Hindu dance; the Glusacs of Los Angeles with their two nearly grown children and their litany of middle-class challenges that seem like minor sagas; Ana Perez and Julian Hill of Harlem unmarried and just getting by but with Warren Buffett-size dreams for their three young children; and the alarming number of families with incarcerated parents a sorry byproduct of Americas status as the  The typical American family if it ever lived anywhere but on  Researchers who study the structure and evolution of the American family express unsullied astonishment at how rapidly the family has changed in recent years the transformations often exceeding or capsizing those same experts predictions of just a few journal articles ago.         This churning this turnover in our intimate partnerships is creating complex families on a scale weve not seen before said  Yet for all the restless shape-shifting of the American family researchers who comb through census survey and historical data and conduct field studies of ordinary home life have identified a number of key emerging themes.         Families they say are becoming more socially egalitarian over all even as economic disparities widen. Families are more ethnically racially religiously and stylistically diverse than half a generation ago  than even half a year ago.         In increasing numbers blacks marry whites atheists marry Baptists men marry men and women women Democrats marry Republicans and start talk shows. Good friends join forces as part of the voluntary kin movement sharing medical directives wills even adopting one another legally.         Single people live alone and proudly consider themselves families of one  more generous and civic-minded than so-called greedy marrieds.         There are really good studies showing that single people are more likely than married couples to be in touch with friends neighbors siblings and parents said  But that doesnt mean theyll be single forever. There are not just more types of families and living arrangements than there used to be said  At the same time the old-fashioned family plan of stably married parents residing with their children remains a source of considerable power in America  but one that is increasingly seen as out of reach to all but the educated elite.         Were seeing a class divide not only between the haves and the have-nots but between the I dos and the I do nots Dr. Coontz said. Those who are enjoying the perks of a good marriage wouldnt stand for any other kind she said while those who would benefit most from marital stability are the ones least likely to have the resources to sustain it.         Yet across the divide runs a white picket fence our unshakable star-spangled belief in the value of marriage and family. We marry divorce and remarry at rates not seen anywhere else in the developed world. We lavish  Were sappy family romantics. When an informal sample of 52 Americans of different ages professions and hometowns were asked the first thought that came to mind on hearing the word family the answers varied hardly at all. Love! Kids! Mom! Dinner!         Its the backbone of how we live said David Anderson 52 an insurance claims adjuster from Chicago. It means everything said Linda McAdam 28 who is in human resources on Long Island.         Yes everything and sometimes too many things. Its almost like a weight said Rob Fee 26 a financial analyst in San Francisco a heavy weight. Or as the comedian George Burns said Happiness is having a large loving caring close-knit family in another city.         In charting the differences between todays families and those of the past demographers start with the kids  or rather the lack of them.         The nations birthrate today is  One big reason is the soaring cost of ushering offspring to functional independence. According to the Department of Agriculture the average middle-class couple will spend  As steep as the fertility decline has been the marriage rate has fallen more sharply particularly among young women who do most of the nations childbearing. As a result 41 percent of babies are now born out of wedlock a fourfold increase since 1970.         The trend is not demographically uniform instead tracking the nations widening gap in income and opportunity. Among women with a bachelors degrees or higher 90 percent adhere to the old playground song and put marriage before a baby carriage. For everybody else maternity is often decoupled from matrimony: 40 percent of women with some college but no degree and 57 percent of women with high school diplomas or less are unmarried when they give birth to their first child.         More than one-quarter of these unwed mothers are living with a partner who may or may not be their childs biological father. The rise of the cohabiting couple is another striking feature of the evolving American family: From 1996 to 2012 the number jumped almost 170 percent to 7.8 million from 2.9 million.         Nor are unmarried mothers typically in their teens; contrary to all the talk of an epidemic of teenage motherhood the birthrate among adolescent girls has dropped by nearly half since 1991 and last year hit an all-time low a public health triumph that experts attribute to better sex education and birth-control methods. Most unmarried mothers today demographers say are in their 20s and early 30s.         Also dÃ©modÃ© is the old debate over whether mothers of dependent children should work outside the home. The facts have voted the issue is settled and Paycheck Mommy is now a central organizing principle of the modern American family.         The share of mothers employed full or part time has quadrupled since the 1950s and today accounts for nearly three-quarters of women with children at home. The number of women who are their families sole or primary breadwinner also has soared to 40 percent today from 11 percent in 1960.         Yes I wear the pants in the family said Ana Perez 35 a mother of three and a vice president at a financial services company in New York who was indeed wearing pants. I can say it brings me joy to know I can take care of my family.         Cultural attitudes are adapting accordingly. Sixty-two percent of the public and 72 percent of adults under 30  Mothers are bringing home more of the bacon and of the mortarboards too. While most couples are an even match scholastically 28 percent of married women are better educated than their mates; that is true of just 19 percent of married men. Forty years ago the asymmetry went the other way.         Some experts argue that the growing legion of mothers with advanced degrees has helped sharpen the already brutal competition for admission to the nations elite universities which stress the importance of extracurricular activities. Nothing predicts the breadth and busyness of a childs after-school schedule better it turns out than the mothers level of education.         One change that caught many family researchers by surprise was the recent dip in the divorce rate. After many decades of upward march followed by a long stubborn stay at the familiar 50 percent mark that made every nuptial feel like a coin flip the rate began falling in 1996 and is now just above 40 percent for first-time marriages.         The decline has been even more striking among middle- and upper-middle-income couples with college degrees. For them fewer than one in three marriages is expected to end in divorce a degree of stability that allows elite couples to merge their resources with confidence maximally invest in their children and otherwise widen the gap between themselves and the struggling masses.         There are exceptions of course. Among baby boomers the rate of marriage failure has surged 50 percent in the past 20 years  perhaps out of an irritable nostalgia researchers said for the days of free love better love anything but this love. Nor do divorce rates appear to have fallen among those who take the old Samuel Johnson quip as a prescription allowing hope to triumph over experience and marrying again and again.         For both Mike and Kristi Burns now in their 40s the first marriage came young and left early and the second stuck around for more than a dozen years.         Kristi was 19 living in South Carolina and her Marine boyfriend was about to be shipped to Japan. I wasnt attached to him really she said but for some reason I felt this might be my only chance at marriage.         In Japan Kristi gave birth to her son Brandon realized she was lonely and miserable and left the marriage seven weeks after their first anniversary. Back in the States Kristi studied to be a travel agent moved to Michigan and married her second husband at age 23.         He was an electrician. He adopted Brandon and the couple had a son Griffin. The marriage lasted 13 years.         We were really great friends but we werent a great husband and wife Kristi said. Our parenting styles were too different.         Besides she went on he didnt verbalize a lot but he was mad a lot and I was tired of walking around on eggshells.         After the divorce friends persuaded her to try the online dating service  Kristi was one of the first people to ping me said Mike Burns an engineer for an e-commerce company. This was at 3 in the morning.         They started chatting. Mike told Kristi how hed married his first wife while he was still in college  definitely too young he said  and divorced her two years later. He met his second wife through mutual friends they had a big church wedding started a software publishing company together sold it and had two children Brianna and Alec.         When the marriage started going downhill Mike ignored signs of trouble like the comments from neighbors who noticed his wife was never around on weekends.         I was delusional I was depressed he said. I still had the attitude that divorce wasnt something you did.         After 15 years of marriage his wife did it for him and kicked him out of the house. His divorce papers hadnt yet been finalized he told Kristi that first chat night. Ill help you get through it she replied.         Mike and Kristi admit their own three-year-old marriage isnt perfect. The kids are still adjusting to one another. Sometimes Kristi a homemaker feels jealous of how much attention her husband showers on his daughter Brianna 13. Sometimes Mike retreats into his computer. Yet they are determined to stay together.         I know everyone thinks this marriage is a joke and people expect it to fail said Kristi . But that just makes me work harder at it.         Id say our chances of success are better than average her husband added.         In America family is at once about home and the next great frontier.         LOS ANGELES  The Schulte-Wayser family is like the Jetsons: a blend of midcentury traditional and postmodern cool.         One parent is the breadwinner a corporate lawyer who is Type A when it comes to schoolwork bedtime and the importance of rules. The other parent is the self-described baby whisperer staying home to care for the couples two daughters and four sons who dash through their days as if wearing jetpacks.         Both parents know when rules and roles are made for subverting. We are each of us very maternal in our own way said Joshua Wayser 50 the lawyer. I take my girls shopping and Im in charge of beauty and hair care. Mr. Wayser glanced at Richard Schulte 61 his homemaker-artist husband who was sitting nearby.         Of course Mr. Wayser added dryly he doesnt think I do a good job.         Mr. Wayser Mr. Schulte and their six adopted children are part of one of the more emphatic reinventions of the standard family flow chart. A growing number of gay men and lesbians are pursuing parenthood any way they can: adoption surrogacy donor sperm.         Theres a gayby boom thats for sure Mr. Wayser said. So many of our friends are having kids.         Some critics have expressed concern that the children of gay parents may suffer from social stigma and the lack of conventional adult role models or that same-sex couples are not suited to the monotonous rigors of family life. Earlier studies often invoked in the culture wars over same-sex marriage suggested that children who lived with gay parents were prone to lower grades conduct disorders and a heightened risk of drug and alcohol problems.         But new research suggests that such fears are misplaced. Through a preliminary analysis of census data and other sources  Once these factors are taken into account said Dr. Rosenfeld author of  And two-father couples in defiance of stereotype turn out to be exemplars of domesticity. In her long-term studies of unconventional families  Over 14 years she said I was shocked to find that none of the male couples with children had broken up not one. Dr. Stacey author of  Theres no maybe about the gayby boom. According to the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles the number of  Driving the rise in same-sex parenthood is the resonant success of the marriage equality movement which has led to the  Some crave the fetters of DNA and here women have an advantage. Many of the children of lesbian couples are the biological offspring of one of the women and a semen donor  who may be anonymous a friend the brother of the nongestating woman or  The Schulte-Wayser family started out unhyphenated as the Waysers. The two men had broken up; Mr. Wayser was living alone in Los Angeles his law career was in flux and he was tired of obsessing about work. I thought Ive got to do something elseÂ  he said. I had to come out to myself as a father.         His mother was thrilled and she offered to pay the costs for a surrogate mother to carry a baby conceived with his sperm. Mr. Wayser said no.         I wanted the clarity of having someone who didnt share my genetics who was completely different from me he said.         He met with an adoption lawyer in March 2000 and by June he had a newborn daughter Julie. Several months later Mr. Schulte called to chat heard Julie in the background and stopped by to meet her.         The baby reminded him of Don King the boxing promoter. It was love at first sight Mr. Schulte said and Mr. Wayser acknowledged I used Julie as bait.         His old boyfriend took it. We were a couple again Mr. Schulte said. Or rather he amended we were a family. He and Mr. Wayser later married in Malibu.         From 2002 to 2009 four brothers and a sister followed  Derek A J Isaac (all from one mother) Shayna and Joey. Thats my line in the sand Mr. Wayser said. Weve run out of room.         Yet he believes its easier to manage a large family than a small one. They entertain each other. They organize themselves he said. We send the kids out. We say Go ride your bike go out and play. We want them to have a very traditional childhood in a nontraditional setting.         He admits to being a worrier. Some of the children have learning disabilities and require extensive tutoring and he doesnt know what risks the birth mothers might have taken during pregnancy.         But he resents people who note the color of his childrens skin as well as his obvious financial resources and cluck about how noble he is and how lucky the children are.         No Im the one whos lucky here he said. Im not trying to save the world.         Ana Perez 35 who moved to New York from the Dominican Republic at age 5 has an open smile a firm handshake and a vivid scrappy manner just this side of a fireplug. But as she recalled the night she threw the father of her two older children out of her Harlem apartment her voice cracked into a dozen pieces and her eyes blurred with tears.         She might have accepted his infidelities if hed kept them discreet cheap and away from the neighborhood. I had this mentality that men will be men. she said.         But when he began lavishly dating the younger sister of a friend of hers Ms. Perez confronted him in a fury.         I said Youve been spending money on this person when you have children who need diapers and milk?Â  she said. The last straw was we had this huge fight in the kitchen and I pulled a knife on him. For a second I saw my children without a mother  because I would be in jail.         Their relationship ended that night a decade ago she said and I never looked back.         He still visits with George 16 and Bryana 10 as a friend figure Ms. Perez said but he has no say in their upbringing.         For the past six years Ms. Perez has lived with Julian Hill 39 the father of her third child Bubba 4. Mr. Hill is tall and African-American his head shaved his cream-colored suit impeccably paired with a blue-checked bankers shirt and yellow tie. He is devoted to all three children and involved in their everyday lives.         I come home every night he said. They might be asleep when I get home but Im here every night. Im always pushing them hard to do their very best maybe sometimes a little too hard.         Until this fall Ms. Perez worked for a financial services firm and she has been the familys primary earner. Mr. Hill equally ambitious has worked as a notary public mortgage closer and occasional stock investor. He and Ms. Perez recently started a small notary-mortgage business.         I think like Warren Buffett Mr. Hill said. My plan is to be a billionaire but if I fall short and end up a millionaire that would be fine.         Yet he admits that for now even that downsized goal remains elusive. If youre talking about income he said were lower lower middle class.         If youre talking about their relationship status he and Ms. Perez have been engaged for more than a year and they plan to go more than another year before getting married.         Of the many changes to the design packaging and content of family life over the past generation researchers cite two as especially significant.         One is the sharp increase in out-of-wedlock births among all but the most highly educated women. The second is the repositioning of marriage from cornerstone to capstone from a foundational act of early adulthood to a crowning event of later adulthood  an event that follows such previous achievements as finishing college starting a career and owning furniture not made from fruit crates.         The two trends are interrelated researchers say but for reasons that are often misunderstood. Unmarried parents are not necessarily the careless and shortsighted hedonists of stereotype. Instead a growing number of Americans are simply intimidated by the whole idea of marriage: It has assumed ever greater cultural status becoming the mark of established winners rather than of modestly optimistic beginners (while weddings have become extravagant pageants where doves and butterflies are released but still nobody gets the bridesmaid dresses right).         Childbearing on the other hand happens naturally and offers what marriage all too often does not: lifelong bonds of love.         For many cohabiting couples theres a high bar for marriage high expectations of where they should be at economically or emotionally and if they dont meet that bar theyll put off getting married said  But if theyre reasonably pleased with the relationship and happen to find themselves pregnant she continued they may realize theyre not in a great place financially to become parents but theyre still happy to have the child. They find a sense of purpose and fulfillment in parenthood even when the rest of life is withholding the goods.          In the middle class the divorce rate has gone down and family life is in many ways simpler than it used to be she said in an interview. Theres far more complexity and churning of households among the poor a turnover of partnerships lots of half-siblings.         Yet Dr. Edin also punctures the myth of the low-income father as a deadbeat who deposits his sperm and runs. Instead the young men in her study were eager to establish their paternity.         Theyre showing up at the hospital and signing birth certificates in droves she said. Theyre doing all this voluntarily even though they know that by having their name on the certificate theyll be liable for child support and could go to jail if they dont pay.         The fathers also proved to be more involved in their childrens lives than previously believed. Even five years in about two-thirds of fathers are seeing their kids at least monthly and just under half are seeing their kids several times a week Dr. Edin said.         Most of Ms. Perezs previous co-workers were younger than she was and came from middle-class backgrounds and she acknowledges that their timing of life events has its benefits.         You go to college you build your finances you marry you build more finances then you have children she said. If you wait longer you have the foundation youre more educated and you have the confidence in yourself that youre able to survive.         Then again she laughed in Spanish culture we do everything early.         She is convinced that having her first child at 19 was the right thing to do. Without that incentive I would have had such a different life she said. I would have been much less productive. I would have spent all my time just hanging out.         But between the spur of her familys needs and a work ethic she describes as awesome Ms. Perez rose to a vice presidency at her previous company and I didnt even graduate high school she said.         Nevertheless she frets incessantly about the future. Shed like to go back to school and set something aside for her childrens college educations; she wont buy cereal thats not on sale; and the last thing she wants to spend money on right now is a wedding.         Im O.K. just going to City Hall she said.         Mr. Hill wont hear of it. I cant do that I cant just go downtown he said. I want to do something big a wedding with friends and family standing together.         So hell wait until hes saved enough to pay for the wedding of his dreams when he can celebrate the family he loves and know it has arrived.         ATLANTA  When people first meet Dr. Indran Indrakrishnan a gastroenterologist with a busy private practice near Atlanta they take note of his unusual name his crisply lilting accent his tan complexion and wavy black hair and they ask So doctor where are you from?         See if you can guess Dr. Indrakrishnan replies cheerfully. India? No. Pakistan? No. Iran Egypt Turkey Afghanistan? Negatives all around.         At that point theyre stumped and they move on to South America he said and when I finally tell them I was born in Sri Lanka they look more confused than ever. Sri Lanka? Where is that?Â          Such casual geographic illiteracy may soon give way under the sheer force of numbers. Dr. Indrakrishnan is part of a new tide of immigration that has been sweeping America upending old voting blocs reconfiguring neighborhoods diversifying local restaurant options and casting a fresh perspective on the meaning of traditional family values.         Though much of the immigration debate has focused on Latinos the fastest-growing immigrant groups  The 1950s stereotype of the ideal American family of Dick Jane and Wonder Bread homogeneity arose at a time when the immigration rate was near historic lows. Today the best place to find a traditional G-rated American family may be in an immigrant community. Asian-American families in particular are exceptionally stable.  Many of the new Asian immigrants come from solidly middle-class backgrounds and many though by no means all do as well or better after moving to the United States. Fifty-one percent hold college degrees compared with 31 percent of all adults. According to recent studies Asian-Americans have the highest average household income of any racial group roughly $68000 a year compared with $55000 for whites and $34000 for African-Americans.         At the front edge of the Asian-American boom are immigrants from South Asia including India Pakistan and Sri Lanka.         Dr. Indrakrishnan 53 who also teaches at the Emory University School of Medicine is something of a celebrity among South Asian immigrants  the sociable civic-minded and highly successful professional everyone wants to schmooze with at the local Hindu temple each week.         Sometimes I have to go to temple during off hours he said or Ill get caught up chatting there the entire day.         He lives with his wife Gayathri 49 a tax accountant and their daughter Harini a high school senior in a gated enclave on the banks of a glistening artificial lake not far from the former residence of the football quarterback Michael Vick. The house feels like a castle only bigger  15000 square feet of vaulted chandeliered ceilings an enormous alabaster fireplace matching ornate staircases that curve together like an upside-down heart and an elevator if youre too tired for the stairs.         Personal statements can be found throughout: in one corner an elegant bronze sculpture of the Hindu deity  Dance keeps me connected to my culture she said. Ive got the best of both worlds.         Her parents grew up in the same part of Sri Lanka and had friends a  He flew to Toronto for a rendezvous. If it wasnt exactly love at first sight she said the chemistry was there. The couple spent a year exchanging phone calls and letters and were married in 1991.         We had whats called a semi-arranged marriage Dr. Indrakrishnan said. Its quite common back in India and Sri Lanka. Families are involved but they dont push; we had to like each other and get along.         After they married and settled in the United States Ms. Indrakrishnan traded microbiology for an M.B.A. and a numbers-crunching career. She and her husband became American citizens a decade ago.         I love living here! he said. It is truly the land of opportunities. Yet he said he would not have wanted to marry an American woman and when asked the first word that came to mind on hearing the word family he said Gayathri my wife.         The Census Bureau does not track the frequency of arranged marriages but researchers believe the numbers are rising. Among other signs they said is the growing number of immigrant matchmaking websites like  And though many Americans may bridle at the idea studies suggest there is little downside to letting the family do your advance work. Kathryn Klement a doctoral candidate in psychology at Northern Illinois University surveyed 329 married Indian women 176 of them in arranged marriages and said I didnt find any significant differences between the two groups in marital happiness feelings of intimacy trust and commitment sexual satisfaction and the ease with which the women could express their desires.         Indran and Gayathri Indrakrishnan independently identified the same key to long-lasting marital harmony. Its tolerance she said. Many of Dr. Indrakrishnans American patients are not very tolerant of their spouses he said. They want the chemistry to be perfect and if it isnt pfft they split up.         Tolerance extends to their parenting style. Their expectations for Harini are quite high but they care less whether she aces every class than that she is always trying always seeking to improve.         If there is homework due or a test the next day and shes goofing off and not listening to me yes Ill be upset her mother said. Harini it seems has absorbed the parental credo. When she sensed that Facebook was interfering with her schoolwork she deactivated her account.         Also poised for deactivation is a certain clichÃ© symbolized by fangs and stripes.         It is no secret that many Asian-American students excel academically; their average SAT scores for example are the  One theory to gain traction lately is that Asian-American parents are harsh taskmasters who virtually chain their children to their desks and pianos a view reinforced by Amy Chua in her best-selling book  But a long-term study of 300 Chinese-American families suggests that view is nothing but a stereotype. The researchers led by  Supportive parenting always yields the best outcome academically and socio-emotionally too she added. These kids outperform the kids of tiger parents by quite a lot.         She and her colleagues proposed other factors that might help explain the good report cards: family pride; cultural traditions that extol education like  They gave up everything for their kids as Dr. Kim characterized this attitude so Id better not blow it. And when they succeed they bring honor to ancestors descendants the entire high-fiving clan.         LOS ANGELES  Jan Glusac 51 is blond and heigh-ho friendly a first-grade teacher with a first-rate tolerance for contradictory ideas. A few years ago she and her family participated in a landmark study by researchers from the University of California Los Angeles  a close anthropological look at the daily lives of 32 typical middle-class American families.         Does she feel that her family is in fact typical?         I do and I dont Ms. Glusac says.         She wears a long white skirt black blouse jeans jacket and a silver necklace and is sitting on a plump aubergine couch in a comfortable recently renovated postwar bungalow in Westchester a solidly middle-class neighborhood not far from the Los Angeles airport.         On the typical side of the ledger: The average middle-class family has two children and seated next to Ms. Glusac are her two children Katie and Chris.         Katie 17 is a high school senior a star of her cross-country and soccer teams an intern at a local veterinary clinic and these days a captive player in that all-American combat sport called applying to college. Chris 21 is a Santa Monica College engineering student who still lives at home but plans to transfer next year to the University of California Santa Barbara.         We may soon be empty nesters Ms. Glusac says. Thats one phase of life were not ready for.         But at least theyll still have Ollie she says  the best dog ever! Katie chimes in  and dogs it so happens are the most popular pet in America  Around 6 p.m. Srdan Glusac 50 arrives home from his job as an avionics engineer at Federal Express. Mr. Glusac who goes by the nickname Serg (pronounced surge) was born in Sarajevo Bosnia but grew up in Montreal. He looks like the original from which Chris was cloned: the same mild face the same fine sandy hair.         Mr. Glusac generally gets home an hour or two after his wife a scheduling disparity common among two-career households: American men spend 35 to 55 minutes  Less typical is Mr. Glusacs Bosnian mother Ilinka Volk who lives nearby and has long acted as the fantasy super-grandma obviating the need for day care chauffeuring the kids to soccer games and serving up Old World comfort food like stuffed cabbage goulash and a revelatory Bosnian custard called snow clouds.         Jan Glusac points out that her family is better off than most with a household income nearly four times the  And now were a four-car family Chris says sheepishly. That sounds pretty bad doesnt it? The average number of cars per American family is 2.28.         The family has had its share of frame shifts and body blows. Ms. Glusac was treated for  That made me start crying Ms. Glusac says. I knew exactly what he meant.         As a ninth grader Katie was arrested after shoplifting more than $100 worth of clothing from a department store. Her parents were devastated. She was grounded for the summer and had to perform community service help pay her legal fees by handing over most of the money shed saved since elementary school and endure the humiliation of hearing her mother tell other parents that if they didnt want their children associating with Katie shed understand.         That was the hardest part the strain on my relationship with my parents Katie says. But what came out of it was a stronger relationship than before  and lucky for her no permanent record.         In the U.C.L.A. study a team of researchers associated with the  As recounted in the books  The researchers also particularized the centrality of the kitchen where the largest and most visible clocks are displayed and where the greatest number of calendars school memos and to-do lists are posted.         Yet the lure of a festively pushpinned corkboard has its limits. The researchers determined that even when all of the family members were at home and awake together they were in the same room only 14 percent of the time.         The researchers have since done comparative studies of families in Italy Sweden Samoa and the Peruvian Amazon and have concluded that American families are outliers in their fixation on childrens needs and childrens success.         In other societies school-aged children are expected to be vigilant and see what needs to be done around the house and they routinely do chores without being asked said  Instead given todays single-digit admission rates at the nations elite universities middle-class American parents want their children to focus almost exclusively on homework and extracurricular activities. In a study of the after-school life of students in the Philadelphia area  At one suburban school she said I went through the schedules of 100 fourth graders and couldnt find a single child who did not have any organized activities. The researchers also determined that the time children spent in such activities rose in tandem with the mothers education: 4 hours 54 minutes per week for the children of mothers with some college 5 hours 37 minutes for the offspring of college graduates and 6 hours 33 minutes for the children of mothers with graduate degrees.         I remember feeling like that was all I ever did  I was always in the car driving someone someplace Jan Glusac says of her familys two-car days. I dont think I could keep that schedule up at this point in my life she adds. Nowadays the kids largely take care of themselves Ms. Glusac says and theyre either out of the house or working in their rooms. We love being together as a family she says even if that means little more than sharing the same roof.         The American family began life in the raggedness of the Colonial era as a kind of organizational Swiss Army knife  many institutions in one convenient package.         The home was a place of business of relentless industry where there was always more flax to spin and tallow to drip; all able-bodied family members from toddlerhood onward were expected to work for the family economy. (In fact the word family comes from the Latin for servant.)         The home was a delivery ward schoolroom hospital and funeral parlor. And in an age before centralized government or even a reliable town sheriff the home served as the primary locus of social control. Everyone had to reside in the all-encompassing embrace of a bustling household and adults who tried to live alone particularly single men were viewed with suspicion advised to marry find room and board with a decent family or get out of town.         As recently as the 1950s according to  Yet as a young nation of wide horizons and Powerball opportunities America also encouraged a degree of footlooseness a scorn for the settled and a yen for the new. That novelty-seeking spirit applied as much to conjugal matters as economic ones and the divorce rate rose steadily along with the number of stars on the flag. By the turn of the 20th century the United States had the highest divorce rate in the Western world a title it retains to this day.         Its the great American paradox. We value marriage as the center of civilized society Dr. Cherlin said. At the same time we value our liberty the pursuit of personal happiness and the right to leave a bad marriage behind.         Other factors helped give the American family its distinctive cast. As the population shifted westward and the distances between dwellings opened Americans grew accustomed to a degree of privacy and personal space that few other earthlings could share.         The passion for privacy accelerated as the Industrial Revolution pulled productive activity out of the house and into the factory leaving the home as a private sanctum for the family. Americans went wild for the privatized family and family-themed activities: the family vacation kiddie birthday parties decorating the Christmas tree and the ultimate American family holiday Thanksgiving signed into law by the man who saved the Union Abraham Lincoln.         And over the river and through the woods notwithstanding that family mostly meant nuclear with ties to older or second-order relatives increasingly frayed.         Industrialization and the entry of women into the work force changed the nature of marriage as well from the pragmatic merging of skill sets that prevailed in the agricultural era to a relationship of choice based on friendship personal compatibility and love.         Marriage as an institution lost much of its power over our lives but marriage as a relationship became more powerful than ever said the social historian  The trend has only intensified with time. The less we need marriage she said the more we expect from it.         One variant of the modern American family  sadly characteristic if often ignored  is the family struggling with the impact of an incarcerated parent. Largely as a result of harsh drug laws and mandatory m

The living told stories of the dead or dying  the people swept away in a torrent of seawater the corpses strewn among the wreckage. Photos from the hard-hit city of Tacloban showed vast stretches of land swept clean of homes and reports emerged of people who were desperate for food and water raiding aid convoys and stripping the stores that were left standing.         As Monday dawned it became increasingly clear that Typhoon Haiyan had ravaged cities towns and fishing villages when it played a deadly form of hopscotch across the islands of the central Philippines on Friday. By some estimates at least 10000 people may have died in Tacloban alone and with phone service out across stretches of the far-flung archipelago it was difficult to know if the storm was as deadly in more remote areas.         Barreling across palm-fringed beaches and plowing into frail homes with a force that by some estimates approached that of a tornado Haiyan delivered a crippling blow to this countrys midsection. The culprit increasingly appeared to be a storm surge that was driven by those winds which were believed to be among the strongest ever recorded in the Philippines lifting a wall of water onto the land as they struck. By some accounts the winds reached 190 miles an hour.         As aid crews struggled to reach ravaged areas the storm appeared to lay bare some of the perennial woes of the Philippines. The countrys roads and airports long starved of money by corrupt and incompetent governments are some of the worst in Southeast Asia and often make traveling long distances a trial. On Monday clogged with debris from splintered buildings and shattered trees the roads in the storms path were worse slowing rescue teams.         Richard Gordon the chairman of the Philippines Red Cross said that a Red Cross aid convoy to Tacloban had to turn back on Sunday after it stopped at a collapsed bridge and was nearly hijacked by a crowd of hungry people. There is very little food going in and what food there was was captured by the crowd Mr. Gordon said in a telephone interview on Monday morning.         The storm posed new challenges for President Benigno S. Aquino III who just two months ago struggled to wrest back a major city in the south from insurgents. Mr. Aquino has won plaudits at home and abroad for his fight against corruption during his three and a half years in office leading to increased foreign investment and an impressive growth rate. But he must still contend with Muslim separatists in the south and with provinces that have long been the domains of regional strongmen resistant to government control.         Now add to that list a storm that looks to be one of the countrys worst disasters at a time when emergency funds have been depleted by a series of other calamities most notably an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 that struck the middle of the country four weeks ago. On Monday after the reports of widespread raiding of stores and robberies and rising fears of a breakdown of law and order the government said it was flying more police officers to the region.         Although deadly storms are not unusual in the Philippines Typhoon Haiyan appears to stand apart both in the ferocity of its winds which some described as sounding like a freight train and in its type of destruction. Most deaths from typhoons in the Philippines are caused by mudslides and rivers flooding from heavy rains.         So when Haiyan sped across the islands on Friday some officials and weather experts in the Philippines thought they had witnessed something of a miracle. The storm that lit up social media for days with dire warnings was thought to have mostly spared the islands because it did not linger long enough to dump a deluge of rain.        
16,100000002575138,1,Article,News,U.S.,us,politics,"Inside the Race to Rescue a Health Care Site, and Obama",SHERYL GAY STOLBERG;MICHAEL D. SHEAR,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/us/politics/inside-the-race-to-rescue-a-health-site-and-obama.html,1,WASHINGTON  As a small coterie of grim-faced advisers shuffled into the Oval Office on the evening of Oct. 15 President Obamas chief domestic accomplishment was falling apart 24 miles away at a bustling high-tech data center in suburban Virginia.         HealthCare.gov the $630 million online insurance marketplace was a disaster after it went live on Oct. 1 with a roster of engineering repairs that would eventually swell to more than 600 items. The private contractors who built it were pointing fingers at one another. And inside the White House after initially saying too much traffic was to blame Mr. Obamas closest confidants had few good answers.         The political dangers were clear to everyone in the room: Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.;  We created this problem we didnt need to create Mr. Obama said according to one adviser who like several interviewed insisted on anonymity to share details of the private session. And its of our own doing and its our most important initiative.         Out of that tense Oval Office meeting grew a frantic effort aimed at rescuing not only the insurance portal and Mr. Obamas credibility but also the Democratic philosophy that an activist government can solve big complex social problems. Today that rescue effort is far from complete.         The website which the administration promised would function smoothly for most people by Nov. 30 remains a work in progress. It is more stable with many more people able to use it simultaneously than just two weeks ago. But it still suffers sporadic crashes and large parts of the vital back end that processes enrollment data and transactions with insurers remain unbuilt. The president who polls showed was now viewed by a majority of Americans  Another round of hardware upgrades and software fixes was planned for Saturday night. Administration officials say they will give a public update about the sites performance on Sunday morning.         The story of how the administration confronted one of the most perilous moments in Mr. Obamas presidency  drawn from documents and from interviews with dozens of administration officials lawmakers insurance executives and tech experts working inside the HealthCare.gov war room  reveals an insular White House that did not initially appreciate the magnitude of its self-inflicted wounds and sought help from trusted insiders as it scrambled to protect Mr. Obamas image.         After a month of bad publicity and intensifying Republican attacks the sense of crisis and damage control inside the White House peaked on Oct. 30 as the presidents top aides began to fully grasp the breadth of the political challenges they faced. As Ms. Sebelius was grilled by Congressional Republicans that day Mr. Obama flew to Boston to defend the health law and confront a  The day was a brutal reminder for top White House advisers that fixing the botched health care rollout would be critical to restoring their bosss agenda and legacy. To do that they would have to take charge of a project that they would come to discover had never been fully tested and was flailing in part because of the Medicare agencys decision not to hire a systems integrator that could coordinate its complex parts. The White House would also have to hold together a fragile alliance of Democratic lawmakers and insurance executives.         If we dont do that one senior White House adviser recalled its a very serious threat to the success of the legislation and a very serious threat to him. We get that.         The urgent race to fix the website  now playing out behind the locked glass doors of the closely guarded war room in Columbia Md.  has exposed a deeply dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and Human Services and its technology contractors and tensions between the White House chief of staff and senior health department officials. It strained relations between the Obama administration and the insurance industry helped revive a Republican Party battered after the two-week government shutdown and frustrated even infuriated Congressional Democrats.         But as the presidents team gathered on Oct. 15  with a budget deal finally in sight on Capitol Hill  his difficulties were only just becoming clear to the White House. As aides left the Oval Office that evening clutching notes filled with what Mr. McDonough called do-outs or assignments political pressure was mounting.

His windows were covered with black trash bags. He was preoccupied with violent video games and created a spreadsheet of some of the worst massacres in American history.         Mr. Lanza refused to speak even to his mother communicating with her only by email even though their bedrooms shared the same floor of their house on Yogananda Street.         He would not eat unless his food was arranged in a particular way on his plate. He hated birthdays and holidays and forbade his mother from putting up a Christmas tree.         He also made her get rid of a cat he did not like.         No one else was allowed into his room including his mother who nevertheless did her sons laundry daily because he changed his clothes often.         Among their few outings together were trips to the shooting range. She planned to buy him a gun for Christmas last year.         Mr. Lanza 20 could not connect with people but obsessed over Dance Dance Revolution an interactive video game he played in the lobby of a nearby movie theater spending as long as 10 hours at a time trying to follow dance routines as they flashed on the screen.         Last year four days before her son killed 20 first graders and six adults at  Ms. Lanza returned on Dec. 13 at 10 p.m.         The next morning her son shot and killed her in her bed.         A  But what it does not answer is why.         The long-awaited report does not suggest a motive for Mr. Lanzas actions even as it offers a glimpse into his strange troubled life. It comes nearly a year after the shooting set off a national discussion about gun control mental health and violence in American popular culture.         In that time families of the Sandy Hook Elementary victims have struggled to put their lives back together the town has tried to heal and the school has been razed. But until Monday little information compiled by investigators had been publicly released.         Even basic facts like the path Mr. Lanza took inside the school were kept secret.         After the shooting the Connecticut General Assembly passed bills to limit what could be made public. The state also fought to prevent the release of the recordings of the emergency calls to 911 from people inside the school. At a hearing on Monday before the reports release Judge Eliot Prescott of New Britain Superior Court said that he would review the tapes and soon decide whether to release them.         The report was based on voluminous evidence and interviews conducted by the Connecticut State Police and the states attorneys office along with federal authorities. It marks the end of the investigation.         Investigators struggled to make sense of contradictory descriptions of Mr. Lanza by those who knew him.         The report notes that while significant mental health issues affected his ability to live a normal life and interact with others it remained unclear if they contributed in any way to his actions last December. Mr. Lanza received a diagnosis in 2005 of an autism variant known as Aspergers syndrome but there is no evidence that people with Aspergers are more likely than others to commit violent crimes.         Mr. Lanza was treated by mental health professionals according to the report but none of them saw anything that predicted his future behavior.         Tutoring desensitization and medication were recommended the report said. The shooter refused to take suggested medication and did not engage in suggested behavior therapies.         There were reports of troubling behavior as early as the fifth grade when Mr. Lanza produced The Big Book of Granny for a class project. The main character had a gun in her cane and shot people.         In 2006 as a seventh grader Mr. Lanza was described by a teacher as intelligent but obsessed with violent imagery.

Check the Lulu App,DEBORAH SCHOENEMAN,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/fashion/social-networking-App-allows-women-to-rate-men.html,1,Not long ago after Alexandra Amin an assistant at Warner Brothers broke up with an agent she had been dating for a year her friend told her about a new free female-friendly social networking app that lets women anonymously review men who are their Facebook friends.         She was like Hes so crazy you should rate him on LuluÂ  said Ms. Amin 29 who lives in Los Angeles. Ms. Amin gave the ex hashtags including #NeverSleepsOver and #FriendZone. He scored a 6.9 out of 10 which she admitted was lower than he actually deserves.          Since it was started last year by Alexandra Chong who has a law degree from the London School of Economics the service has provided a sort of Take Back the Internet moment for young women who have come of age in an era of revenge porn and anonymous possibly ominous suitors. The thing that drew me to Lulu was that dating without a reference is the scariest thing you can do said Erin Foster 31 an actress and writer. Meeting someone out in the world when youre not in school or dont work with each other or have mutual friends  you have no idea what youre getting yourself into.         Ms. Chong 32 a former member of the Jamaica Fed Cup tennis team is now relocating Lulu from London to New York where she said the audience for her app had grown 600 percent in the last six months according to the analytics provider Mixpanel. The trendsetting capital for women is New York and thats where we need to be she said recently.

19,100000002545656,1,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Bloody End for Iranian Rockers Seeking Musical Freedom in U.S.,VIVIAN YEE;J. DAVID GOODMAN,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/nyregion/4-dead-in-brooklyn-murder-suicide-police-say.html,1,For their music they had risked the wrath of Irans government practicing American-style rock in makeshift soundproof studios and performing it in underground clubs and parking lots despite the threat of fines detention or arrest. Growing up together in Tehran they had found a sound: part punk part garage rock part their own invention.         The Yellow Dogs as the four Iranian musicians were known played in the shadows until 2009 when they appeared in a film about Irans underground music scene that garnered international attention. The next year they left for America finding their way to East Williamsburg Brooklyn where their tidy house became a hub for fellow musicians and Iranians.         Hailed as countercultural heroes in Iran they were a few musicians among many in Brooklyn working day and night to stay afloat playing in basements and lofts until they scored better gigs. And then suddenly in the early hours of Monday morning two of them and another musician were dead shot by another Iranian musician who then killed himself.         While the precise motive was unclear it seemed that money distrust and discord sown amid a tight fraternity of Iranian rock artists were to blame.         If the Yellow Dogs had begun to find success in Brooklyn  they were playing at venues like the Music Hall of Williamsburg and Brooklyn Bowl  the gunman Ali Akbar Mohammadi Rafie had joined his fellow Iranians in Brooklyn only to struggle. Though he had left Iran as part of another band the Free Keys who stayed at the Yellow Dogs house when they arrived in New York in 2011 his relations with both bands had frayed.         While they continued to live in Brooklyn he had moved to Ridgewood Queens less than two miles away. There were accusations that he had stolen money from the Free Keys who forced him to leave the band last year said John J. McCarthy the Police Departments chief spokesman. He was in the United States on a temporary worker visa.         Mr. Rafie tried to rejoin the group only to be rebuffed Mr. McCarthy said. Hes upset that hes not in the band he said.         The outlines provided by the police of the gunmans march through the East Williamsburg townhouse are chilling.         Mr. Rafie climbed to the Yellow Dogs house at 318 Maujer Street across adjacent roofs Mr. McCarthy said. On one investigators found an empty guitar case which they believe was used to transport the assault rifle he used in his attack.         He found his way to a third-floor landing of the home. There he fired once through a window into a living room striking and killing Ali Eskandarian 35 an Iranian-American singer songwriter and writer who had been living in the apartment above the Yellow Dogs.         Mr. Rafie then climbed inside found Arash Farazmand 28 the Yellow Dogs drummer in his bedroom and opened fire fatally shooting him. His brother Soroush Farazmand 27 the bands guitarist was in his second-floor bedroom on his bed and pecking away at his laptop. Mr. Rafie burst in and shot him in the chest killing him.         Shots appeared to have also been fired down a hallway and into a second-floor room striking Sasan Sadeghpourosko 22 another resident in the shoulder and elbow. On the third floor were a man and a woman members of the Coast Guard who had rented a room for Veterans Day events and Pooya Hosseini another Iranian musician from the Free Keys.         Mr. Rafie kicked in the door and he and Mr. Hosseini a former bandmate struggled over the rifle. Several shots went off. Unhurt Mr. Hosseini fled and Mr. Rafie headed to the roof where he shot himself in the head.         Mr. Sadeghpourosko a street artist was treated at Elmhurst Hospital Center and released. His brother who was also in the room was not injured.         The other members of the Yellow Dogs Koory Mirz the bassist and Siavash Karampour the lead singer known as Obash were not there at the time.         Before fleeing for the United States in 2010 the four bandmates belonged to Tehrans small but crazy underground club scene according to a State Department 
20,100000002570520,1,Article,News,World,world,middleeast,Obama Signals a Shift From Military Might to Diplomacy,MARK LANDLER,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/world/middleeast/longer-term-deal-with-iran.html,1,WASHINGTON  The weekend ended with the first tangible sign of a nuclear deal with Iran after more than three decades of hostility. Then on Monday came the announcement that a conference will convene in January to try to broker an end to the civil war in Syria.         The success of either negotiation both long sought by President Obama is hardly assured  in fact the odds may be against them. But the two nearly simultaneous developments were vivid statements that diplomacy the venerable but often-unsatisfying art of compromise has once again become the centerpiece of American foreign policy.         At one level the flurry of diplomatic activity reflects the definitive end of the post-Sept. 11 world dominated by two major wars and a battle against Islamic terrorism that drew the United States into Afghanistan and still keeps its Predator drones flying over Pakistan and Yemen.         But it also reflects a broader scaling-back of the use of American muscle not least in the Middle East as well as a willingness to deal with foreign governments as they are rather than to push for new leaders that better embody American values. Regime change in Iran or even Syria is out; cutting deals with former adversaries is in.         For Mr. Obama the shift to diplomacy fulfills a campaign pledge from 2008 that he would stretch out a hand to Americas enemies and speak to any foreign leader without preconditions. But it will also subject him to considerable political risks as the  Were testing diplomacy; were not resorting immediately to military conflict Mr. Obama said defending the Iran deal on Monday in San Francisco. Tough talk and bluster may be the easy thing to do politically  Still diplomacy is a protracted messy business with often inconclusive results. It is harder for a president to rally the American public behind a multilateral negotiation than a missile strike though the deep war weariness of Americans has reinforced Mr. Obamas instinct for negotiated settlements over unilateral action.         White House officials suggest that the president always planned to arrive at this moment and that everything that came before it  from the troop surge in Afghanistan to the commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden  was cleaning up after his predecessor.         In 2009 we had 180000 troops in two wars and a ton of legacy issues surrounding terrorism said Benjamin J. Rhodes a deputy national security adviser. So much that was done out of the box was winding down those wars. Weve shifted from a very military face on our foreign policy to a very diplomatic face on our foreign policy.         Much of that diplomacy has been on public display in the  But some of the crucial dealings have occurred in the shadows. In March administration officials said Mr. Obama authorized a small team of senior officials from the White House and the State Department to travel secretly to Oman the Arab sultanate where they met face to face with Iranian officials to explore the possibility of a nuclear deal.         The cloak-and-dagger was necessary the officials said because it allowed the United States and Iran to discuss the outlines of a nuclear deal without fear that details would leak out. Cutting out others eliminated the competing agendas that come with the six negotiating partners engaged in the formal Geneva talks.         But the disclosure that the United States and Iran had been talking privately angered France which registered its displeasure two weeks ago by warning that the proposal then being discussed was too lenient and that it would not accept a suckers deal.         For all of Mr. Obamas emphasis on diplomacy analysts noted that the United States often depends on others to take the initiative. In the case of Iran it was the election of Hassan Rouhani as president with his mandate to seek a relaxation of punishing sanctions.         In the case of Syria it was a Russian proposal for President Bashar al-Assad to turn over and destroy his chemical weapons stockpiles an option the White House seized on as a way of averting a military strike that Mr. Obama first threatened and then backed off from.        
21,100000002580128,1,Article,News,Health,health,,"As Hospital Prices Soar, a Stitch Tops $500",ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/03/health/as-hospital-costs-soar-single-stitch-tops-500.html,1,SAN FRANCISCO  With blood oozing from deep lacerations the two patients arrived at California Pacific Medical Centers tidy emergency room. Deepika Singh 26 had gashed her knee at a backyard barbecue. Orla Roche a rambunctious toddler on vacation with her family had tumbled from a couch splitting open her forehead on a table.         On a quiet Saturday in May nurses in blue scrubs quickly ushered the two patients into treatment rooms. The wounds were cleaned numbed and mended in under an hour. It was great  they had good DVDs the staff couldnt have been nicer said Emer Duffy Orlas mother.         Then the bills arrived. Ms. Singhs three stitches cost $2229.11. Orlas forehead was sealed with a dab of skin glue for $1696. When I first saw the charge I said What could possibly have cost that much?Â  recalled Ms. Singh. They billed for everything every pill.         In a medical system notorious for opaque finances and inflated bills nothing is more convoluted than hospital pricing economists say. Hospital charges represent about a third of the $2.7 trillion annual United States health care bill the biggest single segment  A day spent as an inpatient at an American hospital costs on average more than $4000 five times the charge in many other developed countries according to the  At Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City Daniel Diaz 29 a public relations executive was billed $3355.96 for five stitches on his finger after cutting himself while peeling an avocado. At a hospital in Jacksonville Fla. Arch Roberts Jr. 56 a former government employee was charged more than $2000 for three stitches after being bitten by a dog. At Mercy Hospital in Port Huron Mich. Chelsea Manning 22 a student received bills for close to $3000 for six stitches after she tripped running up a path. Insurers and patients negotiated lower prices but those charges were a starting point.         The main reason for high hospital costs in the United States economists say is fiscal not medical: Hospitals are the most powerful players in a health care system that has little or no price regulation in the private market.         Rising costs of drugs medical equipment and other services and fees from layers of middlemen play a significant role in escalating hospital bills of course. But just as important is that mergers and consolidation have resulted in a couple of hospital chains  like Partners in Boston or Banner in Phoenix  dominating many parts of the country allowing them to command high prices from insurers and employers.         Sutter Health California Pacific Medical Centers parent company operates more than two dozen community hospitals in Northern California almost all in middle-class or high-income neighborhoods. Its clout has helped California Pacific Medical Center the states largest private nonprofit hospital also earn the highest net income in California. Prices for many of the procedures at the San Francisco hospital are among the top 20 percent in the country according to a New York Times analysis of data released by the federal government.         Sutter is a leader  a pioneer  in figuring out how to amass market power to raise prices and decrease competition said Glenn Melnick a professor of health economics at the University of Southern California. How do hospitals set prices? They set prices to maximize revenue and they raise prices as much as they can  all the research supports that.         In other countries the price of a day in the hospital often includes many basic services. Not here. The chargemaster the price list created by each hospital typically has more than ten thousand entries and almost nothing  even an aspirin a bag of IV fluid or a visit from a physical therapist to help a patient get out of bed  is free. Those lists are usually secret but California requires them to be  California Pacific Medical Centers 400-page chargemaster for this year contains some eye-popping figures: from $32901 for an  Dr. Warren Browner the chief executive officer of California Pacific Medical Center said that there were good reasons that hospitals charged what they did: They must have highly trained professionals available 24 hours a day seven days a week. They must constantly upgrade to the latest equipment and building standards to meet patients expectations and state mandates. They charge paying or well-insured patients more to compensate for others they treat at a loss.         Hospital care is extremely expensive to produce and to have available for everyone in the community he said noting that hospitals needed to have a neurosurgeon on call in case a patient turned up with a blood clot on the brain. We take every penny of the revenue we earn and use it to build new and better facilities for everyone in the city.         Some health economists say that even though most hospitals are nonprofit they nonetheless are often flush with revenue and guilty of unnecessary spending.         Hospitals are self-fueling ever-expanding machines said James Robinson an economist and professor of health policy at the University of California Berkeley. There is an infinite amount of stuff to buy  amenities machines new wings higher salaries more nurses.         But he asked to deliver good health care what do you need?          There is little science to how hospitals determine the prices they print on hospital bills.         Chargemaster prices are basically arbitrary not connected to underlying costs or market prices said Professor Melnick the economist. Hospitals can set them at any level they want. There are no market constraints.         Prices for any item or service are set by each hospital and move up and down yearly and show extraordinary variability health economists say. The codeine that costs $20 and the bag of IV fluid that costs $137 at California Pacific are charged at $1 and $16 at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center across town. But U.C.S.F. Medical Center charges $1600 for an amniocentesis which costs $687 at California Pacific.         After each hospital stay or visit computer programs and human coders and billers use the chargemaster price list to translate the services rendered into a price. Sutter employs more than 1300 people at a special center in Roseville Calif. to perform this and other administrative tasks for its hospitals. Emergency room visits typically include separate charges for doctors services and for supplies as well as a facility fee  the charge for walking in the door.         Orla Roches bill for example included $529 for supplies and devices though her mother is perplexed about what those are: Orla left the emergency room with gauze wrapped round her head (under $1 at Internet supply stores) festooned with a pink cartoon sticker. According to the chargemaster price list for California Pacific a vial of skin glue is billed at $181 a tube of  The bill also included $1167 for the facility fee which was classified at Level 3  the middle of the scale though Orlas treatment was one of the most simple emergency room interventions. At Lenox Hill in New York Daniel Diazs unusually detailed bill for his stitches included $1828 for emergency room services $628 for repairing the wound $571.83 for application of a finger splint $97.10 for a  Economists note that hospitals can bill for emergency room care with relative impunity since injured patients generally rush to the nearest treatment facility. But worried about high prices even the sick sometimes shop around. When Jamie Burke 33 a graduate student in North Carolina came to after she was knocked out during a soccer game in April she started searching on her smartphone for an in-network hospital as a friend drove.         It was crazy she said but luckily I wasnt unconscious so I could figure it out.         She is glad she did: Though the hospital billed $5039 her insurers in-network contracted rate was about $2700. With copays and coinsurance she owed $600 for the visit.         The uninsured are particularly vulnerable to high prices since they have no one to argue on their behalf. When Arch Roberts Jr. got his bill of more than $2000 for stitches he explained that he was uninsured and his business had failed during the housing crisis so he could not afford the fee. The hospital offered him a charity care discount  a price that was still out of range. I dont have $800 to pay them any more than I have $2000 for three stitches he said noting that the hospital has been relentless in its collection efforts.          Once perennial money pits emergency rooms have become big moneymakers for most hospitals in the last decade experts say as they raised their fees and managed their patient mix. California Pacific Medical Center has nearly doubled its emergency room fees since 2005 its chargemaster price lists show.         California Pacifics emergency room is not a trauma center; poor or uninsured trauma patients who require lengthy inpatient stays can strain a hospital budget. And insurers allow emergency rooms to bill more than urgent-care centers for simple procedures like stitches or X-raying a sprained ankle making such procedures profitable. Indeed the financial prospects are so appealing that doctors groups in Texas are opening free-standing emergency rooms that are not connected to hospitals.         Hospitals see where theyre making money and try to do more of that said Dr. David Gifford a former health commissioner of Rhode Island who has studied how labs price their tests. He said that laboratory tests and X-rays are priced high and are profitable though there is no difference in quality from national commercial labs that charge far less. A blood count and blood electrolyte test  ordered every day for most inpatients and often in the emergency room  are priced at $259.06 and $293.25 on California Pacific Medical Centers chargemaster price list. Insurers often pay outside labs less than $10 for the services.         And like any business many hospitals try to do fewer services that are not well paid. In 2012 over loud patient protests California Pacific Medical Center outsourced its kidney  You need a Ph.D. in health economics to understand medical pricing said Dr. Browner who has acknowledged that California Pacifics chargemaster prices might appear high. But he added We have to recoup what it costs to keep open what it costs to take care of the un- and underinsured and to rebuild.         He said that MediCal Californias  Dr. Browner also pointed to what health care executives call the Saudi sheikh problem at some hospitals.         You dont really want to change your charges if you have a Saudi sheikh come in with a suitcase full of cash whos going to pay full charges he said.         But how much actual charity care does a hospital like California Pacific Medical Center perform? And are insurers and patients paying hospitals for better quality? Or also for amenities like valet parking useless medical gadgetry and inflated salaries?         Though hospitals nonprofit status allows them to reap tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in tax benefits California Pacific Medical Centers main campuses spent 1.27 percent of their more than $1.1 billion in net patient revenues in 2011 on free care for indigent or uninsured patients lower than the state average of 2.07 percent according to  Sutter based in Sacramento  California Pacific Sutters main campus is in upscale Pacific Heights. It has just broken ground on a $2.7 billion renovation which includes a new flagship hospital. Though the project was initiated to meet new state earthquake standards the facility is designed as a sleek glass and marble structure with all private rooms underground parking and roof gardens with flowers and bees to enhance the quality of the healing environment according to California Pacific Medical Centers website. Its Facebook page has called it the coolest hospital in San Francisco possibly the country and even the world.         Consumers may appreciate  or demand  features that contribute to bigger hospital bills. But studies have found no correlation between prices and patient outcomes. A California state rating of hospital services by  Its crosstown neighbor University of California San Francisco a nationally ranked academic institution charges far less per day than California Pacific when the greater severity of illnesses of its patients is factored in Professor Melnick said. In factÂ a recent study in the publication Annals of Surgery a monthly review of surgical science found that hospitals with the highest complication rates tended to have higher prices.         From such variations economists conclude that costs are highly discretionary noting that hospitals in other developed countries often provide high-quality care with better outcomes in comparatively no-frills environments. Said Dr. Robinson the Berkeley health economist: If you pay hospitals more they spend it. If you pay them less they adjust. The only way to pay less for health care  is to pay less for health care.         Hospital officials like to say that their list prices do not reflect what most patients actually pay because private and government insurers negotiate discounts. Simone Singh a professor of health management and policy at the University of Michigan estimated that insurers generally paid 40 to 50 percent of charges. But with powerful chains like Sutter prices are high and the discounts often are not so generous. Patients are left paying more.          For her three stitches at California Pacific Medical Center Deepika Singh ended up paying $768.56  a lot of money for a 26-year-old retail supply chain manager  of the $1813 rate her insurer negotiated for the approximately $2200 bill. Ms. Duffy owed $1366 after her insurers discount on 2-year-old Orlas $1700 bill since the family had not met its annual deductible. How much is that per minute? she asked.         Across California Sutter hospitals have proved expert at the business of medicine. Our members are very exercised about Sutter  it has increased prices disproportionately said David Lansky chief executive officer of the Pacific Business Group on Health which represents 60 of Californias biggest private employers in its health care negotiations. Sutter has been successful at leveraging their huge size in dictating not just price but contract terms.         Its major competitor is Kaiser a health maintenance organization that runs a closed network of hospitals and doctors. California Pacific Medical Center delivers more than half the babies in San Francisco and is the citys largest employer after Wells Fargo. Sutter contracts also include gag clauses that prevent employers from knowing what rates have been negotiated by their insurers on their behalf Mr. Lansky said.         Chuck Idelson a spokesman for the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy the research arm of the California Nurses Association said Sutter prices were 40 to 70 percent above its rivals for similar services. When Sutter bought Summit Hospital in Oakland in 1999 rates there went up  Terry Miller 62 a businessman in the Bay Area got a bill for $117000 for a two-night stay at California Pacific Medical Center to place a  The high prices have had a ripple effect across Northern California allowing smaller hospitals to charge more as well. Sutter is the tallest Sequoia and everyone goes up just underneath them a bit said Professor Melnick. He noted that hospital prices in California had more than doubled in the past decade after adjustment for inflation.         And payouts in the Pacific region for simple emergency room treatments  stitches a sprained ankle and an   In theory health care consolidation can lead to economies of scale but not if it produces complex supersize systems. Excess administrative costs accounted for about $190 billion of the $2.5 trillion medical bill of the United States in 2009 the Institute of Medicine estimated this year  money that could be used for other purposes.         There is a big flurry of consolidation and the effects depend on what the objective of the health care system is said Orry Jacobs of the health care consulting firm BDC Advisors. If the intent is to improve care and bend cost curves then networks can do so. If the objective is to corner the market and demand higher rates then that will happen. Indeed research shows that todays hospital mergers tend to drive up prices.         And employers have limited ability to fight back. Sutter operates the only hospital in some California cities. Beginning on Jan. 1 the University of California Berkeley will exclude Sutters two nearby hospitals from its plan because it could not reach a price agreement. The universitys employees will have to cross the bay or drive inland for in-network hospital treatment or pay more.         As is often the case in American medicine patients will decide if they are willing to pay the high price of care. Back home in New York City Orla Duffys head wound has healed nicely without further treatment. Deepika Singh had her stitches taken out at an urgent care clinic costing $25 with her copay during a business trip to Washington.         Daniel Diaz who had been treated at Lenox Hill Mr. Roberts and Amy Bernstein had no choice but to visit an emergency room this year for stitches. But they all refused to see a doctor for the follow-up.         The amount was outrageous for the time it took to put them in said Ms. Bernstein 54 a real estate lawyer from Long Island who cut herself cleaning knives while fixing a kitchen damaged by 
22,100000002539056,1,Article,News,Booming,booming,,The Sex Toys in the Attic,JOYCE WADLER,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/booming/the-sex-toys-in-the-attic.html,,Ive been thinking about an extremely beautiful sex toy an old boyfriend got me  I think it is on my mind because he is having heart surgery this week. This is how it is at a certain age; when you hear about an old boyfriend its not because he got married or got a great job it is because theyre threading tubes into his chest and doing an ablation on his heart.         This toy which was silver and shaped like a stylized banana was so complicated I never used it. Also you had to charge it for a few hours. It wasnt one of those things that charged with a discreet little light either; it blasted O-shaped strobe signals across a darkened room that could have been used to direct incoming flights at a small airport ideally one catering to businessmen whose wives had lost interest in sex years ago. Well thats what they all say isnt it?         As I have a personal code that says you do not use a sex toy given to you by one man with another (yes I do have a Puritan streak) and disliking it anyway I had stashed this thing in a big closet which is like deep space things go there and disappear forever. The other day I heard Sandra Bullock in there hollering.         But now with the old beaus surgery looming the toy  rather its disposal  was on my mind. This was a problem. It was not one of those unused household items you can donate to Housing Works; they dont even take sheets. Im an environmentally conscious person but I couldnt see taking it to old electronics day at Union Square. I could put it into the appropriate recycling bin on my floor but then the neighbors might figure it out: Its her. All day all night I hear buzzing coming out of that apartment. No wonder shes always smiling. I might try to dispose of it with the kitchen garbage hiding it with coffee grounds and dead things from the back of the refrigerator as I do old tax reports but then Id be in violation of the recycling law.         I know I know  I should have been one of those women who held out for diamonds.         But disposing of sex paraphernalia  actually all those embarrassing items you have stashed around the house  is something every boomer should be concerned about. The days are dwindling down to a precious few and some of you have a nasty cough. Do you want the people clearing out your house particularly your children to find those feathery metallic rubbery polymer blend items you ordered one drunken night a few months after youd been forced to take early retirement? Do you want them to know their big tough construction worker dad liked to dress up in heels and a boa and sing La La La from No Strings one of Richard Rodgerss weaker efforts?         You may be thinking What do I care what my friends or children find in the house? I will be beyond embarrassment I will be dead. But you are wrong. Doctors now know that the human sense of embarrassment can last up to two weeks after the heart stops beating. Consider this statement from a boomer named Stanley: I was lying on the operating table then I had a feeling of leaving my body and looking down at myself and all I could think was Is my gut really that big?  Look it up on the web.         I know no one likes to think about death. But just as the responsible person designates someone to make medical decisions in case he or she is incapacitated we should all have designated lets call them Eradicators to come over and clean the house after we expire. Remember Marilyn Monroe. Not that I can prove anything just saying. Your Eradicator should be given house keys a list of items to be destroyed and their hiding places  you dont want to be in intensive care screaming Back of the sock drawer! Theyll just increase your meds.         The truly considerate person will dispose of potentially humiliating or harmful items the moment he gets really sick like a married man I knew who gave his love letters from the other woman to a male friend before he went into the hospital. Then he got better and got the love letters back. Then he died which was a big mistake on his part though I hear it made for an interesting moment at the memorial when the widow spotted the other woman. Think of this as a cautionary tale. Horrible things can happen when you leave romantic mementos around the house.         There is no excuse however for careless or improper disposal such as my friend Herb and I were witness to many years ago in Greenwich Village when we spied a sex toy in the street  not on the sidewalk in the street. Id tell you what it was but I am trying to stay within newspaper guidelines: O.K. think adult seesaw.         Herb and I gaped long and hard at this thing first debating the anatomical possibilities (and you wonder what friends have to talk about after 40 years) then as in Law & Order trying to recreate the scene:         Had there been a lovers quarrel during which this humongous shillelagh had been tossed out of a cab? If that was the case why did the couple have the thing in the cab in the first place  stealing a kiss in the back seat is one thing but that? Had it slipped out of someones shopping bag and then even in the Village was he or she too embarrassed to pick it up?         Awful right? And imagine how much worse it would have been if it had been spotted when I was walking with a child.         Whats that thing in the street Auntie Joyce?         Its a grown-up thing sweetie. People buy them when they love each other very much. Or maybe not enough. One day when youre grown up a man will fall in love with you. When that happens bring up diamonds.

The countdown had begun and he prepared to dive into Deans Blue Hole hoping to reach 72 meters on a single inhalation with no fins or supplemental oxygen. He began sipping the air attempting to pack as much oxygen in his lungs as possible.         At 12:25 p.m. Sunday surrounded by 15 other athletes and observers as well as five safety divers he turned and submerged face first and looking like a human arrow shooting into the darkness on what would be the last dive of his life.         Officials for Vertical Blue a  Diving to that depth with no fins thats a hard physical dive said Mike Board the British record-holder. I was thinking O.K. hes going to have a hard time getting up.         Still Mevoli shot to the surface under his own power after a dive of 3 minutes 38 seconds. Thats when the scene turned nightmarish.         Mevoli ripped off his goggles flashed the O.K. sign and attempted to complete the surface protocol that would make his attempt official by saying I am O.K. But he wasnt. His words were garbled his eyes wide and blank. He tipped backward into the ocean and lost consciousness which while alarming is not unheard-of in a sport in which almost all the top athletes have lost consciousness at one time or another though usually for only a few seconds. Mevoli was not so fortunate.         Five safety divers one of them an Australian paramedic and all certified in life support techniques hefted him onto a nearby platform where the event physician Barbara Jeschke of Germany went to work trying to revive him.         Theres a problem with his lung shouted Marco Cosentino of Italy one of the safety divers who meet the competitors at various stages to help bring them to the surface if they are in distress. They turned Mevoli onto his side and blood began pouring from his mouth and pooling on the platform before dissipating into the sea.         At first there was a pulse at times faint at times strong. Within 15 minutes there was none. The team cut off his wetsuit and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation in earnest. Attempts to revive Mevoli which included three shots of adrenaline at the scene continued unsuccessfully for the next 90 minutes.         Mevoli 32 from Williamsburg Brooklyn was a relative newcomer to the sport. When he dived to 100 meters in May he became the first American to break that barrier unassisted. He used a monofin that day and completed the feat in 3:45. It is this type of free diving  rather than the variety known as variable weight which uses a sled to take divers deeper than they could ever get on their own  that has exploded in popularity in recent years. Internationally free-diving schools are multiplying in destinations as wide-ranging as Hawaii Egypt Indonesia Greece and the Bahamas.         Vertical Blue considered the Wimbledon of free diving is an annual event that attracts the sports top athletes. It is held in a unique arena: Deans Blue Hole a narrow 200-meter-deep limestone pit the deepest of its kind in the world. It is set in a cove backed by cliffs that spill into a turquoise bay. The bay laps the shore of an egg noodle of an island that is 72 miles long home to 4000 people and under the tourism radar.         This year 34 athletes came to compete representing 16 countries with 26 national records set in the first six days of a competition that was scheduled to end on Tuesday. Athletes compete in 
24,HCD/KEuUcIEWARm2vzHDkw,1,Blogs,Blog Post,Health,Health,well,Why a Brisk Walk Is Better,GRETCHEN REYNOLDS,,http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/why-a-brisk-walk-is-better/,,Walking fast or slow is wonderful exercise. But now a first-of-its-kind study shows that to get the most health benefits from walking many of us need to pick up the pace. The findings stem from a new analysis of the National Walkers’ Health Study a large database of information maintained at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory about thousands of middle-age men and women who walk regularly for exercise. Recruited beginning in 1998 at walking events and from lists of subscribers to walking-related publications these volunteers filled out a lengthy survey about their typical walking distance and pace as well as their health history and habits. As most of us would likely guess walking is the most popular physical activity in America. But people who walk for exercise do so at wildly varying speeds and intensities. Some stroll at a leisurely 2 miles per hour which is low-intensity exercise. Others zip along at twice that pace or better resulting in a sweatier workout.  Exercise guidelines generally suggest that for health purposes people should engage in 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days of the week. For walkers a moderately intense pace would probably be about 15 or 16 minutes per mile. It has generally been assumed that if people walk more slowly but expend the same total energy as brisk walkers — meaning that they spend more time walking — they should gain the same health benefits. But few large-scale studies have directly compared the impact of moderate- and light-intensity walking especially in terms of longevity.    To do so Paul T. Williams a statistician at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory gathered data about 7374 male and 31607 female participants from the walkers’ health study who represented almost every speed of fitness walker from sluggish to swift. His findings were  Dr. Williams divided participants into four numerically equal categories based on their normal pace. Those in Category 1 the fleetest averaged less than 13.5 minutes per mile putting them on the cusp of jogging while those in Category 4 the slowest strolled at a relatively dilatory 17 minutes or more per mile. The majority of the walkers in this group in fact required at least 20 minutes to complete a mile and many had a pace of 25 minutes or more per mile. (Interestingly on average female walkers were faster than men in all of the categories.)  Next Dr. Williams cross-referenced his data against that in the essential if somewhat ghoulish National Death Index to determine which of the almost 39000 walkers had died in the decade or so since they had joined the survey and from what. It turned out that nearly 2000 of the walkers had died. More telling these deaths disproportionately were clustered among the slowest walkers. Those in Category 4 were about 18 percent more likely to have died from any cause than those in the other three categories and were particularly vulnerable to deaths from heart disease and dementia.  Unexpectedly the death rate remained high among the slowest walkers even if they met or exceeded the standard exercise guidelines and expended as much energy per day as someone walking briskly for 30 minutes. This effect was most pronounced among the slowest of the slow walkers whose pace was 24 minutes per mile or higher. They were 44 percent more likely to have died than walkers who moved faster even if they met the exercise guidelines. One important inference of these statistics is that intensity matters if you are walking for health. “Our results do suggest that there is a significant health benefit to pursuing a faster pace” Dr. Williams said. Pushing your body he said appears to cause favorable physiological changes that milder exercise doesn’t replicate. But there are nuances and caveats to that conclusion. The slowest walkers may have harbored underlying health conditions that predisposed them to both a tentative walking pace and early death. But that possibility underscores a subtle takeaway of the new study Dr. Williams said. Measuring your walking speed he pointed out could provide a barometer of your health status.  So check yours your spouse’s or perhaps your parents’ pace. The process is easy. Simply find a 400-meter track and using a stopwatch have everyone walk at his or her normal speed. If a circuit of the track takes someone 6 minutes or more that person’s pace is 24 minutes per mile or slower and he or she might consider consulting a doctor about possible health issues Dr. Williams said.  Then with medical clearance the slow walkers probably should try ramping up their speed gradually.  The most encouraging news embedded in the new study is that longevity rises with small improvements in pace. The walkers in Category 3 for instance moved at a speed only a minute or so faster per mile than some of those in the slowest group but they enjoyed a significant reduction in their risk of dying prematurely.

Pentagon officials said Tuesday that the B-52s were on a routine training mission planned long in advance of the Chinese announcement on Saturday that it was  A senior Pentagon official said that the mission overnight Monday from Guam was a demonstration of long-established international rights to freedom of navigation and transit through international airspace. The official said the unilateral Chinese declaration of expanded control was provocative and only increases the risk of miscalculation in the region.         There was no immediate Chinese response to the flights conducted without prior notification as demanded under the new declaration from Beijing which asserted the right to identify monitor and possibly take military action against any aircraft that enter the area. The unexpected announcement by China was among its boldest moves yet in a struggle for power in Asia with the United States and by extension its regional allies including Japan. The United States long the dominant power in the region has been scrambling to shore up its influence there promising in what it called a pivot to Asia in 2011 to refocus its energies after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan diverted its time and resources.         Having Japan in the mix only adds volatility. The country has its own tangled history with China which has sped past Japan as an economic power and which retains bitter memories of imperial Japans military invasion last century. Under its conservative leader Shinzo Abe Japan has refused to back down in the dispute with China over the uninhabited islands which Japan has long controlled.         For the White House the flare-up could prove a major distraction for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as he embarks on a weeklong tour of China Japan and South Korea. Administration officials are eager to focus on issues like North Korea and an American-led trans-Pacific trade deal meant to bolster economic ties in the region even as China woos its neighbors with aid and investment.         The islands called the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China are currently administered by the Japanese who consider the airspace above the islands to be theirs. American officials have been increasingly worried about the standoff which they fear could lead to conflict. By treaty the United States is obligated to defend Japan if it is attacked.         But both China and Americas Asian allies know that Washingtons focus has been elsewhere a reality that became evident when President Obama had to cancel a trip to an Asian summit meeting during the recent American government shutdown.         Pressed on whether the Chinese move represents an overt attempt to fill an American security void in the region Pentagon officials responded by pointing to the American response to the catastrophic typhoon that struck the Philippines this month. The United States quickly moved in hundreds of Marines dozens of transport aircraft and an entire aircraft carrier strike group.  However Mr. Obama is fielding a new national security team with views on Asia that are still coalescing and with relatively little experience in the region.         In her first major speech on Asia policy last week Mr. Obamas national security adviser Susan E. Rice did not mention the mutual defense clause in the treaty between the United States and Japan  an omission her colleagues dismissed as irrelevant since American officials reiterate it religiously but which troubled some in Japan.         But Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel wasted no time in responding to the initial Chinese declaration issuing a statement on Saturday reiterating that the United States was steadfast in our commitments to our allies and partners. He also repeated that the mutual defense treaty with Japan applies to the disputed islands.         American officials said Tuesday that the United States military would continue to stage a standard cycle of training flights over the East China Sea. The flight by the bombers was first reported Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal.         The move by China on Saturday appeared to be another step in its efforts to intensify pressure on Japan over the contested islands. In the past year Chinese paramilitary ships have made almost daily incursions into the waters around the islands including waters claimed by Japan. The incursions have led to a constant game of cat-and-mouse on the high seas in which the Japanese Coast Guard pursues the Chinese ships with both sides using bullhorns and electronic sign boards to tell the other to stay out of its territorial waters.        
26,100000002547646,1,Article,News,World,world,asia,"With Glut of Lonely Men, China Has an Approved Outlet for Unrequited Lust",DAN LEVIN,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/world/asia/with-glut-of-lonely-men-china-has-an-approved-outlet-for-unrequited-lust.html,8,GUANGZHOU China  Slack-jawed and perspiring Chen Weizhou gazed at a pair of life-size female dolls clad just barely in lingerie and lace stockings. Above these silicone vixens an instructional video graphically depicted just how realistic they felt once undressed.         A 46-year-old tour bus driver Mr. Chen had come earlier this month to the Guangzhou National Sex Culture Festival for fun which was not how he described intimacy with his wife who did not attend. When youre young sex is so mysterious but once youre married it gets really bland he said barely taking his eyes off the screen.         With an official theme of healthy sex happy families the 11th annual exposition sought to remedy the plight of Chinese men like Mr. Chen  and their wives if they are married.         The overwhelming presence of men at the festival mirrored a demographic imbalance in China where decades of the one-child rule and a cultural preference for sons combined with illegal sex-selective abortions have distorted the countrys gender ratio to 118 newborn boys for every 100 girls in 2012 rather than the normal 103 boys. In Guangdong Province home to a migrant worker population of 30 million  Chinas largest  the scarcity of women leaves bachelors with limited options.         Filling an exhibition center here in the capital of Guangdong in southern China the festival was a three-day mating ritual between capitalism and hedonism all diligently observed by that most prudish of chaperones: the Chinese government. Erotic possibilities abounded including a transgender fashion show sliced deer antler marketed as an aphrodisiac naughty nurse costumes and some flesh-color objects disconcertingly called Captain Stabbing.         Three decades after China began shedding its priggish Mao-era mores sex is now a big business here. Across the country pink-lit hair salons staffed by provocatively garbed women compete with massage parlors and late-night paid companions who slip their business cards under hotel room doors. Those looking to enhance their encounters can shop at countless adult health product stores and on the Internet.         Most of the inventory is made in China. According to state news media more than 1000 Chinese companies manufacture around 70 percent of the worlds sex toys generating $2 billion a year as of 2010.         The bounty of carnal titillation must contend with the firm hand of the Communist Party which bans pornography and punishes those guilty of group licentiousness in the name of protecting traditional Chinese values. But the partys moral authority has frayed of late because of the publicized antics of its friskier members. In June a government official was sentenced to 13 years in prison for corruption after a video surfaced showing him in bed with an 18-year-old woman. His fall came three months after photos depicting a coterie of six naked people including a party official and his wife exploded on the Internet.         In an attempt to give the sex festival a veneer of respectability government-run medical organizations sponsored booths in a side room which were unsurprisingly desolate. The main draw was lust.         Thousands of visitors nearly all middle-aged men wielding cameras poured through the aisles in search of any visible flesh. Guys have been taking my picture all day said a bikini-clad model Liang Lin 23 who was hugging her bare midriff defensively as a throng of men jostled desperately to get a better shot.         Not far away a male crowd waited for a diminutive Japanese pornography star named Rei Mizuna to appear. When she finally emerged from a dressing room to hand out racy autographed photos her frenzied fans surged forward with such zeal they shattered a glass display case.         Those unrequited desires have helped spawn a booming domestic sex toy industry. A stuffed man doesnt know what its like to be hungry explained a salesman at one booth filled with inflatable dolls. Just then an older gentleman approached and tried to bargain over an $8 figure with black tresses and a vacant stare.        
27,100000002591415,1,Article,News,World,world,europe,Protesters in Kiev Topple Lenin Statue as Rallies Grow,DAVID M. HERSZENHORN;ANDREW E. KRAMER,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/world/europe/kiev-teems-with-pro-europe-protesters-as-thousands-more-gather.html,1,KIEV Ukraine  Public protests thundered into a full-throttle civil uprising in Ukraine on Sunday as hundreds of thousands of protesters answered President Viktor F. Yanukovichs dismissiveness with their biggest rally so far demanding that he and his government resign.         At the height of the unrest on Sunday night a seething crowd toppled and smashed a statue of Lenin the most prominent monument to the Communist leader in Kiev. The act was heavy with symbolism underscoring the protesters rage at Russia over its role in the events that first prompted the protests: Mr. Yanukovichs abrupt refusal to sign sweeping political and free-trade agreements with the European Union.         After an electrifying assembly in Independence Square in the center of Kiev the main focus of the protests the huge crowd surged across the capital erecting barriers to block the streets around the presidential headquarters and pitching huge tents in strategic intersections. They were not challenged by the police who have largely disengaged since their bloody crackdown on a group of protesters on Nov. 30 sharply increased outrage at the government.         International concern over the unrest in Ukraine appeared to deepen on Sunday as the United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon telephoned Mr. Yanukovich and Western leaders continued to call on him to respond to the demonstrators demands. The European Union has been eager to draw Ukraine a nation of 46 million into closer alliance with the West while Russia has sought to safeguard its major economic and political interests in its close neighbor. Making the crisis more acute Ukraine is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy and is desperate for financial assistance from abroad.         The spreading disorder set off a new round of speculation that Mr. Yanukovich would declare a state of emergency and potentially turn again to force by ordering the removal of demonstrators who have occupied Independence Square and several public buildings including Kievs City Hall. There were reports on Sunday that the security services were preparing to bring charges of treason against three opposition leaders in Parliament who have been at the forefront of the demonstrations.         One of those leaders Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk of the opposition Fatherland party called for mass civil disobedience if Mr. Yanukovich tried to impose martial law. In the case that a state of emergency is declared everyone should go to Maidan Mr. Yatsenyuk said referring to Independence Square.         Mr. Yanukovich only added to the demonstrators anger by stopping on his way back from China on Friday to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Sochi the Russian resort city. Rumors immediately began swirling that Mr. Yanukovich had cut a secret economic deal with Mr. Putin that would lead to Ukraine joining a customs union with Russia Belarus and Kazakhstan a step that many Ukrainians believe would deliver their countrys future into the Kremlins hands. Both governments denied the rumors but the protesters do not trust either Mr. Putin or Mr. Yanukovich and opposition leaders used the matter on Sunday to whip up the crowd in Kiev.         Today they fall on their knees in front of the president of Russia and surrender us to the customs union said Oleg Tyagnibok the leader of the nationalist Svoboda Party. We demand to make public what these secret negotiations were about. They bring us back to the time of Stalinism. Is this 1937?         Later as the Lenin statue was pulled down and men took turns splintering it to bits with a sledgehammer protesters twice sang the national anthem removing their caps and covering their hearts with their hands. One of the hammerers wore his hair in a mohawk; another was a priest in black vestments. Onlookers shielded their faces from the flying granite chips as they cheered them on yelling: Good job guys.         A spokesman for Prime Minister Mykola Azarov called the statues destruction barbaric.

The professors Dr. Paul M. Ridker and Dr. Nancy Cook had pointed out the problems a year earlier when the National Institutes of Healths National Heart Lung and Blood Institute which originally was developing the guidelines sent a draft to each professor independently to review. Both reported back that the calculator was not working among the populations it was tested on by the guideline makers.         That was unfortunate because the committee thought the researchers had been given the professors responses said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones co-chairman of the guidelines task force and chairman of the department of  Drs. Ridker and Cook saw the final guidelines and risk calculator on Tuesday at 4 p.m. when a news embargo was lifted and saw that the problems remained.         On Saturday night members of the association and the college of cardiology held a hastily called closed-door meeting with Dr. Ridker who directs the Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston. He showed them his data and pointed out the problem. On Sunday officials from the organizations struggled with how to respond.         Other experts said there has not been a real appreciation of the difficulties with this and other risk calculators. I dont think people have a good idea of what needs to be done said Dr. Michael Blaha director of clinical research at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University who was not associated with forming the new guidelines.         Dr. Blaha said the problem might have stemmed from the fact that the calculator uses as reference points data collected more than a decade ago when more people smoked and had strokes and heart attacks earlier in life. For example the guideline makers used data from studies in the 1990s to determine how various risk factors like cholesterol levels and  But people have changed in the past few decades Dr. Blaha said. Among other things there is no longer such a big gap between womens risks and those of men at a given age. And people get heart attacks and strokes at older ages.         The cohorts were from a different era Dr. Blaha said.         This week after they saw the guidelines and the calculator Dr. Ridker and Dr. Cook evaluated it using three large studies that involved thousands of people and continued for at least a decade. They knew the subjects characteristics at the start  their ages whether they smoked their cholesterol levels their blood pressures. Then they asked how many had heart attacks or strokes in the next 10 years and how many would the risk calculator predict.         The answer was that the calculator overpredicted risk by 75 to 150 percent depending on the population. A man whose risk was 4 percent for example might show up as having an 8 percent risk. With a 4 percent risk he would not warrant treatment  the guidelines that say treatment is advised for those with at least a 7.5 percent risk and that treatment can be considered for those whose risk is 5 percent.        
29,100000002543415,1,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,Is It O.K. to Kill Cyclists?,DANIEL DUANE,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/is-it-ok-to-kill-cyclists.html,6,SAN FRANCISCO  EVERYBODY who knows me knows that I love cycling and that Im also completely freaked out by it. I got into the sport for middle-aged reasons: fat; creaky knees; the delusional vanity of tight shorts. Registering for a triathlon I took my first ride in decades. Wind in my hair smile on my face I decided instantly that I would bike everywhere like all those beautiful hipster kids on fixies. Within minutes however I watched an S.U.V. hit another cyclist and then I got my own front wheel stuck in a streetcar track sending me to the pavement.         I made it home alive and bought a stationary bike trainer and workout DVDs with the ex-pro Robbie Ventura guiding virtual rides on Wisconsin farm roads so that I could sweat safely in my California basement. Then I called my buddy Russ one of 13500 daily bike commuters in Washington D.C. Russ swore cycling was harmless but confessed to awakening recently in a Level 4 trauma center having been hit by a car he could not remember. Still Russ insisted I could avoid harm by assuming that every driver was a mouth-breathing drug addict with a murderous hatred for cyclists.         The anecdotes mounted: my wifes childhood friend was cycling with Mom and Dad when a city truck killed her; two of my fathers law partners maimed. I began noticing cyclist killed news articles like one about Amelie Le Moullac 24 pedaling inside a bike lane in San Franciscos SOMA district when a truck turned right and killed her. In these articles I found a recurring phrase: to quote from The San Francisco Chronicle story about Ms. Le Moullac The truck driver stayed at the scene and was not cited.         In stories where the driver had been cited the penaltys meagerness defied belief like the teenager in 2011 who drove into the 49-year-old cyclist John Przychodzen from behind on a road just outside Seattle running over and killing him. The police issued only a $42 ticket for an unsafe lane change because the kid hadnt been drunk and as they saw it had not been driving recklessly.         You dont have to be a lefty pinko cycling activist to find something weird about that. But try a Google search for cyclist + accident and you will find countless similar stories: on Nov. 2 for example on the two-lane coastal highway near Santa Cruz Calif. a northbound driver lost control and veered clear across southbound traffic killing Joshua Alper a 40-year-old librarian cycling in the southbound bike lane. As usual: no charges no citation. Most online comments fall into two camps: cyclists outraged at inattentive drivers and wondering why cops dont care; drivers furious at cyclists for clogging roads and flouting traffic laws.         My own view is that everybodys a little right and that were at a scary cultural crossroads on the whole car/bike thing. American cities are dense enough  and almost half of urban car trips short enough under three miles  that cities from Denver to Miami are putting in bike-share programs. If theres one thing New York Citys incoming and departing mayors agree on its the need for more bike lanes.         The American Medical Association endorses National Bike to Work Day and more than 850000 people commute on a bicycle according to the  But the social and legal culture of the American road not to mention the road itself hasnt caught up. Laws in most states do give bicycles full access to the road but very few roads are designed to accommodate bicycles and the speed and mass differentials  bikes sometimes slow traffic only cyclists have much to fear from a crash  make sharing the road difficult to absorb at an emotional level. Nor does it help that many cyclists do ignore traffic laws. Every time I drive my car through San Francisco I see cyclists running stop signs like immortal entitled fools. So I understand the impulse to see cyclists as recreational risk takers who deserve their fate.

Blanketed with giddy images drawing street artists from around the world  But early Tuesday under the cover of night painters quietly blanketed much of the walls of 5Pointz with whitewash erasing the work of hundreds and seemingly putting the final nail in the long battle between the buildings owners who plan to erect luxury apartments and the artists who fought to save it.         This is the biggest rag and disrespect in the history of graffiti said a teary-eyed Marie Cecile Flaguel a spokeswoman for the group behind 5Pointz which sprang like a rainbow from the gray sidewalks near Jackson Avenue in Long Island City. Hes painted over the work of at least 1500 artists.         The owner of the buildings Jerry Wolkoff however said painting over the artwork was the humane thing to do. A recent order by a federal judge allows him to move forward with his plans to demolish the buildings by years end and he said watching the art-covered walls be pulled down piece by piece would be torture.         He also wanted to avoid a confrontation adding that there would be a 60-foot-high wall near the new towers where graffiti painters can work again.         I am telling you I did not like what they did  I loved what they did said Mr. Wolkoff who bought the buildings in 1971 and plans to build high-rise towers in their stead. I cried this morning I swear to you.         Yet many supporters of 5Pointz which became so well established that tourists flocked to it by the busload saw the clandestine erasing as a cruel vindictive move.         The fact that they destroyed the art before they razed the building its a really big slap in the face said Eric Felisbret an expert on street art and the author of Graffiti New York. So many people put so much passion and energy into it.         Though there are other spots in New York City where graffiti artists could legally work Mr. Felisbret said Theres nothing that was as large and that big of a draw internationally as 5Pointz.         Forty years ago after buying the buildings which were mostly abandoned at the time Mr. Wolkoff leased the space to a company that made record player accessories then eight-track tapes and then CD covers before moving out in the early 1990s.         Casting about for new tenants Mr. Wolkoff rented studios to artists for a few hundred dollars a month. Around that time he was also approached by a man who removed graffiti from buildings around the city and wanted to know if the painters could use Mr. Wolkoffs walls as canvases. Liking their work Mr. Wolkoff gave them more and more space. In 2002 a graffiti artist named Meres One took the endeavor over becoming its curator and christening it 5Pointz.         Five stories high the buildings occupied most of a city block a playful wacky visual counterpoint to the solemn low-slung MoMA PS 1 site across the street. The canary yellow walls were covered with constantly changing artwork  Brobdingnagian bubble letters colorful cartoons and meticulously wrought images created by painters from France Italy Japan and beyond. Stepping into 5Pointzs interior courtyard was like plunging into a lurid fever dream.         Though street art is meant to be temporary 5Pointz became known as a graffiti museum. And the medium itself once considered a symbol of urban unraveling became a sought after gallery-worthy commodity with work from street artists like Banksy commanding millions of dollars. Which is one of the reasons the whitewashing of 5Pointzs walls was greeted with such vociferous dismay. What?! What did they do?! cried a tour guide named Hans Von Rittern as he raced out of a tour bus early Tuesday his arms wide his face crumpling as soon as he caught sight of Ms. Flaguel. They embraced tightly and wept.        
31,100000002577238,1,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,,Obamacare’s Secret Success,PAUL KRUGMAN,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/29/opinion/krugman-obamacares-secret-success.html,39,The law establishing Obamacare was officially titled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. And the affordable bit wasnt just about subsidizing premiums. It was also supposed to be about bending the curve  slowing the seemingly inexorable rise in health costs.         Much of the Beltway establishment scoffed at the promise of cost savings. The prevalent attitude in Washington is that reform isnt real unless the little people suffer; serious savings are supposed to come from things like  So hows it going? The health exchanges are off to a famously rocky start but many though by no means all of the cost-control measures have already kicked in. Has the curve been bent?         The answer amazingly is yes. In fact  O.K. the obligatory caveats. First of all we dont know how long the good news will last. Health costs in the United States slowed dramatically in the 1990s (although not this dramatically) probably thanks to the rise of health maintenance organizations but cost growth picked up again after 2000. Second we dont know for sure how much of the good news is because of the Affordable Care Act.         Still the facts are striking. Since 2010 when the act was passed real health spending per capita  that is total spending adjusted for overall inflation and population growth  has risen less than a third as rapidly as its long-term average. Real spending per Medicare recipient hasnt risen at all; real spending per Medicaid beneficiary has actually fallen slightly.         What could account for this good news? One obvious answer is the still-depressed economy which might be causing people to forgo expensive medical care. But this explanation turns out to be problematic in multiple ways. For one thing the economy had stabilized by 2010 even if the recovery was fairly weak yet health costs continued to slow. For another its hard to see why a weak economy would have more effect in reducing the prices of health services than it has on overall inflation. Finally Medicare spending shouldnt be affected by the weak economy yet it has slowed even more dramatically than private spending.         A better story focuses on what appears to be a decline in some kinds of medical innovation  in particular an absence of expensive new blockbuster drugs even as existing drugs go off-patent and can be replaced with cheaper generic brands. This is a real phenomenon; it is in fact the main reason the Medicare drug program has ended up costing less than originally projected. But since drugs are only about 10 percent of health spending it can only explain so much.         So what aspects of Obamacare might be causing health costs to slow? One clear answer is the acts reduction in Medicare overpayments  mainly a reduction in the subsidies to private insurers offering Medicare Advantage Plans but also cuts in some provider payments. A less certain but likely source of savings involves changes in the way Medicare pays for services. The program now penalizes hospitals if many of their patients end up being readmitted soon after being released  an indicator of poor care  and readmission rates have in fact fallen substantially. Medicare is also encouraging a shift from fee-for-service in which doctors and hospitals get paid by the procedure to accountable care in which health organizations get rewarded for overall success in improving care while controlling costs.         Furthermore theres evidence that Medicare savings spill over to the rest of the health care system  that when Medicare manages to slow cost growth private insurance gets cheaper too.         And the biggest savings may be yet to come.  The news on health costs is in short remarkably good. You wont hear much about this good news until and unless

She yelled for her husband to come look. Hes like I dont want to see my neighbor nakedÂ  she said. Im like No no you have to see. But by the time he came she was gone and he didnt believe me.         Credibility was restored as the sightings increased in frequency and began to involve other family members: the husband taking naked smoking breaks; the couple and their two young children dining alfresco and au natural.         The husband was grilling naked Ms. Sessoms said. Thats a little dangerous.         Ms. Sessoms was recalling these events on an unseasonably warm fall afternoon a few weeks ago on the same balcony that overlooks her neighbors yard. It was the kind of day a reporter pointed out that a nudist might regard as an invitation for a late-season frolic.         We were really excited about this balcony Ms. Sessoms said looking across at her neighbors yard warily. We dont enjoy it as much as we thought we would.         In a city like New York where residents live in such close proximity nudity is an often unavoidable part of domestic life. The living room window of one apartment faces the bedroom of another which has an unobstructed view into the bathroom of a third. Many of the citys interiors  especially those of some of the newer glass-sheathed buildings  afford all the privacy of a gym locker room.

Over the years she said she has noticed one resident in particular: My window looks straight into his bedroom and he never closes his curtains or shades. Hes reliably naked. (She asked that her employer go unnamed so as not to embarrass the man.)

Most residents of big apartment buildings are skilled at the half-naked dash to the hall closet and back or the shirtless plunge into the hallway for the Sunday paper.         We all stumble out in the morning Ms. Schulman said of the residents of her Upper West Side building. If our neighbor comes out in boxers or a T-shirt I say Oh weve all seen it already.Â 

His humility his compassion and his humanity earned him their love.         Mr. Zuma called Mr. Mandelas death the moment of our deepest sorrow and said that South Africas thoughts were now with the former presidents family. They have sacrificed much and endured much so that our people could be free he said.         Mr. Mandela spent 27 years in prison after being convicted of treason by the white minority government only to forge a peaceful end to white rule by negotiating with his captors after his release in 1990. He led the African National Congress long a banned liberation movement to a resounding electoral victory in 1994 the first fully democratic election in the countrys history.         Mr. Mandela who was 95 served just one term as South Africas president and had not been seen in public since 2010 when the nation hosted the soccer World Cup. But his decades in prison and his insistence on forgiveness over vengeance made him a potent symbol of the struggle to end this countrys brutally codified system of racial domination and of the power of peaceful resolution in even the most intractable conflicts.         Years after he retreated from public life his name still resonated as an emblem of his effort to transcend decades of racial division and create what South Africans called a Rainbow Nation.         His commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him set an example that all humanity should aspire to a grim President Obama said Thursday evening describing Mr. Mandela as an influential courageous and profoundly good man who inspired millions  including himself  to a spirit of reconciliation.         Mr. Mandela and Mr. Obama both served as the first black leaders of their nations and both men won the Nobel Peace Prize. But the American president has shied away from comparisons often noting that his own sacrifices would never compare to the ones that Mr. Mandela endured.         Mr. Obama said that the world would not likely see the likes of Nelson Mandela again and he noted that the former South African president had once said that he was not a saint unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.         Mr. Zuma did not announce the specific cause of Mr. Mandelas death but he had battling pneumonia and other lung ailments for the past six months and had been in and out of the hospital. Though his death was announced close to midnight when most in this nation of early risers are asleep a small crowd quickly gathered outside the house where he once lived in Soweto on Vilekazi Street.         Nelson Mandela there is no one like you they sang stamping their feet in unison to a praise song usually sung in joy. But in the midnight darkness sadness tinged the melody.         He was our father our mother our everything said Numfundo Matli 28 a housekeeper who joined the impromptu celebration of Mr. Mandelas life. What will we do without him?         His death comes during a period of deep unease and painful self-examination for South Africa.         In the past year and a half the country has faced perhaps its most serious unrest since the end of apartheid provoked by a wave of wildcat  Scandals over corruption involving senior members of the party have fed a broader perception that Mr. Mandelas near saintly legacy from the years of struggle has been eroded by a more recent scramble for self-enrichment among a newer elite.         After spending decades in penurious exile many political figures returned to find themselves at the center of a grab for power and money. Mr. Zuma himself was charged with corruption before rising to the presidency in 2009 though the charges were dropped on largely technical grounds. He has

The findings based on an insomnia treatment that uses talk therapy rather than drugs are the first to emerge from a series of closely watched studies of sleep and depression to be released in the coming year.         The new report affirms the results of a smaller pilot study giving scientists confidence that the effects of the insomnia treatment are real. If the figures continue to hold up the advance will be the most significant in the treatment of depression since the introduction of Prozac in 1987.         Depression is the most common mental disorder affecting some 18 million Americans in any given year according to government figures and more than half of them also have insomnia.         Experts familiar with the new report said that the results were plausible and that if supported by other studies they should lead to major changes in treatment.         It would be an absolute boon to the field said Dr. Nada L. Stotland professor of psychiatry at Rush Medical College in Chicago who was not connected with the latest research.         It makes good common sense clinically she continued. If you have a depression youre often awake all night its extremely lonely its dark youre aware every moment that the world around you is sleeping every concern you have is magnified.         The study is the first of four on sleep and depression nearing completion all financed by the  The new report from a team at Ryerson University in Toronto found that 87 percent of patients who resolved their insomnia in four biweekly talk therapy sessions also saw their depression symptoms dissolve after eight weeks of treatment either with an antidepressant drug or a placebo pill  almost twice the rate of those who could not shake their insomnia. Those numbers are in line with a previous pilot study of insomnia treatment at Stanford.         In an interview the reports lead author  Dr. Carney acknowledged that the study was small  just 66 patients  and said a clearer picture should emerge as the other teams of scientists released their results. Those studies are being done at Stanford Duke and the University of Pittsburgh and include about 70 subjects each. Dr. Carney will present her data on Saturday at a convention of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies in Nashville.         Doctors have known for years that sleep problems are intertwined with mood disorders. But only recently have they begun to investigate the effects of treating both at the same time. Antidepressant drugs like Prozac help many people as does talk therapy but in rigorous studies the treatments administered individually only slightly outperform placebo pills. Used together the treatments produce a cure rate  full recovery  for about 40 percent of patients.         Adding insomnia therapy however to an antidepressant would sharply lift the cure rate Dr. Carneys data suggests as do the findings from the Stanford pilot study which included 30 people.         Doctors have long considered poor sleep to be a symptom of depression that would clear up with treatments said Rachel Manber a professor in the psychiatry and behavioral sciences department at Stanford whose 2008 pilot trial of insomnia therapy provided the rationale for larger studies. But we now know thats not the case she said. The relationship is bidirectional  that insomnia can precede the depression.         Full-blown insomnia is more serious than the sleep problems most people occasionally have. To qualify for a diagnosis people must have endured at least a month of chronic sleep loss that has caused problems at work at home or in important relationships. Several studies now suggest that developing insomnia doubles a persons risk of later becoming depressed  the sleep problem preceding the mood disorder rather than the other way around.

But Moffitt quit the same week that the N.F.L. was consumed by allegations of bullying on the Miami Dolphins and disturbing reports that the former Dallas Cowboys running back Tony Dorsett and other retired stars might have early onset degenerative brain disease.         The heightened awareness of footballs physical tolls has prompted hundreds of former players to express regret over what the sport did to their bodies.Â Yet Moffitt is unique for openly discussing his injuries and the brutal reality of playing in the N.F.L.Â          They are merchandising human beings lets be honest said MoffittÂ who at a cafe in Pike Place Market in Seattle reveled in his freedom much like the Tim Robbins character in The Shawshank Redemption who after breaking out of jail rips off his shirt in the rain and laughs at the sky.         In a far-reaching interview last week Moffitt described how his decision to leave the N.F.L. a level he worked so hard to reach was far from rash even though he announced it on Twitter and was accused online of being impulsive and naÃ¯ve.         Quitting he said had little to do with his diminished playing time though he suited up for only two games this season or any dissatisfaction with the Seahawks or Broncos organizations which he said treated him well.         Rather it was the culmination of months of reflection that his once-promising career had been derailed by injuries and that continuing to play for the money and to please others would very likely ruin his health further and deepen his gloom.         In the off-season after battling for playing time and trying to stay fit Moffitt a free spirit who idolizes Jim Morrison started reading the writings of the Dalai Lama and Noam Chomsky among others. They helped him conclude that he was a pawn in a machine that controlled his life and that he no longer wanted to meet the expectations attached to that life.         You kind of let go of that dream that you kill yourself for to be a millionaire and you see through it and see that its just a facade said Moffitt who was dressed in baggy jeans T-shirt work boots and black pea coat. I let go of all that stuff.         Moffitt returned to training camp harboring doubts. In August the Seahawks traded him to Cleveland but the deal was reversed because the Browns said they had concerns about his health. Moffitt said the Browns voided the trade because he refused to take a pay cut something the team denied.         So the Seahawks traded Moffitt to the Broncos for whom he had an opportunity to protect Peyton Manning probably the N.F.L.s biggest star. To outsiders it was a dream job with a near-certain trip to the playoffs. But the trade only confirmed to Moffitt that he did not control his destiny.         His love of the game changed because its a business in the N.F.L. his father Dave Moffitt said. The minute he signed I told him: Youre John Moffitt Inc. The rah-rah is great for the fans but you have to treat yourself as a business.        
37,100000002545716,1,Article,News,Magazine,magazine,,Switzerland’s Proposal to Pay People for Being Alive,ANNIE LOWREY,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/magazine/switzerlands-proposal-to-pay-people-for-being-alive.html,18,This fall a truck dumped eight million coins outside the Parliament building in Bern one for every Swiss citizen. It was a publicity stunt for advocates of an audacious social policy that just might become reality in the tiny rich country. Along with the coins activists delivered 125000 signatures  enough to trigger a Swiss public referendum this time on providing a monthly income to every citizen no strings attached. Every month every Swiss person would receive a check from the government no matter how rich or poor how hardworking or lazy how old or young. Poverty would disappear. Economists needless to say are sharply divided on what would reappear in its place  and whether such a basic-income scheme might have some appeal for other less socialist countries too.         The proposal is in part the brainchild of a German-born artist named Enno Schmidt a leader in the basic-income movement. He knows it sounds a bit crazy. He thought the same when someone first described the policy to him too. I tell people not to think about it for others but think about it for themselves Schmidt told me. What would you do if you had that income? What if you were taking care of a child or an elderly person? Schmidt said that the basic income would provide some dignity and security to the poor especially Europes underemployed and unemployed. It would also he said help unleash creativity and entrepreneurialism: Switzerlands workers would feel empowered to work the way they wanted to rather than the way they had to just to get by. He even went so far as to compare it to a civil rights movement like womens suffrage or ending slavery.         When we spoke Schmidt repeatedly described the policy as  Go to a cocktail party in Berlin and there is always someone spouting off about the benefits of a basic income just as you might hear someone talking up Robin Hood taxes in New York or single-payer health care in Washington. And its not only in vogue in wealthy Switzerland. Beleaguered and debt-wracked Cyprus is weighing the implementation of basic incomes too. They even are whispered about in the United States where certain wonks on the libertarian right and liberal left have come to a strange convergence around the idea  some prefer an unconditional basic income that would go out to everyone no strings attached; others a means-tested minimum income to supplement the earnings of the poor up to a given level.         The case from the right is one of expediency and efficacy. Lets say that Congress decided to provide a basic income through the tax code or by expanding the Social Security program. Such a system might work better and be fairer than the current patchwork of programs including welfare food stamps and housing vouchers. A single father with two jobs and two children would no longer have to worry about the hassle of visiting a bunch of offices to receive benefits. And giving him a single lump sum might help him use his federal dollars better. Housing vouchers have to be spent on housing food stamps on food. Those dollars would be more valuable  both to the recipient and the economy at large  if they were fungible.         Even better conservatives think such a program could significantly reduce the size of our federal bureaucracy. It could take the place of welfare food stamps housing vouchers and hundreds of other programs all at once: Hello basic income; goodbye H.U.D. Charles Murray of the conservative American Enterprise Institute has proposed a minimum income for just that reason  feed the poor and starve the beast. Give the money to the people Murray wrote in his book In Our Hands: A Plan to Replace the Welfare State. He suggested guaranteeing $10000 a year to anyone meeting the following conditions: be American be over 21 stay out of jail and  as he once quipped  have a pulse.

In the 1940s and 50s the South with its military tradition and its many Army bases was a stronghold of support for robust interventions in World War II and then the Cold War even as northern Democrats joined Midwestern Republicans in favoring a more cautious foreign policy. At the same time when the first modern civil rights legislation was passed -- in the 1950s and 60s -- Republicans in the North were as much opposed to Jim Crow policies as northern Democrats while the staunchest opposition came from Democrats in the Deep South.         Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Republicans began to make inroads into the Solid South and shifted the partys axis along the Sun Belt. The northern moderate Republicans of the previous decades either left the party or were replaced by conservatives. The Democratic Party also became more ideologically cohesive. In subsequent years this trend has continued with the result that bipartisanship has become increasingly rare.

Among the thousands who attended Sundays informal tribute at the site where Paul Walker a star of the multibillion-dollar Fast and Furious movie franchise died in a crash With Mr. Rodas at the wheel of the Porsche the two men who were also business partners had set out from their nearby Always Evolving racing shop in Rye Canyon Business Park. The crash occurred near the sharp corner onto Hercules Street the Porsche smashing into a pole and several small oak trees before bursting into flames.         On Sunday afternoon Mr. Enrique had joined other fans as part of what the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department termed an unsanctioned event. The 20-year-old student from Camarillo Calif. said he had always enjoyed the family feel of the six street-racing movies.         Everybody comes together he said explaining that he regularly shows his 2004 Ford Mustang GT at cruise nights in Oxnard Calif. You become a car fanatic.          One Inland Empire group had posted its plan to leave San Bernardino at 9 a.m. sharp and cover the 90-mile journey well before 11:00 a.m. An Audi club from San Diego dispatched a convoy of 25 cars that included a souped-up Chevrolet Cobalt for the 150-mile trip.         About 100 Harley-Davidsons from the Vietnam Vets/Legacy Vets motorcycle club Chapter L had convened a few miles away in Sylmar after traveling independently from all directions in honor of their fellow member Paul Walker Sr. the stars father the clubs past president Manuel Escobedo said. The bikers departed the memorial at around 2:30 p.m. hoping to stay warmer on the 55-degree afternoon than they had on their morning ride.         For others it had been a much longer trip. A 15-car procession traveled the 425 miles from Gilbert Ariz. while other cars license plates showed that people had traveled from as far away as Oregon Utah and New Mexico. Several groups came from Las Vegas and one lone-eagle Mercedes-Benz had carried its occupants on a two-day 1700-mile jaunt from Minot N.D.         A little road trip the driver said before moving along in the procession past the crash site.         There the commotion was just short of intense. A sheriffs helicopter buzzed overhead and twin banner-towing airplanes circled in formation with a longish message: R.I.P. God be with Fast & Furious star Paul Walker¦ Our hearts go out to his friends and family. It was signed: Paris Hilton.         Meanwhile the parade of cars proceeding up Kelly Johnson Parkway and onto Hercules Street ranged from bland  as with a completely stock Toyota Corolla  to flamboyant  namely a Cadillac Escalade EXT rolling on 32-inch rims. A host of right-hand-drive cars from Japan gave street-racing enthusiasts a dose of Japanese Domestic Market or J.D.M. authenticity. Every sort of ground-scraping Honda and Nissan imaginable showed up and dozens of sport bikes rolled by the riders often revving their engines in a deafening salute.         Many of those who walked the half-mile after parking at Walmart or Home Depot laid bouquets and candles on the curb although some left car parts and bottles of beer.         One person standing nearby Nancy NollÃ© said she had been at home in Knokke-Heist Belgium when she learned of the deaths on Facebook.         Is that real? she remembered thinking. She had already planned a trip to California to visit a friend so they decided to visit Santa Clarita together. Ms. NollÃ© said she didnt find the display of emotion there surprising. In Europe the grieving is smaller.         Paul Walker is credited with saying If one day the speed kills me do not cry because I was smiling. This became an epitaph of sorts plastered everywhere duplicated on hoodies in die-cut vinyl lettering applied to car bodies and even on the back of a racing helmet where it had been handwritten before being placed near one of the charred oaks at the crash site.         Although the sheriffs department investigation into the accident is not complete many people at the memorial procession had their own theories of how it happened. It was common to blame the of the cars handling but Ryan Jones of nearby Saugus who said he used to be a big racer had visited the scene soon after the accident and said he saw power-steering fluid on the pavement.         Whatever the cause it would seem that after Sunday the Rye Canyon Business Park is likely to join the spot on what is now California Route 46 where James Dean crashed his Porsche in 1955 as a hallowed location.         Race in paradise Jasmin Alvarez wrote on a memorial banner.

People with back problems and people who dont have back problems yet.         Are you the kind of person who will develop back problems? Take this easy test.         l. Are you alive?         2. Are you getting older?         3. Do you ever pick things up?         If you answered yes to any of these questions back problems are probably in your future. ( But Im not the kind of person who has back problems! you protest.         Thats what everyone says. Right up until the moment his or her back goes out.         What did mine in was decades of library work. Hours spent lifting small weights (books). And heavier weights (reference books). Not to mention carrying carton after carton of donated books from the vestibule where patrons dropped them off into the storage room. All of which I handled with the casual assumption that I was and would always be Superwoman.         I thought nothing of stooping hoisting up a mammoth box of books then lugging it the length of the library.         People tried to warn me. Watch your back! a patron would caution as I staggered by with a large box.         Thanks! I would respond while thinking: Back problems? Me? Not a chance.         Then one morning I got out of bed and I couldnt stand up. My back refused to bear my weight. I hit the floor then crawled back into bed and phoned my sister who has coped with back problems for years.         Ill be right there with a heating pad she said. First you need to heat it. Then you need to ice it. And then you need Michele.         Michele is her (and now my) physical therapist.         After working with Michele and dutifully doing my exercises each morning Ive gotten to the point where I can function again.         But Ill never be the same. I can no longer sit for any length of time before the pain starts creeping in. Or lift anything heavier than a Yorkiepoo. Which is say five pounds. Thats two library books. (Unless youre talking about the first volume of Mark Twains autobiography which at close to 800 pages is closer to a Bichon.)         As my co-workers zip around with big stacks of books Ive learned to limit myself to two one in each hand.         Or else I use a book cart which is what I should have done in the first place. (My boss used to pester me to use a book cart. Naturally I ignored her. You hate to think that your boss could be right about anything.)         I know what youre thinking: Theres nothing wrong with MY back!         Nonsense. Youre just one sports injury crazy dance move or well-intentioned offer to help a pal carry that armoire up to the attic from Broke-Back Boomer.         When your back does inevitably go out heres my advice: Do your exercises. Never lift heavy objects. And most important channel Nancy Reagan: Learn to  I used to be the first one to pitch in to get the job done.         Help move your ex-boyfriends marimba out to the curb? Id love to. Hold those six bags of groceries for a moment while you get the front door open? No problem. Hoist Voldemort your labradoodle into the mud room sink for a paw wash after he comes in from a backyard romp? Easily done!         But now if it needs to be picked up lifted carried or moved Im no longer  And dont even think of asking me to go with you to Ikea.         My man just became a grandpa for the first time. He can hold baby Brock for hours. I can hold him for at most 10 minutes.         By the time my son places my own first grandchild in my arms I want to be able to hold him. Easily. For a good long time.         So Ill continue to do back-strengthening exercises. And to refrain however much I want to from helping you lift that fallen tree limb off your Toyota. Not only that but for the sake of my back Ive done two things I thought I would never do.         Practice yoga. And acquire wheeled luggage.         I always thought people with rolling suitcases looked rather silly like grown-up toddlers with a pull-toy. Now Im the proud owner of a sky blue Samsonite Lift Easy with multidirectional spinner wheels. And while Im way too impatient by nature to actually want to slow down breathe deeply and assume the Upside Down Turtle or Backward Facing Squirrel youll find me on the mat every Monday and Wednesday for Gentle Yoga With Georgette.         Should I have accepted these changes more gracefully? You bet. After all Im pushing 60. Nobody expected my Grandmother to hoist  But Im a boomer. Forever young. And a feminist. (I am Woman! Hear me Roar! Then watch me lift this heavy box!)         Even so the strength I really need now is the strength to cope with my own limitations. To ask for help when I need it. (And to refrain from hollering Watch your back you idiot! every time I see you go by carrying anything heavier than a Yorkiepoo.)

The war between mockingbirds and cowbirds is a case in point.         Cowbirds are brood parasites meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species thus unloading the messy and demanding business of chick-rearing. They also peck holes in the eggs of the host birds destroying as many as they can.         Mockingbirds are a favorite target of this plan and it seems to make perfect sense for them to viciously attack cowbirds when they catch them in the nest.         But when Ros Gloag then a doctoral student at Oxford and her colleagues in Argentina looked closely at the war between chalk-browed mockingbirds and shiny cowbirds they found something unexpected as they  They stationed small video cameras near the nests of 40 pairs of chalk-browed mockingbirds. Over two breeding seasons they recorded more than 200 attacks on intruding cowbirds.         They were surprised to find that these attacks which their videos show to be quite vicious did not stop the cowbirds from laying eggs. The cowbirds would hunker down and let the much large mockingbirds deliver hammer blows to the head but in matter of seconds they would lay an egg and flee.         How could such a failed strategy persist in evolution?         The answer according to Dr. Gloag now a postdoctoral researcher at Australian National University was that the attacks did prevent the cowbirds from carrying out the second prong of their plan destroying the mockingbird eggs already in the nest.         So the mockingbirds managed to save some of their offspring. They still end up raising unwanted baby cowbird guests. But said Dr. Gloag once the eggs hatch the larger mockingbird chicks compete very well with the smaller cowbirds.

Though researchers do not name the hackers targets in the report The New York Times identified the foreign ministries through email addresses listed on the attackers web page. A person with knowledge of the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly confirmed that the foreign ministries of the five countries had been breached.         Even as revelations by Edward J. Snowden about surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency and its intelligence partners dominate attention the FireEye report is a reminder that Chinese hackers continue to break into the computer systems of governments and firms using simple email-based attacks.         The FireEye report does not link the attacks to a specific group in  Unlike other groups which tend to attack commercial targets this campaign specifically targeted ministries of foreign affairs said Nart Villeneuve the researcher who helped lead FireEyes efforts.         Last year Mr. Villeneuve then a researcher at Trend Micro a security company in Tokyo traced a series of attacks on firms in Japan and India as well as Tibetan activists to a former graduate student at Sichuan University who had joined Tencent Chinas leading Internet company.         Mr. Villeneuve said the current hacks were highly selective. Researchers first began tracking the campaign  which they call Ke3Chang after a reference buried in the malware code  in 2011. That October various Group of 20 finance ministers were targeted during a summit meeting in Paris.         The attackers sent their targets emails with a link that claimed to contain naked photos of Carla Bruni-Sarkozy wife of former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France. Once clicked attackers were able to gain a foothold into their targets computer networks though investigators said they were unable to see which files the attackers had taken. The closest they came was last August when FireEyes researchers were able to infiltrate one of the groups 23 command-and-control servers for one week. They could see that the server had breached 21 different targets including government ministries in the five European countries.         They watched as attackers mapped out victims computer networks searching for users with privileged access who would allow them entry into the computers of high value targets.         That glimpse gave researchers a rare window into the attackers techniques and clues to their origin. Their malware contained Chinese character strings and one Web page used to compromise computers was written in Chinese. They also used several machines to test their malware which used the Chinese language as the default setting.         Beyond the fact they are Chinese we dont know who the attackers are or what their motivations might be Mr. Villeneuve said.         Chinas Foreign Ministry officials have said China does not sanction hacking and is itself a victim of hacking attacks. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not return a request for comment on Monday.         Security experts say foreign ministries have long been a target for Chinese hackers. James A. Lewis a former State Department official and senior fellow and director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said past hacking attacks on the foreign ministries of Australia Britain Germany France India and Canada had all been traced to the Chinese government.         The Chinese are eager to look at foreign ministries to glean trade information and because they can read what foreign diplomats are saying about the Americans or Japanese he said.         Rob Rachwald FireEyes senior director of research said the company had witnessed other campaigns in which attackers had broken into foreign ministries and think tanks to steal early drafts of policy papers specifically related to China.         Mr. Rachwald said FireEye had notified the latest victims but that in many cases they only deployed bare basic computer security defenses in response.         David Frous a deputy spokesman for the Czech Republics Ministry said the ministry could not comment. However I can assure you every precaution to prevent hacking on our computer systems is being made he said.         Karlis Eihenbaums a spokesman for the Latvian Foreign Ministry said the ministry had no comment. Spokesmen for the Portuguese Hungarian and Bulgarian foreign ministries did not respond to requests for comment.         FireEyes researchers have traced three different variants of malware back to Ke3Chang. From there they were able to see that the same attackers had also targeted organizations in the aerospace energy high-tech consulting chemical manufacturing and mining sectors.         Most recently the attackers have tried to bait targets into clicking on a link in an email purporting to contain information about possible American military intervention in Syria. Researchers say the emails predated the most recent G-20 meeting in Russia last September.         Using current events to bait targets is nothing new. In March 2012 researchers say the same group used an email about the London Olympics. Three months later the same group repurposed a security report from McAfee the antivirus software pioneer and loaded it with malicious code so that as soon as a target clicked on the attachment attackers gained a foothold into their machines.         FireEye said the Ke3Chang attackers have taken great pains to mask their activities by frequently switching out their hacking tools. And though researchers have only identified 23 of the attackers command-and-control servers they mapped Web addresses back to a total of 99 servers  all of them based in China Hong Kong and the United States  and believe the number of compromised computers is much larger than what they can see.         It is so easy to hack foreign targets intelligence agencies cant resist said Mr. Lewis.        
47,100000002594187,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,baseball,"Outfield Full, Yanks Seek Pitching and Infield Help",DAVID WALDSTEIN,766,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/sports/baseball/outfield-full-yanks-seek-pitching-and-infield-help.html,14,LAKE BUENA VISTA Fla.  With an off-season spending binge behind him Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman arrived at baseballs winter meetings Monday afternoon having many lesser roster issues still unresolved.         Most of the teams offensive needs have been addressed but there are still positional holes to fill. The Yankees may add a second baseman or third baseman a starting pitcher and a couple of relievers but according to a person in baseball who has spoken to Cashman the first order of business at the Swan and Dolphin hotel this week is to see what trade possibilities exist.         The Yankees could return to free agency if they do not find something appealing in trade talks with other teams.         With the signings of Jacoby Ellsbury and Carlos Beltran the Yankees have a glut of outfielders. The most tradable is Brett Gardner and several teams have called the Yankees asking if he is available. The Yankees like Gardner and could keep him to form a speedy lineup combination alongside Ellsbury. Originally the Yankees were leaning in that direction. But once they signed Beltran the situation changed somewhat and with so many teams showing interest the Yankees would be remiss not to entertain talks.         In the lobbies and hallways of the hotel here the names of pitchers like Jeff Samardzija of the Chicago Cubs and Chris Sale of the White Sox are on the lips of many executives scouts and agents. Several wondered about the likelihood of a trade involving Sale and noted that Samardzija who is arbitration eligible would have higher trade value because he is relatively affordable (at a salary of $2.64 million last season).         Gardner will be a free agent after the 2014 season and that makes him less desirable to any team looking to retain an inexpensive player for several years. He could be used to acquire a second baseman.         If nothing materializes via trade the Yankees could continue their pursuit of the free-agent infielder Omar Infante. But the Yankees were hearing that Infante 31 was asking for a four-year deal and they are not inclined to do that. They also have shown interest in Mark Reynolds who demonstrated his versatility for the Yankees last season at both third base and first base.         The Yankees acted swiftly after they lost Robinson Cano to the Seattle Mariners signing Beltran the same day. They signed Ellsbury earlier in the week after sensing that Cano would leave. Ellsbury agreed to a seven-year $153 million contract to play center field for the Yankees and left the Boston Red Sox searching for a new leadoff hitter.         He played with a broken foot he played with a beat-up left thumb Red Sox Manager John Farrell said and I think he proved to a lot of people including himself that hes very capable and certainly a dynamic player.         Farrell added: Were going to miss Jacoby. Hes a very good player.         The Yankees lost an exceptional player in Cano but Jarrod Saltalamacchia the catcher who left the Red Sox to sign with the Miami Marlins said the Yankees could be in better shape as they have been reconstituted.         He was the guy you said Were not going to let him beat usÂ  Saltalamacchia said of Cano. Hes a great player and you cant really just throw him soft stuff because he can handle that. But they got Ellsbury and Brian McCann and Beltran and its better to have three or four of those guys than just one.         The Yankee also re-signed Hiroki Kuroda but they still need another starter. They have shown little if any interest so far in the big-name free-agent pitchers on the market. But they are still closely monitoring the situation with Masahiro Tanaka the Japanese ace.         According to a person who has been involved with the discussions over the new posting system for Japanese players an agreement is expected to be reached within days perhaps allowing Tanaka the hard-throwing right-hander to be posted. But the Rakuten Eagles Tanakas team are disappointed that the new system includes a maximum posting bid of $20 million which guarantees only the right to negotiate with the player. Because of their dismay the Eagles have hinted that they might not post Tanaka.         Yozo Tachibana the president of the Eagles was expected to arrive at the meetings Tuesday to discuss the matter. If Tanaka is posted the Yankees are expected to submit a maximum bid and then try to sign him to a contract. But many teams are expected to make maximum bids and Tanaka will be allowed to negotiate with all of them.

Such a delay broached by Ahmet Uzumcu the director general of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons would be the first in the timetable of the eradication program which began more than two months ago and is considered so far to be an extraordinary and conspicuous success in a country at war.

But the roads traverse rebel-controlled areas.         In view of the circumstances in this country it will be quite difficult to meet this timeline Mr. Uzumcu was quoted by news services as saying at a news conference in Oslo. He was in Norway to accept the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of his organization at a ceremony on Tuesday.

He denounced the decision to remove him suggesting it was politically motivated. Earlier he  Mr. Petro can appeal the ruling.         The mayor of BogotÃ¡ Colombias capital and a city with a population of about eight million people is one of the countrys most high-profile elected officials. Some recent mayors have become famous worldwide lauded for innovative work in reviving what had been a deteriorating city.         But the mayor elected before Mr. Petro was jailed for corruption and Mr. Petros tenure has been rocky.         He took office with high expectations in 2012. A former member of the M-19 rebel group now disbanded he was seen as a leftist politician with a bright political future. But once in office he was criticized for his management style viewed by some as an idealist with little interest in or aptitude for the daily work of running a complex and chaotic city.         He was widely criticized last December when trash piled up in the streets after the transfer of garbage collection to a government-run service went badly.         The inspector general Alejandro OrdÃ³Ã±ez said that among the reasons for the decision to remove the mayor Mr. Petro had put public health at risk by mismanaging the transfer. He also said the mayor acted against the interests of fair competition by arranging it so that private companies could not provide garbage service.         Mr. Petro was jailed for his guerrilla activities in the 1980s but he eventually embraced electoral politics and was elected to the Senate where he was known for his vocal criticism of corruption and legislators with ties to right-wing paramilitary groups. He made a run for president in 2010.

He was more serious discussing in vague terms what he might do next. He had already accomplished a good deal adding the free-agent outfielders Chris Young and Curtis Granderson at a likely cost of $23 million on the 2014 payroll. His No. 1 need seems to be finding a veteran starting pitcher who is not very expensive and could help fill out a rotation that has Zack Wheeler Dillon Gee and Jon Niese but will be without Matt Harvey until 2015.         Alderson said he would be hesitant to give a free-agent starting pitcher a multiyear deal only because he expected his two top pitching prospects Noah Syndergaard and Rafael Montero to be ready to join the major league rotation sooner rather than later. He said he would prefer not to bring either up until midseason following the formula he followed with Harvey in 2012 and Wheeler in 2013 but indicated he might not have the luxury to be that patient.         Ideally wed like to ease guys in Alderson said. But these may not be ideal times.         Another option for the rotation is Jenrry Mejia who Alderson said will compete for a spot in spring training. Mejia has been an elusive prospect for the Mets because of a series of arm injuries one of which required Tommy John elbow surgery.         Indeed Alderson said he wondered if Mejia could stay healthy for a sustained period. Last season Mejia joined the rotation in the second half and pitched effectively in five starts with a 2.70 earned run average but then was shut down to have surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow. He is still only 24.         In addition Alderson has met with a representative for Bartolo Colon who is 16 years older than Mejia. But Colon almost defying logic went 18-6 for Oakland in 2013 with a 2.65 E.R.A. in 30 starts. He may be looking for more money than the Mets want to pay him.         Another potential candidate Bronson Arroyo has proved to be remarkably durable for Cincinnati during the past eight seasons. But at 36 he is seeking a multiyear deal perhaps worth close to $10 million a year which is also probably too rich for the Mets even if they did just give Granderson $60 million over four years.         It might make the most sense for Alderson to take a flier on a pitcher such as Daisuke Matsuzaka or Johan Santana. Matsuzaka allowed just four runs in his final four starts for the Mets last season after being acquired almost as an afterthought. However Alderson said there have been no discussions aimed at bringing back Matsuzaka. Santana battered by injuries has not pitched in two of the past three seasons and is finally off the Mets payroll. But would Alderson bring him back at an extremely reduced rate?         Wait and see Alderson said. Until that time theres that episode of Homeland he would like to take a peek at.

Cars backed up the town turned into a parking lot half-hour bridge commutes stretched into four hours buses and children were late for school and emergency workers could not respond quickly to the days events which included a missing toddler a cardiac arrest and a car driving into a building.         But the George Washington Bridge is the worlds busiest and New Jersey is led by one of the nations most pugnacious and prominent politicians Gov.  So the unfolding story of the lane closings has become something of a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre resulting in a hearing before the New Jersey Legislature on Monday as well as a window into the proudly aggressive and often secretive dealings of Mr. Christies team.         The mayor of Fort Lee a Democrat complained in a letter in September that the lane closings were punitive  Mr. Christie a Republican was leaning heavily on Democratic mayors to endorse him for re-election so he could present himself as a presidential candidate with bipartisan appeal but the mayor was not going along.         Mr. Christie  But on Friday the man who ordered the closings  a high school friend of the governors who was a small-town mayor and the founder of an anonymous political blog before Mr. Christies appointee created a job for him at the Port Authority   And testifying under subpoena in Trenton on Monday bridge workers described Mr. Christies associates ordering the closings and called the different maneuvers unprecedented odd and wrong. There was they said no study.         Mr. Christies associates at the Port Authority they said ordered bridge workers to shut down the lanes with three days notice despite warnings that it would cause havoc and that changes of this magnitude typically took years of planning. They were instructed not to tell anyone  not the news media not Fort Lee not even the Port Authoritys executive director who is an appointee of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York they said. They protested but went along they said because they feared retribution.         At perhaps the strangest turn in the legislative hearing the chairman of the Transportation Committee Assemblyman John Wisniewski a Democrat pressed the Port Authoritys executive director Patrick J. Foye to say whether it was possible that the police officer who had overseen the moving of the cones that closed the lanes  a man named Captain Licorice though no one who testified could verify the spelling of his name  had been given a promotion as a reward for staying silent about the whole operation.         You have to forgive our suspicion here Mr. Wisniewski told Mr. Foye who was forced as other Port Authority officials were to attend the hearing by subpoena. Theres a lot here thats happened that is not normal that is unprecedented.         It is troubling to me too Mr. Foye replied. (He did say however that the promotion was not an exchange for silence.)         The bridge mess began on Sept. 6 when David Wildstein Mr. Christies old friend who had been installed in a job at the Port Authority called the man in charge of the bridge and his supervisor and ordered them to close two of the three lanes that lead from local streets in Fort Lee into a toll plaza on the upper level of the bridge.         Mr. Wildstein who long wrote posts on the blog  About 70000 cars from all over northern New Jersey travel along the three access lanes each day and on the first day of what would be four days of the shutdown cars stalled the streets of Fort Lee. Cedric Fulton the director of tunnels and bridges at the Port Authority testified on Monday that he had repeatedly told Mr. Wildstein that it would cause a traffic disaster. My exact words were This will not end wellÂ  he said.         When Mr. Fulton asked Mr. Wildstein whether he had informed Fort Lee officials and its police or Mr. Foye or the media Mr. Wildstein replied he testified: Dont worry about that. We will take care of it.         Mr. Wildstein told the bridge workers that the study was to determine how traffic would be affected if local lanes were shut down.         But the workers testified that the Port Authority already collected data on how many cars traveled in each lane so such a traffic study would have been unnecessary.         The director of the bridge Robert Durando testified that in 35 years at the Port Authority he had never heard of lanes being closed down for a traffic study.         Mr. Foye learned about the lanes closings only after they had been blocked for four days when a traffic columnist for The Record called the Port Authoritys media office to inquire.         Mr. Baroni Mr. Foye said instructed Port Authority workers There is to be no public comment at this time.         Mr. Foye told legislators he would have fired Mr. Wildstein but that as the New York appointee he did not have authority over the New Jersey appointees staff.         Assemblyman Wisniewski pressed Mr. Durando the bridge director to explain why he had not sought to reverse Mr. Wildsteins order even after residents and local police officials described the operation as a monumental failure. Mr. Durando said he did not want to violate the chain of command.         Your testimony tells me that there is a culture of fear at the Port Authority Mr. Wisniewski said. Is there a culture of fear?         Mr. Durando sat silently.         I think your answer speaks for itself Mr. Wisniewski said finally.

KRAMER,680,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/world/europe/ukrainian-protesters-struggle-to-keep-police-and-cold-at-bay.html,,KIEV Ukraine  Aleksandr Kvashenko looked up from making sandwiches in his tent encampment to realize that he had suddenly been encircled by hundreds of riot police officers. The camps usual contingent of burly men had sallied out to a nearby street as security forces began confronting protesters.         Well they wont arrest me because Im just the cook Mr. Kvashenko said though he sounded doubtful. The police had brought a backhoe that could easily have pried apart the tiny corral-like enclosure of wooden barricades. The episode was just one example of the seesaw struggle for control of important intersections and entrances to government buildings that was underway Monday evening in Kiev.         Protesters used the momentum of a large rally on Sunday to spread out from the central plaza that has been their base for antigovernment protests that are entering their third week. With security forces all but absent from the streets a crowd  Those camps were the ones surrounded and in some cases overrun as thousands of riot police officers descended. Thousands of protesters were also on the streets but they could not be everywhere.         On a day when the initiative on the street seemed to shift from protesters to the police the interaction between the two groups never went beyond shoving matches. The police were at times courteous offering protesters their arms to walk on icy sidewalks. Yet the potential for violence always felt near.         Western leaders again called President Viktor F. Yanukovich on Monday to warn against using force to disperse the demonstrators.         The tiny outpost on the corner of Shovkovichna and Bogomoltsa Streets where Mr. Kvashenko was cooking went up Sunday evening. Unlike most sites it had a perimeter fence made from fresh lumber rather than debris. UDAR the political party of the champion boxer  Mr. Klitschko sat on a plastic chair by a fire burning in a drum for much of the evening before rushing out to confront the police bringing in the backhoe and to negotiate with a police commander. The upshot was that the backhoe drove away and Mr. Klitschkos companions came back to the camp.         Earlier Mr. Klitschko the hood of his parka rimmed with frost from the snowstorm sweeping the streets carried plastic cups filled with steaming chicken soup to the riot police who had surrounded his camp.         When he returned he removed a glove and held his hand over a fire clenching and unclenching to warm it.         Mr. Klitschko said the small camps became necessary because the government had not reacted to the weeks of protests in the central square. We want the president to hear our demands he said. We want to free the innocent people in jail and punish those responsible for beating students and we want the government to take responsibility for our failing political and economic conditions and resign.         Another tactic here was to smother the police with something like love as expressed during the snowstorm. We hug them we bring them tea we wipe off their helmets said Valentina Zagurskaya a pensioner describing the way she interacted with the line of heavily armored young men outside the camp.         Through the evening Mr. Kvashenko made soup in a gigantic kettle propped over a bonfire sandwiches and endless cups of coffee and tea.         As the men filed back in from the face-off with the police Mr. Kvashenko retrieved from a tent larder a half-gallon canning jar of raw bacon pried off the lid with a knife and sliced the meat into squares. It was served on plastic plates. Fat is energy and energy is what we need he said.         One man returned shivering stomping his feet and clapping his hands. What do you want black coffee coffee with milk or tea? Mr. Kvashenko asked.         I really dont care at all his customer said. Just give me something warm because Im freezing.        
54,100000002575126,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Newtown Massacre Prompts More Vigilance in Schools and Elsewhere,CHERYL P. WEINSTOCK,1080,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/nyregion/sandy-hook-massacre-prompts-heightened-vigilance-inside-schools-and-elsewhere.html,23,FAIRFIELD Conn.  Every morning Sgt. Edward Weihe walks into his office here and sifts through the police blotter to see what calls came in overnight. An interesting shift for a towns police department can look blasÃ© when reduced to paper forms: suspicious people outside buildings vandalism juvenile arrests.         But one recent morning Sergeant Weihe noticed a report that a year ago might not have been worth a second glance. A man was arrested in a domestic incident and the couple had a child who was a student at one of the towns elementary schools. So he called the school to make them aware that they could get drawn into a potentially violent family dispute.         Sergeant Weihe the supervisor of the Fairfield police school safety unit said that without his call to the school most likely they would not have had the information. He added This unit is a new evolutionary process at work.         Many towns in Connecticut and beyond began taking a closer look at their own security after the  As in other cities and towns there have been notable changes in security in Fairfield schools. They have new security cameras at many doors every door leading from the exterior of school buildings is locked at all times three armed officers float between school buildings and every classroom has access to 911.         A new anonymous tip line inside schools is yielding 15 calls a month on average for not only suspicious behavior but also everyday concerns like drug use and bullying.         Outside the schools Lt. James Perez has been giving a two-hour active shooter course that he has already taught to over 800 Town of Fairfield and private employees.         In addition to showing people how to react during a violent encounter which includes using improvised weapons such as a stapler Lieutenant Perez tells how to keep a gunman at bay by locking doors and avoiding the area of gunfire by leaning up against the wall on either side of the door. He also teaches how to pay closer attention to body language cues that he calls pivotal in picking up signs of a potentially violent person.         If someone is lying to you they tend to look away and not at you when you ask a direct question Lieutenant Perez told one class in November. They also appear preoccupied.         Other violent indicators he said include having unreasonable expectations not listening to what is being said not taking no for an answer acting out in anger and sending violent notes. Even a persons posture can be indicative of potential violence. Before he takes out his weapon the lieutenant said a gunman generally points his toes at his intended target.         If it all seems counter to the Yankee ideals of trusting ones neighbor and assuming the best Jenny Gillis a member of the Citizens Emergency Response Team Program which prepares civilians to assist the authorities during an emergency said it was a necessary adjustment.         I grew up in Connecticut said Ms. Gillis who works as a preschool teacher. Theres a self-containment and you mind your own business which is counterintuitive to being fully aware of your surroundings and noticing all strangers in your view like Lieutenant Perez taught me. Im polite. We give people space.         This is contrary to our upbringing and what we tell our children to do but we have to do this.          Sergeant Weihe whose office is inside the Fairfield school district headquarters is the quarterback of the school safety effort. Last month he spotted on the blotter a 911 call from a man who provided disturbing details of his intent to harm students at a Fairfield elementary school. The police took him to a hospital for evaluation; he was later arrested on charges of making threats.         That morning Sergeant Weihe sent fliers with the mans picture to all schools in town and worked with administrators on a plan to prevent him from entering any campus in the future.         The domestic incident he noticed one recent morning did not lead to any violence at school. But Sergeant Weihes call to the school had the added benefit of alerting teachers that the couples child might be having a bad day. When the student had an outburst in the classroom later that day the sergeant said instead of being punitive school officials were more understanding because of the stressors going on at home.         She was not a child who stepped out of line and needed to be punished he continued.         Many people in Fairfield are appreciative of the new efforts. But Norman Pattis a criminal defense and civil rights lawyer in nearby Bethany said that officials run a risk of taking cautiousness to an extreme.         Every time active school violence makes national news I get one or two phone calls from someone in a routine fist fight at school and administrators threw the book at him he said. If were going to transform every crackpots complaint into a Code Red that really gives state actors the ability to surveil us in a way thats unheralded in American life.         Michael Rose a Hartford lawyer who specializes in government employee issues saw only an upside to the new measures. If I see someone in the workplace presenting a threat I have to act he said. Personally I would rather have clients err on the side of safety and well deal with litigation later.         Despite all the new precautions the Rev. Alida Ward of  As a pastor we are always calling for people to be attuned to one another and to look out for one another with compassion and concern and so that task remains the same she said.         It may be we are more attuned to one another than we were way before and thats not all bad.        
55,100000002593422,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Buses and Trains Are Foundation of Plan to Get Ticket Holders to the Super Bowl,NATE SCHWEBER,734,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/nyregion/buses-and-trains-are-foundation-of-plan-to-get-ticket-holders-to-the-super-bowl.html,24,SECAUCUS N.J.  Next years Super Bowl will be the first to be played in an uncovered stadium in a cold-weather region. Organizers who hope it will be the Super Bowl of mass transit announced plans on Monday that they said would use buses and rails to move more people to and from the game than for any Super Bowl before.         At a news conference inside the Frank R. Lautenberg Station at Secaucus Junction coordinators for Super Bowl XLVIII and transportation officials made it clear that driving to the nearby MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford should be the least desirable option on the day of the game Feb. 2 because parking will be very limited and tight security will make traveling around the stadium difficult. In addition they said if the weather is inclement driving conditions could be hazardous.         People should put the getting around in the hands of professionals said Alfred F. Kelly Jr. the president and chief executive of the  And those who do secure a parking pass will not be allowed to engage in a tradition that many football fans consider sacred during the regular season: tailgating. Barbecue grills and lounge chairs will be forbidden and all food and drink must be consumed within the space of a single parking spot a rule that has been in place at the Super Bowl since 2002 officials said.         About 400000 visitors are expected to descend on the New York region in the week before the Super Bowl and about 80000 will attend the game itself officials said.         New York City subways New Jersey Transit and PATH trains will have about the same level of service as during weekday rush periods. For the game the host committee will operate a bus fleet called the Fan Express to carry people to and from five sites in Manhattan and four in New Jersey. The buses will cost $51 round trip and one lane of the Lincoln Tunnel will be dedicated to them.         The bus piece is different and new Mr. Kelly said. Its like the Olympics model.         Public transit is especially crucial to this years Super Bowl because only about 13000 parking spaces will be available at MetLife Stadium. The rest of the more than 28000 spaces there will be taken up by trucks used to televise the game and to provide entertainment.         In addition to the buses New Jersey Transit trains will be operating with game-day service from Secaucus Station to the stadium. New Jersey Transit also will sell a $50 unlimited-ride ticket called a Super Pass valid Jan. 27 to Feb. 3.         If theres any region that knows how to deal with public transportation issues said Jonathan Tisch an owner of the New York Giants and one of the chairmen of the host committee its this region.         For regular season football games about 10000 to 12000 spectators travel to the stadium by train and a smaller number by bus officials said. Other arrive in 30000 vehicles that park at the stadium and off-site lots.         Parking passes for Jets and Giants games at MetLife Stadium are $25 to $35 but Brian McCarthy a spokesman for the National Football League said the limited number of spaces for the Super Bowl will each cost $150. They will go on sale Thursday.         Ticket holders who might plan to hire a private car service might have to rethink those plans: for the first time Super Bowl officials will not allow passenger drop-off zones at the stadium.         No vehicle without a parking pass will be allowed into the security perimeter around the stadium organizers said. Nor will pedestrians even those walking from home Mr. Kelly said.         James Simpson the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Transportation said road crews would have plows ready in case of a snowstorm.         We have the trucks management and manpower on hand to fight any kind of weather Mr. Simpson said. Our goal is to keep vehicles on the move.         Robert Wood Johnson IV another chairman of the host committee said transportation was one of the biggest issues on his mind when he helped make the Super Bowl bid to the N.F.L.         Mr. Johnson who owns the Jets said Ive been to enough Super Bowls to know were not going to have any problem.        
56,100000002594162,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,football,Jets Need Consistency and Help to Move On,BEN SHPIGEL,736,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/sports/football/jets-need-consistency-and-help-to-move-on.html,15,FLORHAM PARK N.J.  It is Week 15 for the Jets which means that they are 6-7 coming off a victory and preparing to head south for a game that will boost  or destroy  their faint playoff hopes.         Faced with these circumstances last year they embarrassed themselves at Tennessee. Faced with these circumstances this year just how will the Jets react Sunday afternoon at Carolina?         There are hunches no doubt but little about this season makes sense. Their 37-27 victory against Oakland was as disorienting as it was encouraging the football equivalent of the dweeb kissing the prom queen.         The Jets offense which barely functioned during their three-game losing streak accounted for three touchdowns and six scoring drives. Their rushing defense a strength since September gave up a season-high 150 yards including a 63-yard touchdown to the fourth-string back Marcel Reece.         Its embarrassing Coach Rex Ryan said. It almost rips your heart out if you give up a run of that distance.         Over the last two weeks the Jets have allowed 275 rushing yards a development that Ryan dismissed as an anomaly and not evidence of a dispiriting trend. As a result of Sundays showing they are no longer the leagues best team against the run. They fell to No. 2 behind Carolina.         Most definitely well get that corrected defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson said.         Given their success there is justifiable reason for optimism. It is much harder to discern whether their offensive performance  and by extension the competence demonstrated by Geno Smith  heralded proficiency still to come or just a brief hiatus from the malaise. The returns of Santonio Holmes and Jeremy Kerley certainly helped; Ryan said it was hardly a coincidence that the Jets were 6-3 with Kerley their slot receiver who caught a touchdown pass Sunday in his first game since Nov. 3 and 0-4 without.         The offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg took advantage of Smiths mobility rolling him out and moving the pocket to try to confuse Oaklands defensive line. One such call came on the Jets first offensive play after Smiths lone interception when he ran a bootleg right and connected with Kellen Winslow on a 30-yard pass.         I just think it shows that he has confidence in me when we have a turnover like that and we come right back out and we pass it Smith said.         Ryan turned back the clock to last season with an oblique reference to Tim Tebow  Weve talked about it when we had somebody else  when explaining how Smiths elusiveness forces opponents to adjust their preparation time. Smith provides a more convincing case if only he ran as much as the Jets wished he would. He rushed five times for 50 yards Sunday including an 8-yard touchdown off a zone-read and a 32-yarder on a designed draw in the fourth quarter. At the end of the draw he took what Ryan called an unnecessary risk by lowering his right shoulder into Raiders safety Brandian Ross instead of turning out of bounds.         Its like Really kid?  Ryan said adding: Youre a quarterback in the National Football League. Its tough enough to stay healthy anyway let alone putting yourself at that kind of risk.         Already at great risk of missing the playoffs the Jets would be eliminated from contention with a loss Sunday and a Ravens victory in Detroit on Monday night. Any other combination of results extends their hopes another week keeping alive the possibility that even at 8-8 they could still sneak in. For that to happen they would need help as the one-game lead of Baltimore and Miami for the final wild-card spot is more like two because of their advantage in head-to-head tiebreakers.         It looked just as bleak at this time last season when the Jets faded and continued a different tradition one they established a year earlier: a three-game season-ending losing streak that produces major off-season changes.         Certainly I hope that doesnt happen again my gosh Ryan said. Im confident it wont.         EXTRA POINTS         Antonio Cromartie sustained a concussion Sunday and will be under the league protocol until he is cleared. Rex Ryan said Cromartie who played 66 of 69 snaps was not evaluated during the game but complained of a headache afterward. He certainly wasnt forced out there Ryan said. If anybody would have known about it or whatever there would have been some concerns.

Sundays defeat in San Diego only made it official a sloppy and fitting pratfall in a mess of a season that dawned with six successive losses.         Now the Giants have not qualified for the playoffs in four of the last five seasons and the downward spiral appears to be growing worse. Not since 2004  when  That year was also  It has left some players not knowing exactly how to feel. Wide receiver Victor Cruz one of the few Giants who has had a season to be proud of was asked Monday if the Giants would gain strength from upsetting the high-flying Seahawks.         It would put a smile on our faces and understand that this is something that we could have done all year Cruz answered.         But he continued It would kind of make it more disappointing because we didnt take advantage of playing like this all year long.         Losing complicates everything.         At times like these it is often said that coaches can use the final games to assess younger players and those who have not had much time on the field. The idea would be to evaluate the whole roster because some kind of overhaul would seem in order during the off-season.         Coughlin conceded that a couple of players who had been inactive might be given an opportunity in the next three weeks. But Coughlin is also old school. The 5-8 Giants can still avoid a losing season something Coughlin has had only five times in a 19-year career as an N.F.L. head coach.         The guys that deserve to play are going to play Coughlin said. Were going to try to win football games. Were not going to change any of our objectives or goals.         Asked to appraise the season and explain what went wrong Coughlin declined.         You obviously go as hard as you can each week and then you assess the season when the season is over he said.         The motivation in the final three games Coughlin said is not much different from what it has been since Dallas all but dashed the Giants playoff hopes.         We can gain and earn some of the respect back with the way we play these three games Coughlin said.         Coughlin may not have called the final three games an audition for next season but defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka said that need not be stated.         Were always constantly being evaluated; theres a huge turnover every year Kiwanuka said. So we always feel if were playing for our careers and for our jobs. That isnt going to change but when it comes down to it this is one of the toughest seasons we have had.         Because the next game brings such a formidable opponent to MetLife Stadium Kiwanuka said he sensed that the Giants could be inspired.         It helps us as a team because we get an opportunity to go out there and play against the best and to kind of redeem ourselves a little bit he said.         But Cruz said he remained ambivalent.         I dont know if we necessarily want to call ourselves a spoiler team or be in a spoiler role Cruz said. But we just want to go out there and put our best foot forward and win the football game.         That would reverse the most disturbing trend for the Giants: They have lost 13 of their last 21 games and are 14-15 since winning Super Bowl XLVI.

McKINLEY Jr.,413,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/nyregion/new-york-city-subpoenas-secret-tapes-by-police-officer.html,24,New York City lawyers have subpoenaed documents and tape recordings used by a journalist who wrote a book about a New York City police officer who disclosed the manipulation of crime reports at his Brooklyn precinct.         The broadly worded five-page subpoena demands that the writer Graham A. Rayman turn over hundreds of tape recordings that the officer Adrian Schoolcraft made of his superiors at the 81st Precinct as well as reams of notes correspondence and emails.         I have no intention of cooperating Mr. Rayman said. I think it would be malpractice for a journalist to cooperate with a subpoena like this and would have a chilling effect on what all journalists do.         Officer Schoolcraft has sued the city claiming his civil rights were violated in October 2009 when his bosses ordered him arrested and taken to a psychiatric ward at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center where he was detained for six days. He says his superiors orchestrated the hospitalization as a punishment for reporting their misconduct.         Mr. Graham wrote about the officers ordeal in  Ten months ago a judge rebuffed a similar effort by city lawyers to obtain outtakes from a documentary movie by Ken Burns about the five men convicted and later exonerated in the 1989  In that case a federal magistrate ruled that the city had failed to meet the requirements to subpoena nonconfidential material from a journalist: that the material be significant and relevant to the case and that it be unavailable from another source.         But city lawyers contend the Schoolcraft subpoena is different. Mr. Raymans book was based largely on hundreds of tape recordings Mr. Schoolcraft secretly made of his superiors documenting their efforts to discourage victims from reporting crimes to make the precinct look good on paper among other things. He also recorded what was said when he was detained.         Suzanna Publicker Mettham an assistant corporation counsel said the city sought the subpoena only after Officer Schoolcraft asserted that he no longer had copies of what he had given to Mr. Rayman. She described the subpoena as a last resort that met both requirements for overcoming a reporters privilege to protect source materials: They are central to the case and cannot be obtained elsewhere.
