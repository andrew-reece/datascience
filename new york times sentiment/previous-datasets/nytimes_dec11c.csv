When the anthropologist Sarah B. Hrdy  surveyed the research literature  three decades ago she concluded that the competitive component in the nature of women remains anecdotal intuitively sensed but not confirmed by science.         Science has come a long way since then as Dr. Hrdy notes in her introduction to a recent issue of  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society  devoted entirely to the topic of female aggression. She credits the stunning amount of new evidence partly to better research techniques and partly to the entry of so many women into scientific fields once dominated by men.         The existence of female competition may seem obvious to anyone who has been in a high-school cafeteria or a singles bar but analyzing it has been difficult because it tends be more subtle and indirect (and a lot less violent) than the male variety. Now that researchers have been looking more closely they say that this intrasexual competition is the most important factor explaining the pressures that young women feel to meet standards of sexual conduct and physical appearance.         The old doubts about female competitiveness derived partly from an evolutionary analysis of the reproductive odds in ancient  polygynous  societies in which some men were left single because dominant males had multiple wives. So men had to compete to have a chance of reproducing whereas virtually all women were assured of it.         But even in those societies women were not passive trophies for victorious males. They had their own incentives to compete with one another for more desirable partners and more resources for their children. And now that most people live in monogamous societies most women face the same odds as men. In fact they face tougher odds in some places like the many college campuses with more women than men.         To see how female students react to a rival researchers brought pairs of them into a laboratory at McMaster University for what was ostensibly a discussion about female friendships. But the real experiment began when another young woman entered the room asking where to find one of the researchers.         This woman had been chosen by the researchers  Tracy Vaillancourt  and Aanchal Sharma because she embodied qualities considered attractive from an evolutionary perspective meaning a low waist-to-hip ratio clear skin large breasts. Sometimes she wore a T-shirt and jeans other times a tightfitting low-cut blouse and short skirt.         In jeans she  attracted little notice and no negative comments from the students  whose reactions were being secretly recorded during the encounter and after the woman left the room. But when she wore the other outfit virtually all the students reacted with hostility.         They stared at her looked her up and down rolled their eyes and sometimes showed outright anger. One asked her in disgust What the [expletive] is that?         Most of the aggression though happened after she left the room. Then the students laughed about her and impugned her motives. One student suggested that she dressed that way in order to have sex with a professor. Another said that her breasts were about to pop out.         The results of the experiment jibe with evidence that this mean girl form of indirect aggression is used more by adolescents and young women than by older women who have less incentive to handicap rivals once they marry. Other studies have shown that the more attractive an adolescent girl or woman is the more likely she is to become  a target for indirect aggression from her female peers .         Women are indeed very capable of aggressing against others especially women they perceive as rivals said Dr. Vaillancourt now a psychologist at the University of Ottawa. The research also shows that suppression of female sexuality is by women not necessarily by men.         Stigmatizing female promiscuity  a.k.a. slut-shaming  has often been blamed on men who have a Darwinian incentive to discourage their spouses from straying. But they also have a Darwinian incentive to encourage other women to be promiscuous. Dr. Vaillancourt said the experiment and other research suggest  the stigma is enforced mainly by women .         Sex is coveted by men she said. Accordingly women limit access as a way of maintaining advantage in the negotiation of this resource. Women who make sex too readily available compromise the power-holding position of the group which is why many women are particularly intolerant of women who are or seem to be promiscuous.         Indirect aggression can take a psychological toll on women who are ostracized or feel pressured to meet impossible standards like the vogue of thin bodies in many modern societies. Studies have shown that womens ideal body shape is to be thinner than average  and thinner than what men consider the ideal shape to be. This pressure is frequently blamed on the ultrathin female role models featured in magazines and on television but Christopher J. Ferguson and other researchers say that its mainly  the result of competition with their peers not media images .         To a large degree the media reflects trends that are going on in society not creates them said  Dr. Ferguson  a psychologist at Stetson University. He found that womens dissatisfaction with their bodies  did not correlate with what they watched on television  at home. Nor were they influenced by TV programs shown in laboratory experiments: Watching the svelte actresses on Scrubs induced no more feelings of inferiority than watching the not-so-svelte star of Roseanne.         But he found that women were more likely to feel worse when they compared themselves with peers in their own social circles or even if they were in a room with a thin stranger like the assistant to Dr. Ferguson who ran  an experiment  with female college students. When she wore makeup and sleek business attire the students were less satisfied with their own bodies than when she wore baggy sweats and no makeup. And they felt still worse when there was an attractive man in the room with her.         Sexual competition among females seems to increase due to circumstances that tend to be particularly common in affluent societies Dr. Ferguson said.         In traditional villages people married at an early age to someone nearby but young men and women in modern societies are free to postpone marriage as they search long and far for better options. The result is more competition because there are so many more rivals  and theres no longer any scientific doubt that both sexes are in to win it.        
1,100000002581357,1,Article,News,Science,science,,"Baffling 400,000-Year-Old Clue to Human Origins",CARL ZIMMER,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/science/at-400000-years-oldest-human-dna-yet-found-raises-new-mysteries.html,10,Scientists have found the oldest DNA evidence yet of humans biological history. But instead of neatly clarifying human evolution the finding is adding new mysteries.         In a paper in the journal Nature scientists  reported  Wednesday that they had retrieved ancient human DNA from a fossil dating back about 400000 years shattering the previous record of 100000 years.         The fossil a thigh bone found in Spain had previously seemed to many experts to belong to a forerunner of Neanderthals. But its DNA tells a very different story. It most closely resembles DNA from an enigmatic lineage of humans known as Denisovans. Until now Denisovans were known only from DNA retrieved from 80000-year-old remains in Siberia 4000 miles east of where the new DNA was found.         The mismatch between the anatomical and genetic evidence surprised the scientists who are now rethinking human evolution over the past few hundred thousand years. It is possible for example that there are many extinct human populations that scientists have yet to discover. They might have interbred swapping DNA. Scientists hope that further studies of extremely ancient human DNA will clarify the mystery.         Right now weve basically generated a big question mark said Matthias Meyer a geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig Germany and a co-author of the new study.         Hints at new hidden complexities in the human story came from a 400000-year-old femur found in a cave in Spain called Sima de los Huesos (the pit of bones in Spanish). The scientific team used new methods to extract the ancient DNA from the fossil.         This would not have been possible even a year ago said Juan Luis Arsuaga a paleoanthropologist at Universidad Complutense de Madrid and a co-author of the paper.         Finding such ancient human DNA was a major advance said David Reich a geneticist at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the research. Thats an amazing game-changing thing he said.         Since the 1970s Spanish scientists have brought out a wealth of fossils from the cave dating back hundreds of thousands of years. The place is very special said Dr. Arsuaga who has found 28 nearly complete skeletons of humans during three decades of excavations.         Based on the anatomy of the fossils Dr. Arsuaga has argued that they belonged to ancestors of Neanderthals which lived in western Asia and Europe from about 200000 to 30000 years ago.         When Dr. Meyer and his colleagues drilled into the femur they found ancient human DNA inside just as they had hoped.         Our expectation was that it would be a very early Neanderthal Dr. Meyer said.         But the DNA did not match that of Neanderthals. Dr. Meyer then compared it to the DNA of the Denisovans the ancient human lineage that he and his colleagues had discovered in Siberia in 2010. He was shocked to find that it was similar.         Everybody had a hard time believing it at first Dr. Meyer said. So we generated more and more data to nail it down.         The extra research confirmed that the DNA belonged on the Denisovan branch of the human family tree.         The new finding is hard to reconcile with the picture of human evolution that has been emerging based on fossils and ancient DNA. Denisovans were believed to be limited to East Asia and they were not thought to look so Neanderthal-like.         Based on previously discovered ancient DNA and fossil evidence scientists generally agreed that humans direct ancestors shared a common ancestor with Neanderthals and Denisovans that lived about half a million years ago in Africa.         Their shared ancestors split off from humans lineage and left Africa then split further into the Denisovans and Neanderthals about 300000 years ago. The evidence suggested that Neanderthals headed west toward Europe and that the Denisovans moved east.         Humans ancestors meanwhile stayed in Africa giving rise to Homo sapiens about 200000 years ago. Humans then expanded from Africa into Asia and Europe about 60000 years ago. They then interbred not only with Neanderthals but with Denisovans too. Later both the Denisovans and Neanderthals became extinct.         Now we have to rethink the whole story Dr. Arsuaga said.         Dr. Arsuaga doubts that Denisovans were spread out across so much of the Old World from Spain to Siberia masquerading as Neanderthals.         One alternative explanation is that the humans of Sima de los Huesos were not true Neanderthals but belonged to the ancestors of both Denisovans and Neanderthals.         It is also possible that the newly discovered DNA was passed to both Neanderthals and Denisovans but eventually disappeared from Neanderthals replaced by other variants.         It got lost in one lineage but made its way in the other suggested Jean-Jacques Hublin a Max Planck paleoanthropologist who was not involved in the research.         Beth Shapiro an expert on ancient DNA at the University of California Santa Cruz favors an even more radical possibility: that the humans of Sima de los Huesos belong to yet another branch of humans. They might have been a species called Homo erectus which originated about 1.8 million years ago and became extinct within the last few hundred thousand years.         The more we learn from the DNA extracted from these fossils the more complicated the story becomes Dr. Shapiro said.         This complicated story has come to light only because of advances over the past 20 years in retrieving ancient DNA.         When an organism dies its DNA breaks down into smaller and smaller fragments while also becoming contaminated with the DNA of other species like soil bacteria. So piecing the fossil DNA together is a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle created by a sadist.         In 1997 Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute and his colleagues who had pioneered the techniques for retrieving DNA fragments  published  a snippet of DNA from a Neanderthal fossil dating back about 40000 years. They and other scientists then built on this success by searching for bits of DNA from other Neanderthals.         In 2006 a team of French and Belgian researchers obtained a fragment of Neanderthal DNA dating back  100000 years which until now  held the record for the oldest human DNA ever found.         Meanwhile using improved methods Dr. Paabo Dr. Meyer and their colleagues  assembled  a rough draft of the entire Neanderthal genome in 2010.         That discovery shed light on how Neanderthals and humans ancestors split from a common ancestor hundreds of thousands of years ago. It also revealed that Neanderthals and humans interbred  about 50000 years ago .         Around the same time as that discovery Russian collaborators sent the Max Planck team 80000-year-old fossils they had found in a cave in Siberia called Denisova. When the German scientists sequenced the entire genome from the finger bone of a girl it turned out to be neither human nor Neanderthal but from a  separate lineage  which Dr. Paabo and his colleagues named Denisovans.         Dr. Meyer is hopeful that he and his colleagues will be able to get more DNA from the Spanish fossil as well as other fossils from the site to help solve the puzzle they have now stumbled across. Its extremely hard to make sense of Dr. Meyer said. We still are a bit lost here.        
2,100000002555962,1,Article,News,World,world,europe,A Russian GPS Using U.S. Soil Stirs Spy Fears,MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT;ERIC SCHMITT,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/world/europe/a-russian-gps-using-us-soil-stirs-spy-fears.html,1,WASHINGTON  In the view of Americas spy services the next potential threat from  Russia  may not come from a nefarious cyberweapon or secrets gleaned from the files of Edward J. Snowden the former National Security Agency contractor now in Moscow.         Instead this menace may come in the form of a seemingly innocuous dome-topped antenna perched atop an electronics-packed building surrounded by a security fence somewhere in the United States.         In recent months the  Central Intelligence Agency  and the Pentagon have been quietly waging a campaign to stop the State Department from allowing Roscosmos the Russian space agency to build about half a dozen of these structures known as monitor stations on United States soil several American officials said.         They fear that these structures could help Russia spy on the United States and improve the precision of Russian weaponry the officials said. These monitor stations the Russians contend would significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of Moscows version of the Global Positioning System the American satellite network that steers guided missiles to their targets and thirsty smartphone users to the nearest Starbucks.         They dont want to be reliant on the American system and believe that their systems like GPS will spawn other industries and applications said a former senior official in the State Departments Office of Space and Advanced Technology. They feel as though they are losing a technological edge to us in an important market. Look at everything GPS has done on things like your phone and the movement of planes and ships.         The Russian effort is part of a larger global race by several countries  including China and European Union nations  to perfect their own global positioning systems and challenge the dominance of the American GPS.         For the State Department permitting Russia to build the stations would help mend the Obama administrations relationship with the government of President Vladimir V. Putin now at a nadir because of Moscows granting asylum to Mr. Snowden and its backing of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.         But the C.I.A. and other American spy agencies as well as the Pentagon suspect that the monitor stations would give the Russians a foothold on American territory that would sharpen the accuracy of Moscows satellite-steered weapons. The stations they believe could also give the Russians an opening to snoop on the United States within its borders.         The squabble is serious enough that administration officials have delayed a final decision until the Russians provide more information and until the American agencies sort out their differences State Department and White House officials said.         Russias efforts have also stirred concerns on Capitol Hill where members of the intelligence and armed services committees view Moscows global positioning network  known as Glonass for Global Navigation Satellite System  with deep suspicion and are demanding answers from the administration.         I would like to understand why the United States would be interested in enabling a GPS competitor like Russian Glonass when the worlds reliance on GPS is a clear advantage to the United States on multiple levels said Representative Mike D. Rogers Republican of Alabama the chairman of a House Armed Services subcommittee.         Mr. Rogers last week asked the Pentagon to provide an assessment of the proposals impact on national security. The request was made in a letter sent to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel Secretary of State John Kerry and the director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr.         The monitor stations have been a high priority of Mr. Putin for several years as a means to improve Glonass not only to benefit the Russian military and civilian sectors but also to compete globally with GPS.         Earlier this year Russia positioned a station in Brazil and agreements with Spain Indonesia and Australia are expected soon according to Russian news reports. The United States has stations around the world but none in Russia.        
3,100000002579524,1,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Focus Turns to Investigation in Fatal Bronx Train Crash,JAMES BARRON;J. DAVID GOODMAN,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/nyregion/metro-north-derailment.html,1,The 5:54 from Poughkeepsie was rumbling through the Bronx on Sunday morning. Only 100 to 150 people were onboard  department store employees who were bracing for another busy after-Thanksgiving day tourists from Texas who wanted to climb the Statue of Liberty a police officer moonlighting as a security guard on his day off.         Some were dozing when the train rounded a bend near where tracks pass under the Henry Hudson Bridge. Some were listening to music on headphones. Suddenly with a jerk that disrupted the steady trains steady rhythm their world turned upside down as they were hurled from one side to the other.         In the chaos of screeching metal and the shower of debris as the train kept plowing along some passengers grabbed for the luggage racks and held on. Others hugged their seats as the eight cars of the train flew off the tracks and several landed on their sides.         Im thinking Im going into the water said Eddie Russell 48 who had been listening with his eyes closed to LL Cool J. I was thinking of me surviving.         Police and transit officials said four people on board were killed and more than 60 were injured 11 critically. Three of the four dead were thrown from the train after the windows blew out the officials said.         It was not clear how fast the Metro-North train was going. But an official from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the train operator had reported that the train was going into the turn too fast and that he had performed an emergency braking maneuver.         The operator told the first rescuers to reach the scene that he had dumped the brakes according to the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.         Dumping the brakes railroad experts said is a last-resort move that has the effect of slamming on the emergency brakes on all the cars of a train at once. It is usually done to avert a collision with another train or a vehicle at a grade-level crossing.         Officials opened an investigation but cautioned that it would take time to piece together the evidence and identify a possible cause. The National Transportation Safety Board sent investigators to the site with instructions to inspect the overturned cars and interpret information from the trains event recorders devices that are somewhat similar to the flight recorders on airplanes. The Federal Railroad Administration also dispatched a team of investigators.         Earl F. Weener of the transportation safety board said at a morning news conference with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo that investigators had yet to interview the operator of the train who was among those injured. A spokeswoman for Metro-North said the engineer identified as William Rockefeller of Germantown N.Y. had about 14 years experience with the line. There were also three conductors on the train.         Our mission is to not just understand what happened but why it happened with the intent of preventing it from happening again Mr. Weener said.         The accident was the latest episode in a trying year for Metro-North the nations second-largest commuter railroad and the first with passenger fatalities in Metro-Norths 30-year history.         In May two Metro-North trains slammed into each other near Fairfield Conn. during the evening rush. Scores of passengers were hurt five critically.         And in July a CSX freight train derailed near where the Metro-North train left the tracks on Sunday. Officials said there was no connection between the accidents.         By Sunday night the transportation safety board had given Metro-North clearance to begin removing the crippled train and repairing the tracks. But the crash was likely to disrupt the Monday commute for thousands of passengers on the railroads Hudson line. Metro-North arranged for buses to take Hudson line passengers to White Plains N.Y. on Sunday to catch trains on a different line that was running normally. On Monday Hudson line trains will be running as far south as Yonkers where passengers will be able to catch buses to the 242nd Street station of the No. 1 train.        
4,100000002551219,1,Article,News,Health,health,,Car Mechanic Dreams Up a Tool to Ease Births,DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/health/new-tool-to-ease-difficult-births-a-plastic-bag.html,1,The idea came to Jorge OdÃ³n as he slept. Somehow he said his unconscious made the leap from a  YouTube video  he had just seen on extracting a lost cork from a wine bottle to the realization that the same parlor trick could save a baby stuck in the birth canal.         Mr. OdÃ³n 59 an Argentine car mechanic built his first prototype in his kitchen using a glass jar for a womb his daughters doll for the trapped baby and a fabric bag and sleeve sewn by his wife as his lifesaving device.         Unlikely as it seems the idea that took shape on his counter has won  the enthusiastic endorsement  of the  World Health Organization  and major donors and an American medical technology company has just licensed it for production.         With the OdÃ³n Device an attendant slips a plastic bag inside a lubricated plastic sleeve around the head inflates it to grip the head and pulls the bag until the baby emerges.         Doctors say it has enormous potential to save babies in poor countries and perhaps to reduce  cesarean section  births in rich ones.         This is very exciting said Dr. Mario Merialdi the W.H.O.s chief coordinator for improving maternal and perinatal health and an early champion of the OdÃ³n Device. This critical moment of life is one in which theres been very little advancement for years.         About 10 percent of the 137 million births worldwide each year have potentially serious complications Dr. Merialdi said. About 5.6 million babies are stillborn or die quickly and about 260000 women die in childbirth. Obstructed labor which can occur when a babys head is too large or an exhausted mothers contractions stop is a major factor.         In wealthy countries fetal distress results in a rush to the operating room. In poor rural clinics Dr. Merialdi said if the baby doesnt come out the woman is on her own.         The  current options  in those cases are forceps  large rounded pliers  or suction cups attached to the babys scalp. In untrained hands either can cause hemorrhages crush the babys head or twist its spine.         Although more testing is planned on the OdÃ³n Device doctors said it appeared to be safe for  midwives  with minimal training to use.         Along the way it has won research grants from the United States Agency for International Development and from Grand Challenges Canada. Weve given out $32 million for 61 different innovations and this one is the farthest along said Dr. Peter A. Singer the chief executive of Grand Challenges Canada.         The device will be manufactured by Becton Dickinson and Company or BD of Franklin Lakes N.J. which is better known for making syringes.         My first reaction as soon as I saw it was positive said Gary M. Cohen the companys executive vice president for global health. It was at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland that Dr. Merialdi asked him to consider taking it on.         Many inventions get to the prototype stage but thats maybe 15 percent of what needs to be done Mr. Cohen said. Theres finalizing the design for manufacture quality control the regulatory work and clinical studies. Absent that they dont see the light of day.         So far the device has been safety-tested only on 30 Argentine women all of whom were in hospitals had given birth before and were in normal labor.         I was glad they asked me because it was for a good cause said Luciana Valle a kindergarten teacher who was 31 two years ago when her son Matteo was one of the first babies extracted with the device. Because Matteo weighed almost nine pounds it really helped she said in a telephone interview. His head came out on my second push.         The W.H.O. will now oversee tests on 100 more women in normal labor in China India and South Africa and then on 170 women in obstructed labor.         In a telephone interview from  Argentina  Mr. OdÃ³n  described the origins  of his idea.         He tinkers at his garage but his previous inventions were car parts. Seven years ago he said employees were imitating a video showing that a cork pushed into an empty bottle can be retrieved by inserting a plastic grocery bag blowing until it surrounds the cork and drawing it out.         That night he won a dinner bet on it.         At 4 a.m. he woke his wife and told her the idea that had just come to him. (His own children were born without problems he said but he has an aunt who suffered nerve damage from birth.)         His wife he recalled said I was crazy and went back to sleep.         The next morning a somewhat skeptical friend introduced him to an obstetrician. You can imagine these two guys in suits in a waiting room full of pregnant ladies he said.         The doctor was encouraging so he kept working. Polyethylene replaced the bag his wife had sewn and the jar was replaced by a plastic uterus.         With the help of a cousin Mr. OdÃ³n met the chief of obstetrics at a major hospital in Buenos Aires. The chief had a friend at the W.H.O. who knew Dr. Merialdi who at a 2008 medical conference in Argentina granted Mr. OdÃ³n 10 minutes during a coffee break.         The meeting instead lasted two hours. At the end Dr. Merialdi declared the idea fantastic and arranged for testing at the  Des Moines University simulation lab  which has mannequins more true-to-life than a doll and a jar.         Since then Mr. OdÃ³n has continued to refine the device patenting each change so he will eventually earn royalties on it.         My daughter said And now I can have my doll backÂ  he said.         It is too early to know what BD will charge Mr. Cohen said but each device should cost less than $50 to make. While the company expects to profit on all sales it will charge poor countries less.         Dr. Merialdi said he endorsed a modest profit motive because he had seen other lifesaving ideas languish for lack of it. He cited magnesium sulfate injections which can prevent fatal  eclampsia  and corticosteroids which speed lung development in premature infants.         But first this problem needed someone like Jorge he said. An obstetrician would have tried to improve the forceps or the vacuum extractor but obstructed labor needed a mechanic. And 10 years ago this would not have been possible. Without YouTube he never would have seen the video.        
5,100000002546481,1,Article,News,Health,health,,Experts Reshape Treatment Guide for Cholesterol,GINA KOLATA,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/health/new-guidelines-redefine-use-of-statins.html,1,The nations leading heart organizations released new guidelines on Tuesday that will fundamentally reshape the use of cholesterol-lowering statin medicines which are now prescribed for a quarter of Americans over 40. Patients on statins will no longer need to lower their cholesterol levels to specific numerical targets monitored by regular blood tests as has been recommended for decades. Simply taking the right dose of a statin will be sufficient the guidelines say.         The  new approach  divides people needing treatment into two broad risk categories. Those at high risk because for example they have diabetes or have had a heart attack should take a statin except in rare cases. People with extremely high levels of the harmful cholesterol known as LDL  190 or higher  should also be prescribed statins. In the past people in these categories would also have been told to get their LDL down to 70 something no longer required.         Everyone else should be considered for a statin if his or her risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years is at least 7.5 percent. Doctors are advised to use a  new risk calculator  that factors in blood pressure age and total cholesterol levels among other things.         Now one in four Americans over 40 will be saying Should I be taking this anymore?  said Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Yale who was not on the guidelines committee.         The  new guidelines  formulated by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology and based on a four-year review of the evidence simplify the current complex five-step process for evaluating who needs to take statins. In a significant departure the new method also counts strokes as well as heart attacks in its risk calculations a step that will probably make some additional people candidates for the drugs.         It is not clear whether more or fewer people will end up taking the drugs under the new guidelines experts said. Many women and African-Americans who have a higher-than-average risk of stroke may find themselves candidates for treatment but others taking statins only to lower LDL cholesterol to target levels may no longer need them.         The previous guidelines put such a strong emphasis on lowering cholesterol levels by specific amounts that patients who did not hit their target levels just by taking statins often were prescribed additional drugs like Zetia made by Merck. But the new guidelines say doctors should no longer prescribe those extra medicines because they have never been shown to prevent heart attacks or strokes.         Zetia has been viewed with increasing skepticism in recent years since studies showed it lowered LDL cholesterol but did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or death. Still it is among Mercks top-selling drugs earning $2.6 billion last year. Another drug Vytorin which combines Zetia with a statin brought in $1.8 billion in 2012 according to company filings. And in May  Merck won approval for another drug  Liptruzet which also contains the active ingredient in Zetia and a statin a development that surprised many cardiologists because of questions about its effectiveness.         The new guidelines are part of a package of recommendations to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke that includes moderate exercise and a healthy diet. But its advice on cholesterol is the flash point arousing the ire of critics who say the authors ignored evidence that did not come from gold-standard clinical trials and should also have counted less rigorous but compelling data.         For example Dr. Daniel J. Rader the director of the preventive cardiovascular medicine and lipid clinic at the University of Pennsylvania points to studies of people with genes giving them low LDL levels over a lifetime. Their heart attack rate is greatly reduced he said suggesting the benefits of long-term cholesterol reduction.         Committee members counter his view saying that cholesterol lowered by drugs may not have the same effect.         Critics also question the use of a 10-year risk of heart attack or stroke as the measure for determining who should be treated. Many people will have a lower risk simply because they are younger yet could benefit from taking statins for decades to keep their cholesterol levels low they say.         Dr. Rader and other experts also worry that without the goad of target numbers patients and their doctors will lose motivation to control cholesterol levels.         Experts say it is still unclear how much the new guidelines will change clinical practice. Dr. Rader suspects many cardiologists will still strive for the old LDL targets at least for patients with heart disease who are at high risk. They are used to it and believe in it he said.         Dr. Steven E. Nissen a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic said he thought it would take years for doctors to change their practices.        
6,100000002564705,1,Article,News Analysis,U.S.,us,politics,Partisan Fever in Senate Likely to Rise,JONATHAN WEISMAN,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/us/politics/a-move-years-in-the-making-with-lasting-ramifications.html,1,WASHINGTON  President Obama will get a short-term lift for his nominees judicial and otherwise but over the immediate horizon the strong-arm move by Senate Democrats on Thursday to limit filibusters could usher in an era of rank partisan warfare beyond even what Americans have seen in the past five years.         Ultimately a small group of centrists  Republicans and Democrats  could find the muscle to hold the Senate at bay until bipartisan solutions can be found. But for the foreseeable future Republicans wounded and eager to show they have not been stripped of all power are far more likely to unify against the Democrats who humiliated them in such dramatic fashion.         This is the most important and most dangerous restructuring of Senate rules since Thomas Jefferson wrote them at the beginning of our country declared Senator Lamar Alexander Republican of Tennessee. Its another raw exercise of political power to permit the majority to do whatever it wants whenever it wants to do it.         The decision to press the button on the so-called nuclear option was no doubt cathartic for a Democratic majority driven to distraction by Republican obstructionism. President Obama had predicted his re-election would break the partisan fever gripping Washington especially since the Tea Party movement swept Republicans to control of the House. It did not.         Doing nothing was no longer an option said Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico one of a new breed of Democrats who have pressed to reform Senate rules.         But the fever is hardly gone. The rule change lowered to a simple 51-vote majority the threshold to clear procedural hurdles on the way to the confirmation of judges and executive nominees. But it did nothing to streamline the gantlet that presidential nominees run. Republicans may not be able to muster the votes to block Democrats on procedure but they can force every nomination into days of debate between every procedural vote in the Senate book  of which there will be many.         And legislation at least for now is still very much subject to the filibuster. On Thursday afternoon as one Republican after another went to the Senate floor to lament the end of one type of filibuster they voted against cutting off debate on the annual defense policy bill a measure that has passed with bipartisan support every year for decades.         Todays historic change to Senate rules escalates what is already a hyperpartisan atmosphere in Washington which is already preventing Congress from addressing our nations most significant challenges said former Senator Olympia Snowe a Republican and former Representative Dan Glickman a Democrat in a joint statement from the Bipartisan Policy Center.         Republican senators who were willing to team with Democrats on legislation like an immigration overhaul farm policy and a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act will probably think twice in the future.         Well have to see but I think it was certainly unfortunate said Senator Susan Collins a Maine Republican who has often worked with Democrats.         Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the Republican leader made clear that he hoped to exact the ultimate revenge taking back control of the Senate and using the new rules against the Democrats who made them. The solution to this problem is at the ballot box he said. We look forward to having a great election.         David Axelrod a former top adviser to Mr. Obama said retaliation by Republicans against the presidents broader agenda would end up hurting them more than Democrats. If their answer is Oh yeah we can make it even worse I think they do that at great risk Mr. Axelrod said. They have to make a decision about whether they want to be a shrinking shrieking blocking party or if they are going to be a national party.         From the moment Mr. Obama took office the president who proclaimed that there was no red America and blue America only the United States of America has strained to maintain some pretense of bipartisanship  through protracted and fruitless efforts to woo Republicans on his economic stimulus plan and health care law through dinner dates with some handpicked Republican friends through the nomination of Chuck Hagel a former Republican senator to lead the Defense Department.        
7,100000002564123,1,Article,News,U.S.,us,politics,"In Landmark Vote, Senate Limits Use of the Filibuster",JEREMY W. PETERS,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/us/politics/reid-sets-in-motion-steps-to-limit-use-of-filibuster.html,1,WASHINGTON  The Senate approved the most fundamental alteration of its rules in more than a generation on Thursday ending the minority partys ability to filibuster most presidential nominees in response to the partisan gridlock that has plagued Congress for much of the Obama administration.         Furious Republicans accused Democrats of a power grab warning them that they would deeply regret their action if they lost control of the Senate next year and the White House in years to come. Invoking the Founding Fathers and the meaning of the Constitution Republicans said Democrats were trampling the minority rights the framers intended to protect. But when the vote was called Senator Harry Reid the majority leader who was initially reluctant to force the issue prevailed 52 to 48.         Under the change the Senate will be able to cut off debate on executive and judicial branch nominees with a simple majority rather than rounding up a supermajority of 60 votes. The new precedent established by the Senate on Thursday does not apply to Supreme Court nominations or legislation itself.         It represented the culmination of years of frustration over what Democrats denounced as a Republican campaign to stall the machinery of Congress stymie President Obamas agenda and block his choices for cabinet posts and federal judgeships by insisting that virtually everything the Senate approves be done by a supermajority.         After repeatedly threatening to change the rules Mr. Reid decided to follow through when Republicans refused this week to back down from their effort to keep Mr. Obama from filling any of three vacancies on the most powerful appeals court in the country.         This was the final straw for some Democratic holdouts against limiting the filibuster providing Mr. Reid with the votes he needed to impose a new standard certain to reverberate through the Senate for years.         There has been unbelievable unprecedented obstruction Mr. Reid said as he set in motion the steps for the vote on Thursday. The Senate is a living thing and to survive it must change as it has over the history of this great country. To the average American adapting the rules to make the Senate work again is just common sense.         Republicans accused Democrats of irreparably damaging the character of an institution that in many ways still operates as it did in the 19th century and of disregarding the constitutional prerogative of the Senate as a body of advice and consent on presidential nominations.         You think this is in the best interest of the United States Senate and the American people? asked the Republican leader Senator Mitch McConnell sounding incredulous.         I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle youll regret this. And you may regret it a lot sooner than you think he added.         Mr. Obama applauded the Senates move. Todays pattern of obstruction it just isnt normal he told reporters at the White House. Its not what our founders envisioned. A deliberate and determined effort to obstruct everything no matter what the merits just to refight the results of an election is not normal and for the sake of future generations we cant let it become normal.         Only three Democrats voted against the measure.         The changes will apply to all 1183 executive branch nominations that require Senate confirmation  not just cabinet positions but hundreds of high- and midlevel federal agency jobs and government board seats.         This fight was a climax to the bitter debate between the parties over electoral mandates and the consequences of presidential elections. Republicans through their frequent use of the various roadblocks that congressional procedure affords them have routinely thwarted Democrats. Democrats in turn have accused Republicans of effectively trying to nullify the results of a presidential election they lost whether by trying to dismantle his health care law or keep Mr. Obama from filling his cabinet.        
8,100000002579667,1,Article,News,Business Day,business,economy,Wage Strikes Planned at Fast-Food Outlets,STEVEN GREENHOUSE,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/business/economy/wage-strikes-planned-at-fast-food-outlets-in-100-cities.html,2,Seeking to increase pressure on McDonalds Wendys and other fast-food restaurants organizers of a movement demanding a $15-an-hour wage for fast-food workers say they will sponsor one-day strikes in 100 cities on Thursday and protest activities in 100 additional cities.         As the movement struggles to find pressure points in its quest for substantially higher wages for workers organizers said strikes were planned for the first time in cities like Charleston S.C.; Providence R.I.; and Pittsburgh.         The protests have expanded greatly since November 2012 when 200 fast-food workers engaged in a one-day strike at more than 20 restaurants in New York City the first such walkout in the history of the nations fast-food industry.         Theres been pretty huge growth in one year said Kendall Fells one of the movements main organizers. People understand that a one-day strike is not going to get them there. They understand that this needs to continue to grow.         The movement which includes the groups  Fast Food Forward  and  Fight for 15  is part of a growing union-backed effort by low-paid workers  including many Walmart workers and workers for federal contractors  that seeks to focus attention on what the groups say are inadequate wages.         The fast-food effort is backed by the Service Employees International Union and is also demanding that restaurants allow workers to unionize without the threat of retaliation.         Officials with the National Restaurant Association have said the one-day strikes are publicity stunts. They warn that increasing pay to $15 an hour when the federal minimum wage is $7.25 would cause restaurants to rely more on automation and hire fewer workers.         Industry officials say that only a small percentage of fast-food jobs pay the minimum wage and that those are largely entry-level jobs for workers under 25.         Backers of the movement for higher pay point to studies saying that the average age of fast-food workers is 29 and that more than one-fourth are parents raising children.         Simon Rojas who earns $8.07 an hour working at a McDonalds in South Central Los Angeles said he would join Thursdays one-day strike.         Its very difficult to live off $8.07 an hour said Mr. Rojas 23 noting that he is often assigned just 20 or 25 hours of work a week. I have to live with my parents. I would like to be able to afford a car and an apartment.         Mr. Rojas said he had studied for a pharmacy technicians certificate but he had been unable to save the $100 needed to apply for a license.         On Aug. 29 fast-food strikes took place in more than 50 cities. This weeks expanded protests will be joined by numerous community faith and student groups including USAction and United Students against Sweatshops.        
9,nYvCOuhk7iDe71QSAc8neA,1,Blogs,Blog Post,Health,Health,well,The Power of a Daily Bout of Exercise,GRETCHEN REYNOLDS,,http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/the-power-of-a-daily-bout-of-exercise/,,This week marks the start of the annual eat-too-much and move-too-little holiday season with its attendant declining health and surging regrets. But a well-timed new study suggests that a daily bout of exercise should erase or lessen many of the injurious effects even if you otherwise lounge all day on the couch and load up on pie. To undertake this valuable experiment which was  published online in The Journal of Physiology  scientists at the University of Bath in England rounded up a group of 26 healthy young men. All exercised regularly. None were obese. Baseline health assessments including biopsies of fat tissue confirmed that each had normal metabolisms and blood sugar control with no symptoms of incipient diabetes.  The scientists then asked their volunteers to impair their laudable health by doing a lot of sitting and gorging themselves.  Energy surplus is the technical name for those occasions when people consume more energy in the form of calories than they burn. If unchecked energy surplus contributes as we all know to a variety of poor health outcomes including insulin resistance — often the first step toward diabetes — and other metabolic problems.   Overeating and inactivity can each on its own produce an energy surplus. Together their ill effects are exacerbated often in a very short period of time. Earlier studies have found that even a few days of inactivity and overeating spark detrimental changes in previously healthy bodies.   Some of these experiments have also concluded that exercise blunts the ill effects of these behaviors in large part it has been assumed by reducing the energy surplus. It burns some of the excess calories. But a few scientists have suspected that exercise might do more; it might have physiological effects that extend beyond just incinerating surplus energy.  To test that possibility of course it would be necessary to maintain an energy surplus even with exercise. So that is what the University of Bath researchers decided to do.  Their method was simple. They randomly divided their volunteers into two groups one of which was assigned to run every day at a moderately intense pace on a treadmill for 45 minutes. The other group did not exercise.  Meanwhile the men in both groups were told to generally stop moving so much decreasing the number of steps that they took each day from more than 10000 on average to fewer than 4000 as gauged by pedometers. The exercising group’s treadmill workouts were not included in their step counts. Except when they were running they were as inactive as the other group. Both groups also were directed to start substantially overeating. The group that was not exercising increased their daily caloric intake by 50 percent compared with what it had been before while the exercising group consumed almost 75 percent more calories than previously with the additional 25 percent replacing the energy burned during training.  Over all the two groups’ net daily energy surplus was the same.  The experiment continued for seven days. Then both groups returned to the lab for additional testing including new insulin measurements and another biopsy of fat tissue.  The results were striking. After only a week the young men who had not exercised displayed a significant and unhealthy decline in their blood sugar control and equally worrying their biopsied fat cells seemed to have developed a malicious streak. Those cells examined using sophisticated genetic testing techniques were now overexpressing various genes that may contribute to unhealthy metabolic changes and underexpressing other genes potentially important for a well-functioning metabolism.  But the volunteers who had exercised once a day despite comparable energy surpluses were not similarly afflicted. Their blood sugar control remained robust and their fat cells exhibited far fewer of the potentially undesirable alterations in gene expression than among the sedentary men.  “Exercise seemed to completely cancel out many of the changes induced by overfeeding and reduced activity” said Dylan Thompson a professor of health sciences at the University of Bath and senior author of the study. And where it did not countermand the impacts he continued it “softened” them leaving the exercise group “better off than the nonexercise group” despite engaging in equivalently insalubrious behavior.  From a scientific standpoint this finding intimates that the metabolic effects of overeating and inactivity are multifaceted Dr. Thompson said with an energy surplus sparking genetic as well as other physiological changes. But just how exercise countermands those effects is impossible to say based on the new experiment he added. Differences in how each group’s metabolism utilized fats and carbohydrates could play a role he said as could the release of certain molecules from exercising muscles which only occurred among the men who ran.  Of more pressing interest though is the study’s practical message that “if you are facing a period of overconsumption and inactivity” — also known as the holidays — “a daily bout of exercise will prevent many of the negative changes at least in the short term” Dr. Thompson said. Of course his study involved young fit men and a relatively prolonged period of exercise. But the findings likely apply he said to other groups like older adults and women and perhaps to lesser amounts of training. That’s a possibility worth embracing as the pie servings accumulate.

10,WZLhHcXC62qvj1hhTIdYmA,1,Blogs,Blog Post,Health,Health,well,"In Hookups, Inequality Still Reigns ",NATALIE KITROEFF,,http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/women-find-orgasms-elusive-in-hookups/,,Natasha Gadinsky 23 says she doesn’t have any regrets from her years in college. But the time she hooked up with a guy at Brown University does come close. After his own orgasm that night she said he showed no interest in her satisfaction. The next time they got together it happened again. He “didn’t even care” said Ms. Gadinsky a health care case manager in New York City. “I don’t think he tried at all.” He fell asleep immediately leaving her staring at the ceiling. “I was really frustrated” she said. Like generations before them many young women like Ms. Gadinsky are finding that casual sex does not bring the physical pleasure that men more often experience. New research suggests why: Women are less likely to have orgasms during uncommitted sexual encounters than in serious relationships. At the same time researchers say that young women are becoming equal partners in the hookup culture often just as willing as young men to venture into sexual relationships without emotional ties. “The notion of sexual liberation where men and women both had equal access to casual sex assumed a comparable likelihood of that sex being pleasurable” said  Kim Wallen  a professor of neuroendocrinology at Emory University who studies female desire. “But that part of the playing field isn’t level.” Research involving 600 college students  led by Justin R. Garcia an evolutionary biologist at the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University and researchers at Binghamton University found that women were twice as likely to reach orgasm from intercourse or oral sex in serious relationships as in hookups. The paper was presented at the annual meeting of the  International Academy of Sex Research  and at the Annual Convention for Psychological Science this year. Similarly a  study of 24000 students at 21 colleges over five years  found that about 40 percent of women had an orgasm during their last hookup involving intercourse while 80 percent of men did. The research was led by  Paula England  a sociologist at New York University who studies the dynamics of casual sex. By contrast roughly three quarters of women in the survey said they had an orgasm the last time they had sex in a committed relationship. “We attribute that to practice with a partner which yields better success at orgasm and we also think the guys care more in a relationship” Dr. England said. Indeed young men surveyed in Dr. England’s study often admitted that they are less focused on sexually pleasing a woman they are seeing casually than one they are dating. Duvan Giraldo 26 a software technician in Elmhurst Queens said that satisfying a partner “is always my mission” but added “I’m not going to try as hard as when I’m with someone I really care about.” And with women he’s just met he said it can be awkward to talk about specific needs in the bedroom. “You’re practically just strangers at that point” he said. The lack of guidance is common Dr. England said. “Women are not feeling very free in these casual contexts to say what they want and need” she said. Part of the problem she added is that women still may be stigmatized for having casual sex. Dr. Garcia said “We’ve been sold this bill of goods that we’re in an era where people can be sexually free and participate equally in the hookup culture. The fact is that not everyone’s having a good time.” What women need to achieve orgasm can be very different from what they find in casual sex. Roughly one-quarter of women reliably experience orgasm through intercourse alone according to a review of 32 studies conducted by  Elisabeth Lloyd  a professor of the history and philosophy of science at Indiana University in her 2005 book “The Case of the Female Orgasm: Bias in the Science of Evolution.” Another third of women rarely or never have orgasms from intercourse. Vanessa Martini 23 from Marin County Calif. learned early on that most men she slept with casually would not intuit her needs. “I haven’t hooked up with anybody who was so cavalier as to just like not even care” she said. “But I think most of them were somewhat baffled that it would require more than just them thrusting.” Ms. Martini said she was never taught how to have good sex let alone how to ask for what she needs. The education she received in school was aimed at stopping teenagers from having sex at all; there wasn’t much discussion of arousal. Ms. Martini said most cultural representations of sex left out the messy details. “The way we view sex in porn and in movies and in books people aren’t talking to each other like ‘Oh my foot’s falling asleep we need to move’” she said. Communicating about those particulars is especially tricky in hookups. When one awkward exchange or misread text message could end the arrangement altogether there’s a certain amount of pressure to tread softly Ms. Martini said. “You have to balance a lot of things in your brain like what’s more important to me — just getting off or do I actually want to have a connection with this person?” Debra Herbenick  a research scientist at Indiana University said that for women casual sex is exciting precisely because it is spontaneous. She compared a hookup with having dinner at a friend’s house. “You wouldn’t be like ‘This is what I want and this is how I want you to make it and I want you to use only this amount of basil’” she said. Some women confronted with these roadblocks are redefining casual sex and the physical pleasure that they expect from it. Sex without strings has carnal and emotional benefits that don’t depend on reaching orgasm they say. “Something we don’t talk about is why having an orgasm is the main goal or the only goal” of sex Dr. Herbenick said. “Who are we to say women should be having orgasms?” Casey Romaine a 22-year-old Bard College graduate living in Nashville Tenn. said that more than sex hookups are often much more about two people giving each other the sense of intimacy however brief they need to get through the week. “It’s just sort of like having the experience and having somebody that you can call or you can like whose house you can spend the night in if you don’t feel like you want to be going home alone” she said. “I think a lot of the time it almost is weirdly irrelevant whether or not the sex is actually good.” For Kim Huynh a 29-year-old filmmaker in San Francisco sacrificing a reliable orgasm for sex without the burden of commitment was a conscious decision. After a couple of relationships in college Ms. Huynh spent about five years without a serious boyfriend and many on-again off-again flings. “As far as my ability to climax consistently that’s something I was able to have in my monogamous relationships that I never had” in less committed circumstances she said. Yet mediocre sex was a small price to pay “for the freedom to be able to enjoy it all.” The physical aspect of a tryst with a relative stranger was gratifying she said even if her chances of reaching orgasm were limited. When her partner’s performance was lackluster she still took pride in her own sexual prowess. “To sort of know yourself to be sort of skilled in a way or to be able to see someone else’s pleasure that was your own doing I think there’s definitely something very empowering about that” she said.

11,100000002545890,1,Article,News,U.S.,us,,Backlash by the Bay: Tech Riches Alter a City,ERICA GOODE;CLAIRE CAIN MILLER,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/us/backlash-by-the-bay-tech-riches-alter-a-city.html,1,SAN FRANCISCO  If there was a tipping point a moment that crystallized the anger building here toward the so-called technorati for driving up housing prices and threatening the citys bohemian identity it came in response to a diatribe posted online in August by a young Internet entrepreneur.         The author a start-up founder named Peter Shih listed 10 things he hated about San Francisco. Homeless people for example. And the constantly PMSing weather. And girls who are obviously 4s and behave like theyre 9s.         The backlash was immediate. Fliers appeared on telephone poles calling Mr. Shih a woman hatin nerd toucher.  CheapAir offered him a free ticket back to New York . Readers responded that what they hated about San Francisco were entitled technology workers like him.         Mr. Shih who said he received death threats after the post deleted it and apologized.         But a nerve had been struck. As the  center of the technology industry has moved north  from Silicon Valley to San Francisco and the largess from tech companies has flowed into the city  Twitters stock offering unleashed  an estimated 1600 new millionaires   income disparities have widened sharply housing prices have soared and orange construction cranes dot the skyline. The tech workers have rightly or wrongly received the blame.         Resentment simmers at the fleets of Google buses that ferry workers to the companys headquarters in Mountain View and back; the code jockeys who crowd elite coffeehouses heads buried in their laptops; and the sleek black  Uber cars  that whisk hipsters from bar to bar. Late last month two tech millionaires opened  the Battery  an invitation-only $2400-a-year club in an old factory in the financial district cars lining up for valet parking.         For critics such sights are symbols of a city in danger of losing its diversity  one that artists families and middle-class workers can no longer afford. On the day of  Twitters public offering  this month 150 demonstrators protested outside the company with signs reading People not profit and Were the public what are you offering?         More and more longtime residents are being forced out as landlords and speculators race to capitalize on the money stream.         Mary Elizabeth Phillips a retired accountant is fighting eviction from the rent-controlled apartment where she has lived for almost half a century. If her new landlords have their way she will have to move in April shortly after her 98th birthday because they want to sell the units.         Her neighborhood has given way around her. The car dealership across the street is now a luxury apartment complex complete with rooftop herb garden a butterfly habitat and a Whole Foods.         I can understand it from an investment standpoint she said of her landlords actions. But I dont think Id ever be that coldblooded about this.         While the technology boom has bred hostility it has also brought San Francisco undeniable benefits. Mayor Edwin M. Lee credits the technology sector with helping to pull the city out of the recession creating jobs and nourishing a thriving economy that is the envy of cash-starved cities across the country.         The industry is not so much taking over but complementing the job creation we want in the city Mr. Lee said while giving a tour of middle Market Street to show off its renaissance from a seedy skid row to a tech district where Twitter Square and other companies have made their home.         Yet city officials must grapple with the arithmetic of squeezing more people into the limited space afforded by San Franciscos 49 square miles. And it is the housing shortage that underlies much of the sniping about tech workers.         San Francisco has the least affordable housing in the nation with just 14 percent of homes accessible to middle-class buyers said Jed Kolko chief economist at the real estate website  Trulia . The median rent is also the highest in the country at $3250 a month for a two-bedroom apartment.         Affordable housing projects are constructed and the money set aside for that purpose is used but the demand is just far greater than what can be supplied said Fred Brousseau of the city budget and legislative analysts office. Evictions under a provision of state law that allows landlords to evict rent-controlled tenants if they convert a building for sale have more than tripled in the past three years just as they did during the first tech boom.         To Yelly Brandon a 36-year-old hairstylist and her boyfriend Anthony Rocco an archivist the obstacles to finding housing became clear when they spent two months searching for an apartment. At open houses they said they were competing with young tech workers who offered more than the asking price and cash up front.         People were just throwing money in the air Ms. Brandon said.         The influx of wealth is in turn changing the tenor of neighborhoods.  Fort Mason  a renovated military post on the bay has been nicknamed  Frat Mason  for the 20-something tech bros  tech company salespeople marketing employees and start-up founders  who have moved into luxury apartments there and play bocce on the great lawn.

The first is that the boys DNA matches that of Western Europeans showing that during the last Ice Age people from Europe had reached farther east across Eurasia than previously supposed. Though none of the Malta boys skin or hair survives his genes suggest he would have had brown hair brown eyes and freckled skin.         The second surprise is that his DNA also matches a large proportion  about 25 percent  of the DNA of living Native Americans. The first people to arrive in the Americas have long been assumed to have descended from Siberian populations related to East Asians. It now seems that they may be a mixture between the Western Europeans who had reached Siberia and an East Asian population.         The Malta boy was 3 to 4 years old and was buried under a stone slab wearing an ivory diadem a bead necklace and a bird-shaped pendant. Elsewhere at the same site about 30 Venus figurines were found of the kind produced by the Upper Paleolithic cultures of Europe. The remains were excavated by Russian archaeologists over a 20-year period ending in 1958 and stored in museums in St. Petersburg.         There they lay for some 50 years until they were examined by a team led by  Eske Willerslev  of the University of Copenhagen. Dr. Willerslev an expert in analyzing ancient DNA was seeking to understand the peopling of the Americas by searching for possible source populations in Siberia. He extracted DNA from bone taken from the childs upper arm hoping to find ancestry in the East Asian peoples from whom Native Americans are known to be descended.         But the first results were disappointing. The boys mitochondrial DNA belonged to the lineage known as U which is commonly found among the modern humans who first entered Europe about 44000 years ago. The lineages found among Native Americans are those designated A B C D and X so the U lineage pointed to contamination of the bone by the archaeologists or museum curators who had handled it a common problem with ancient DNA projects. The study was put on low speed for about a year because I thought it was all contamination Dr. Willerslev said.         His team proceeded anyway to analyze the nuclear genome which contains the major part of human inheritance. They were amazed when the nuclear genome also turned out to have partly European ancestry. Examining the genome from a second Siberian grave site that of an adult who died 17000 years ago they found the same markers of European origin. Together the two genomes indicate that descendants of the modern humans who entered Europe had spread much farther east across Eurasia than had previously been assumed and occupied Siberia during an extremely cold period starting 20000 years ago that is known as the Last Glacial Maximum.         The other surprise from the Malta boys genome was that it matched to both Europeans and Native Americans but not to East Asians. Dr. Willerslevs interpretation was that the ancestors of Native Americans had already separated from the East Asian population when they interbred with the people of the Malta culture and that this admixed population then crossed over the Beringian land bridge that then lay between Siberia and Alaska to become a founding population of Native Americans.         We estimate that 14 to 38 percent of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population he and colleagues wrote in an article published Wednesday in the journal  Nature .         A European contribution to Native American ancestry could explain two longstanding puzzles about the peoples origins. One is that many ancient Native American skulls including that of the well-known Kennewick man look very different from those of the present day population. Another is that one of the five mitochondrial DNA lineages found in Native Americans the lineage known as X also occurs in Europeans. One explanation is that Europeans managed to cross the Atlantic in small boats some 20000 years ago and joined the Native Americans from Siberia.         Dr. Willerslev thinks it more likely that European bearers of the X lineage had migrated across Siberia with the ancestors of the Malta culture and joined them in their trek across the Beringian land bridge.        
13,100000002564912,1,Article,News,Health,health,,The Changing American Family,NATALIE ANGIER,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/health/families.html,,American households have never been more diverse more surprising more baffling. In this special issue of Science Times NATALIE ANGIER takes stock of our changing definition of family. CHELSEA MICH.  Kristi and Michael Burns have a lot in common. They love crossword puzzles football going to museums and reading five or six books at a time. They describe themselves as mild-mannered introverts who suffer from an array of chronic medical problems. The two share similar marital rÃ©sumÃ©s too. On their wedding day in 2011 the groom was 43 years old and the bride 39 yet it was marriage No. 3 for both.         Today their blended family is a sprawling sometimes uneasy ensemble of two sharp-eyed sons from her two previous husbands a daughter and son from his second marriage ex-spouses of varying degrees of involvement the partners of ex-spouses the bemused in-laws and a kitten named Agnes that likes to sleep on computer keyboards.         If the Burnses seem atypical as an American nuclear family how about the Schulte-Waysers a merry band of two married dads six kids and two dogs? Or the Indrakrishnans a successful immigrant couple in Atlanta whose teenage daughter divides her time between prosaic homework and the precision footwork of ancient Hindu dance; the Glusacs of Los Angeles with their two nearly grown children and their litany of middle-class challenges that seem like minor sagas; Ana Perez and Julian Hill of Harlem unmarried and just getting by but with Warren Buffett-size dreams for their three young children; and the alarming number of families with incarcerated parents a sorry byproduct of Americas status as the  worlds leading jailer .         The typical American family if it ever lived anywhere but on  Norman Rockwells Thanksgiving canvas  has become as multilayered and full of surprises as a holiday turducken  the all-American seasonal portmanteau of deboned turkey duck and chicken.         Researchers who study the structure and evolution of the American family express unsullied astonishment at how rapidly the family has changed in recent years the transformations often exceeding or capsizing those same experts predictions of just a few journal articles ago.         This churning this turnover in our intimate partnerships is creating complex families on a scale weve not seen before said  Andrew J. Cherlin  a professor of public policy at Johns Hopkins University. Its a mistake to think this is the endpoint of enormous change. We are still very much in the midst of it.         Yet for all the restless shape-shifting of the American family researchers who comb through census survey and historical data and conduct field studies of ordinary home life have identified a number of key emerging themes.         Families they say are becoming more socially egalitarian over all even as economic disparities widen. Families are more ethnically racially religiously and stylistically diverse than half a generation ago  than even half a year ago.         In increasing numbers blacks marry whites atheists marry Baptists men marry men and women women Democrats marry Republicans and start talk shows. Good friends join forces as part of the voluntary kin movement sharing medical directives wills even adopting one another legally.         Single people live alone and proudly consider themselves families of one  more generous and civic-minded than so-called greedy marrieds.         There are really good studies showing that single people are more likely than married couples to be in touch with friends neighbors siblings and parents said  Bella DePaulo  author of Singled Out and a visiting professor of psychology at the University of California Santa Barbara.         But that doesnt mean theyll be single forever. There are not just more types of families and living arrangements than there used to be said  Stephanie Coontz  author of the coming book Intimate Revolutions and a social historian at Evergreen State College in Olympia Wash. Most people will move through several different types over the course of their lives.         At the same time the old-fashioned family plan of stably married parents residing with their children remains a source of considerable power in America  but one that is increasingly seen as out of reach to all but the educated elite.         Were seeing a class divide not only between the haves and the have-nots but between the I dos and the I do nots Dr. Coontz said. Those who are enjoying the perks of a good marriage wouldnt stand for any other kind she said while those who would benefit most from marital stability are the ones least likely to have the resources to sustain it.         Yet across the divide runs a white picket fence our unshakable star-spangled belief in the value of marriage and family. We marry divorce and remarry at rates not seen anywhere else in the developed world. We lavish  $70 billion a year on weddings  more than we spend on  pets  coffee toothpaste and toilet paper combined.         Were sappy family romantics. When an informal sample of 52 Americans of different ages professions and hometowns were asked the first thought that came to mind on hearing the word family the answers varied hardly at all. Love! Kids! Mom! Dinner!         Its the backbone of how we live said David Anderson 52 an insurance claims adjuster from Chicago. It means everything said Linda McAdam 28 who is in human resources on Long Island.         Yes everything and sometimes too many things. Its almost like a weight said Rob Fee 26 a financial analyst in San Francisco a heavy weight. Or as the comedian George Burns said Happiness is having a large loving caring close-knit family in another city.         In charting the differences between todays families and those of the past demographers start with the kids  or rather the lack of them.         The nations birthrate today is  half what it was in 1960  and last year hit  its lowest point ever . At the end of the baby boom in 1964 36 percent of all Americans were under 18 years old; last year children  accounted for just 23.5 percent of the population  and the proportion is dropping to a projected 21 percent by 2050. Fewer women are becoming mothers  about 80 percent of those of childbearing age today versus 90 percent in the 1970s  and those who reproduce do so more sparingly averaging two children apiece now compared with three in the 1970s.         One big reason is the soaring cost of ushering offspring to functional independence. According to the Department of Agriculture the average middle-class couple will spend  $241080  to raise a child to age 18. Factor in four years of college and maybe graduate school or a parentally subsidized internship with the local theater company and say hello to your million-dollar bundle of oh joy.         As steep as the fertility decline has been the marriage rate has fallen more sharply particularly among young women who do most of the nations childbearing. As a result 41 percent of babies are now born out of wedlock a fourfold increase since 1970.         The trend is not demographically uniform instead tracking the nations widening gap in income and opportunity. Among women with a bachelors degrees or higher 90 percent adhere to the old playground song and put marriage before a baby carriage. For everybody else maternity is often decoupled from matrimony: 40 percent of women with some college but no degree and 57 percent of women with high school diplomas or less are unmarried when they give birth to their first child.         More than one-quarter of these unwed mothers are living with a partner who may or may not be their childs biological father. The rise of the cohabiting couple is another striking feature of the evolving American family: From 1996 to 2012 the number jumped almost 170 percent to 7.8 million from 2.9 million.         Nor are unmarried mothers typically in their teens; contrary to all the talk of an epidemic of teenage motherhood the birthrate among adolescent girls has dropped by nearly half since 1991 and last year hit an all-time low a public health triumph that experts attribute to better sex education and birth-control methods. Most unmarried mothers today demographers say are in their 20s and early 30s.         Also dÃ©modÃ© is the old debate over whether mothers of dependent children should work outside the home. The facts have voted the issue is settled and Paycheck Mommy is now a central organizing principle of the modern American family.         The share of mothers employed full or part time has quadrupled since the 1950s and today accounts for nearly three-quarters of women with children at home. The number of women who are their families sole or primary breadwinner also has soared to 40 percent today from 11 percent in 1960.         Yes I wear the pants in the family said Ana Perez 35 a mother of three and a vice president at a financial services company in New York who was indeed wearing pants. I can say it brings me joy to know I can take care of my family.         Cultural attitudes are adapting accordingly. Sixty-two percent of the public and 72 percent of adults under 30  view the ideal marriage  as one in which husband and wife both work and share child care and household duties; back when Jimmy Carter was president less than half of the population approved of the dual-income family and less than half of 1 percent of husbands knew how to operate a sponge mop.         Mothers are bringing home more of the bacon and of the mortarboards too. While most couples are an even match scholastically 28 percent of married women are better educated than their mates; that is true of just 19 percent of married men. Forty years ago the asymmetry went the other way.         Some experts argue that the growing legion of mothers with advanced degrees has helped sharpen the already brutal competition for admission to the nations elite universities which stress the importance of extracurricular activities. Nothing predicts the breadth and busyness of a childs after-school schedule better it turns out than the mothers level of education.         One change that caught many family researchers by surprise was the recent dip in the divorce rate. After many decades of upward march followed by a long stubborn stay at the familiar 50 percent mark that made every nuptial feel like a coin flip the rate began falling in 1996 and is now just above 40 percent for first-time marriages.         The decline has been even more striking among middle- and upper-middle-income couples with college degrees. For them fewer than one in three marriages is expected to end in divorce a degree of stability that allows elite couples to merge their resources with confidence maximally invest in their children and otherwise widen the gap between themselves and the struggling masses.         There are exceptions of course. Among baby boomers the rate of marriage failure has surged 50 percent in the past 20 years  perhaps out of an irritable nostalgia researchers said for the days of free love better love anything but this love. Nor do divorce rates appear to have fallen among those who take the old Samuel Johnson quip as a prescription allowing hope to triumph over experience and marrying again and again.         For both Mike and Kristi Burns now in their 40s the first marriage came young and left early and the second stuck around for more than a dozen years.         Kristi was 19 living in South Carolina and her Marine boyfriend was about to be shipped to Japan. I wasnt attached to him really she said but for some reason I felt this might be my only chance at marriage.         In Japan Kristi gave birth to her son Brandon realized she was lonely and miserable and left the marriage seven weeks after their first anniversary. Back in the States Kristi studied to be a travel agent moved to Michigan and married her second husband at age 23.         He was an electrician. He adopted Brandon and the couple had a son Griffin. The marriage lasted 13 years.         We were really great friends but we werent a great husband and wife Kristi said. Our parenting styles were too different.         Besides she went on he didnt verbalize a lot but he was mad a lot and I was tired of walking around on eggshells.         After the divorce friends persuaded her to try the online dating service  match.com  and just as her free trial week was about to expire she noticed a new profile in the mix.         Kristi was one of the first people to ping me said Mike Burns an engineer for an e-commerce company. This was at 3 in the morning.         They started chatting. Mike told Kristi how hed married his first wife while he was still in college  definitely too young he said  and divorced her two years later. He met his second wife through mutual friends they had a big church wedding started a software publishing company together sold it and had two children Brianna and Alec.         When the marriage started going downhill Mike ignored signs of trouble like the comments from neighbors who noticed his wife was never around on weekends.         I was delusional I was depressed he said. I still had the attitude that divorce wasnt something you did.         After 15 years of marriage his wife did it for him and kicked him out of the house. His divorce papers hadnt yet been finalized he told Kristi that first chat night. Ill help you get through it she replied.         Mike and Kristi admit their own three-year-old marriage isnt perfect. The kids are still adjusting to one another. Sometimes Kristi a homemaker feels jealous of how much attention her husband showers on his daughter Brianna 13. Sometimes Mike retreats into his computer. Yet they are determined to stay together.         I know everyone thinks this marriage is a joke and people expect it to fail said Kristi . But that just makes me work harder at it.         Id say our chances of success are better than average her husband added.         In America family is at once about home and the next great frontier.         LOS ANGELES  The Schulte-Wayser family is like the Jetsons: a blend of midcentury traditional and postmodern cool.         One parent is the breadwinner a corporate lawyer who is Type A when it comes to schoolwork bedtime and the importance of rules. The other parent is the self-described baby whisperer staying home to care for the couples two daughters and four sons who dash through their days as if wearing jetpacks.         Both parents know when rules and roles are made for subverting. We are each of us very maternal in our own way said Joshua Wayser 50 the lawyer. I take my girls shopping and Im in charge of beauty and hair care. Mr. Wayser glanced at Richard Schulte 61 his homemaker-artist husband who was sitting nearby.         Of course Mr. Wayser added dryly he doesnt think I do a good job.         Mr. Wayser Mr. Schulte and their six adopted children are part of one of the more emphatic reinventions of the standard family flow chart. A growing number of gay men and lesbians are pursuing parenthood any way they can: adoption surrogacy donor sperm.         Theres a gayby boom thats for sure Mr. Wayser said. So many of our friends are having kids.         Some critics have expressed concern that the children of gay parents may suffer from social stigma and the lack of conventional adult role models or that same-sex couples are not suited to the monotonous rigors of family life. Earlier studies often invoked in the culture wars over same-sex marriage suggested that children who lived with gay parents were prone to lower grades conduct disorders and a heightened risk of drug and alcohol problems.         But new research suggests that such fears are misplaced. Through a preliminary analysis of census data and other sources  Michael J. Rosenfeld  of Stanford University has  found  that whatever problems their children may display are more likely to stem from other factors like the rupture of the heterosexual marriage that produced the children in the first place.         Once these factors are taken into account said Dr. Rosenfeld author of  The Age of Independence: Interracial Unions Same-sex Unions and the Changing American Family  the children of same-sex parents are academically and emotionally indistinguishable from those of heterosexual parents.         And two-father couples in defiance of stereotype turn out to be exemplars of domesticity. In her long-term studies of unconventional families  Judith Stacey  a professor of social and cultural analysis at New York University found that the most stable of all were those headed by gay men whod had their children together.         Over 14 years she said I was shocked to find that none of the male couples with children had broken up not one. Dr. Stacey author of  Unhitched: Love Marriage and Family Values From West Hollywood to Western China  attributed that success to self-selection. For men to become parents without women is very difficult she said. Only a small percentage are willing and able to make the commitment.         Theres no maybe about the gayby boom. According to the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles the number of  gay couples with children has doubled  in the past decade and today  well over 100000 same-sex couples are raising children . Other  estimates  put the number of children living with gay parents  couples and singletons combined  at close to two million or one out of 37 children under age 18.         Driving the rise in same-sex parenthood is the resonant success of the marriage equality movement which has led to the  legalization of same-sex marriage in 16 states  and has helped ease adoption policies elsewhere. In 2009 19 percent of same-sex couples raising children  reported  having an adopted child up from just 10 percent in 2000. Gay parents are four times as likely as straight ones to be raising adoptees and six times as likely to be caring for foster children whom they  often end up adopting .         Some crave the fetters of DNA and here women have an advantage. Many of the children of lesbian couples are the biological offspring of one of the women and a semen donor  who may be anonymous a friend the brother of the nongestating woman or  Mark Ruffalo .         The Schulte-Wayser family started out unhyphenated as the Waysers. The two men had broken up; Mr. Wayser was living alone in Los Angeles his law career was in flux and he was tired of obsessing about work. I thought Ive got to do something elseÂ  he said. I had to come out to myself as a father.         His mother was thrilled and she offered to pay the costs for a surrogate mother to carry a baby conceived with his sperm. Mr. Wayser said no.         I wanted the clarity of having someone who didnt share my genetics who was completely different from me he said.         He met with an adoption lawyer in March 2000 and by June he had a newborn daughter Julie. Several months later Mr. Schulte called to chat heard Julie in the background and stopped by to meet her.         The baby reminded him of Don King the boxing promoter. It was love at first sight Mr. Schulte said and Mr. Wayser acknowledged I used Julie as bait.         His old boyfriend took it. We were a couple again Mr. Schulte said. Or rather he amended we were a family. He and Mr. Wayser later married in Malibu.         From 2002 to 2009 four brothers and a sister followed  Derek A J Isaac (all from one mother) Shayna and Joey. Thats my line in the sand Mr. Wayser said. Weve run out of room.         Yet he believes its easier to manage a large family than a small one. They entertain each other. They organize themselves he said. We send the kids out. We say Go ride your bike go out and play. We want them to have a very traditional childhood in a nontraditional setting.         He admits to being a worrier. Some of the children have learning disabilities and require extensive tutoring and he doesnt know what risks the birth mothers might have taken during pregnancy.         But he resents people who note the color of his childrens skin as well as his obvious financial resources and cluck about how noble he is and how lucky the children are.         No Im the one whos lucky here he said. Im not trying to save the world.         Ana Perez 35 who moved to New York from the Dominican Republic at age 5 has an open smile a firm handshake and a vivid scrappy manner just this side of a fireplug. But as she recalled the night she threw the father of her two older children out of her Harlem apartment her voice cracked into a dozen pieces and her eyes blurred with tears.         She might have accepted his infidelities if hed kept them discreet cheap and away from the neighborhood. I had this mentality that men will be men. she said.         But when he began lavishly dating the younger sister of a friend of hers Ms. Perez confronted him in a fury.         I said Youve been spending money on this person when you have children who need diapers and milk?Â  she said. The last straw was we had this huge fight in the kitchen and I pulled a knife on him. For a second I saw my children without a mother  because I would be in jail.         Their relationship ended that night a decade ago she said and I never looked back.         He still visits with George 16 and Bryana 10 as a friend figure Ms. Perez said but he has no say in their upbringing.         For the past six years Ms. Perez has lived with Julian Hill 39 the father of her third child Bubba 4. Mr. Hill is tall and African-American his head shaved his cream-colored suit impeccably paired with a blue-checked bankers shirt and yellow tie. He is devoted to all three children and involved in their everyday lives.         I come home every night he said. They might be asleep when I get home but Im here every night. Im always pushing them hard to do their very best maybe sometimes a little too hard.         Until this fall Ms. Perez worked for a financial services firm and she has been the familys primary earner. Mr. Hill equally ambitious has worked as a notary public mortgage closer and occasional stock investor. He and Ms. Perez recently started a small notary-mortgage business.         I think like Warren Buffett Mr. Hill said. My plan is to be a billionaire but if I fall short and end up a millionaire that would be fine.         Yet he admits that for now even that downsized goal remains elusive. If youre talking about income he said were lower lower middle class.         If youre talking about their relationship status he and Ms. Perez have been engaged for more than a year and they plan to go more than another year before getting married.         Of the many changes to the design packaging and content of family life over the past generation researchers cite two as especially significant.         One is the sharp increase in out-of-wedlock births among all but the most highly educated women. The second is the repositioning of marriage from cornerstone to capstone from a foundational act of early adulthood to a crowning event of later adulthood  an event that follows such previous achievements as finishing college starting a career and owning furniture not made from fruit crates.         The two trends are interrelated researchers say but for reasons that are often misunderstood. Unmarried parents are not necessarily the careless and shortsighted hedonists of stereotype. Instead a growing number of Americans are simply intimidated by the whole idea of marriage: It has assumed ever greater cultural status becoming the mark of established winners rather than of modestly optimistic beginners (while weddings have become extravagant pageants where doves and butterflies are released but still nobody gets the bridesmaid dresses right).         Childbearing on the other hand happens naturally and offers what marriage all too often does not: lifelong bonds of love.         For many cohabiting couples theres a high bar for marriage high expectations of where they should be at economically or emotionally and if they dont meet that bar theyll put off getting married said  Kelly Musick  an associate professor of policy analysis and management at Cornell University who has studied cohabitation patterns.         But if theyre reasonably pleased with the relationship and happen to find themselves pregnant she continued they may realize theyre not in a great place financially to become parents but theyre still happy to have the child. They find a sense of purpose and fulfillment in parenthood even when the rest of life is withholding the goods.          Kathryn Edin  a professor of public policy and management at Harvard University has interviewed hundreds of low-income Americans. In her latest book  Doing the Best I Can: Fatherhood in the Inner City  which she wrote with her colleague Timothy J. Nelson Dr. Edin describes the enormous instability of family life among the working class and the poor.         In the middle class the divorce rate has gone down and family life is in many ways simpler than it used to be she said in an interview. Theres far more complexity and churning of households among the poor a turnover of partnerships lots of half-siblings.         Yet Dr. Edin also punctures the myth of the low-income father as a deadbeat who deposits his sperm and runs. Instead the young men in her study were eager to establish their paternity.         Theyre showing up at the hospital and signing birth certificates in droves she said. Theyre doing all this voluntarily even though they know that by having their name on the certificate theyll be liable for child support and could go to jail if they dont pay.         The fathers also proved to be more involved in their childrens lives than previously believed. Even five years in about two-thirds of fathers are seeing their kids at least monthly and just under half are seeing their kids several times a week Dr. Edin said.         Most of Ms. Perezs previous co-workers were younger than she was and came from middle-class backgrounds and she acknowledges that their timing of life events has its benefits.         You go to college you build your finances you marry you build more finances then you have children she said. If you wait longer you have the foundation youre more educated and you have the confidence in yourself that youre able to survive.         Then again she laughed in Spanish culture we do everything early.         She is convinced that having her first child at 19 was the right thing to do. Without that incentive I would have had such a different life she said. I would have been much less productive. I would have spent all my time just hanging out.         But between the spur of her familys needs and a work ethic she describes as awesome Ms. Perez rose to a vice presidency at her previous company and I didnt even graduate high school she said.         Nevertheless she frets incessantly about the future. Shed like to go back to school and set something aside for her childrens college educations; she wont buy cereal thats not on sale; and the last thing she wants to spend money on right now is a wedding.         Im O.K. just going to City Hall she said.         Mr. Hill wont hear of it. I cant do that I cant just go downtown he said. I want to do something big a wedding with friends and family standing together.         So hell wait until hes saved enough to pay for the wedding of his dreams when he can celebrate the family he loves and know it has arrived.         ATLANTA  When people first meet Dr. Indran Indrakrishnan a gastroenterologist with a busy private practice near Atlanta they take note of his unusual name his crisply lilting accent his tan complexion and wavy black hair and they ask So doctor where are you from?         See if you can guess Dr. Indrakrishnan replies cheerfully. India? No. Pakistan? No. Iran Egypt Turkey Afghanistan? Negatives all around.         At that point theyre stumped and they move on to South America he said and when I finally tell them I was born in Sri Lanka they look more confused than ever. Sri Lanka? Where is that?Â          Such casual geographic illiteracy may soon give way under the sheer force of numbers. Dr. Indrakrishnan is part of a new tide of immigration that has been sweeping America upending old voting blocs reconfiguring neighborhoods diversifying local restaurant options and casting a fresh perspective on the meaning of traditional family values.         Though much of the immigration debate has focused on Latinos the fastest-growing immigrant groups  are not Hispanic but Asian . The Asian-American population soared by 46 percent from 2000 to 2010 compared with  43 percent for Hispanics  and  1 percent for non-Hispanic whites  and the  Asian share of new immigrants nearly doubled  to 36 percent from 19 percent.         The 1950s stereotype of the ideal American family of Dick Jane and Wonder Bread homogeneity arose at a time when the immigration rate was near historic lows. Today the best place to find a traditional G-rated American family may be in an immigrant community. Asian-American families in particular are exceptionally stable.  They are half as likely to be divorced as Americans in general ; only 16 percent of Asian-American infants are born out of wedlock compared with 41 percent over all; and 80 percent of Asian-American children are raised by two married parents versus 63 percent over all according to Pew Research data.         Many of the new Asian immigrants come from solidly middle-class backgrounds and many though by no means all do as well or better after moving to the United States. Fifty-one percent hold college degrees compared with 31 percent of all adults. According to recent studies Asian-Americans have the highest average household income of any racial group roughly $68000 a year compared with $55000 for whites and $34000 for African-Americans.         At the front edge of the Asian-American boom are immigrants from South Asia including India Pakistan and Sri Lanka.         Dr. Indrakrishnan 53 who also teaches at the Emory University School of Medicine is something of a celebrity among South Asian immigrants  the sociable civic-minded and highly successful professional everyone wants to schmooze with at the local Hindu temple each week.         Sometimes I have to go to temple during off hours he said or Ill get caught up chatting there the entire day.         He lives with his wife Gayathri 49 a tax accountant and their daughter Harini a high school senior in a gated enclave on the banks of a glistening artificial lake not far from the former residence of the football quarterback Michael Vick. The house feels like a castle only bigger  15000 square feet of vaulted chandeliered ceilings an enormous alabaster fireplace matching ornate staircases that curve together like an upside-down heart and an elevator if youre too tired for the stairs.         Personal statements can be found throughout: in one corner an elegant bronze sculpture of the Hindu deity  Shiva ; in another a bulbous-bodied stringed instrument called a Saraswati  vina  that Gayathri Indrakrishnan wishes she had more time to play; and in the basement a custom-built studio where Harini practices Bharatanatyam a highly structured almost geometric form of classical Indian dance that has become a defining feature of her otherwise all-American life.         Dance keeps me connected to my culture she said. Ive got the best of both worlds.         Her parents grew up in the same part of Sri Lanka and had friends a  family doctor  and a cleaning woman in common. But the two didnt really meet until they were young adults living in North America  he finishing his medical training she pursuing microbiology  and their older brothers decided to play matchmakers.         He flew to Toronto for a rendezvous. If it wasnt exactly love at first sight she said the chemistry was there. The couple spent a year exchanging phone calls and letters and were married in 1991.         We had whats called a semi-arranged marriage Dr. Indrakrishnan said. Its quite common back in India and Sri Lanka. Families are involved but they dont push; we had to like each other and get along.         After they married and settled in the United States Ms. Indrakrishnan traded microbiology for an M.B.A. and a numbers-crunching career. She and her husband became American citizens a decade ago.         I love living here! he said. It is truly the land of opportunities. Yet he said he would not have wanted to marry an American woman and when asked the first word that came to mind on hearing the word family he said Gayathri my wife.         The Census Bureau does not track the frequency of arranged marriages but researchers believe the numbers are rising. Among other signs they said is the growing number of immigrant matchmaking websites like  bharatmatrimony.com  aimed not just at eager singletons but at their parents and relatives.         And though many Americans may bridle at the idea studies suggest there is little downside to letting the family do your advance work. Kathryn Klement a doctoral candidate in psychology at Northern Illinois University surveyed 329 married Indian women 176 of them in arranged marriages and said I didnt find any significant differences between the two groups in marital happiness feelings of intimacy trust and commitment sexual satisfaction and the ease with which the women could express their desires.         Indran and Gayathri Indrakrishnan independently identified the same key to long-lasting marital harmony. Its tolerance she said. Many of Dr. Indrakrishnans American patients are not very tolerant of their spouses he said. They want the chemistry to be perfect and if it isnt pfft they split up.         Tolerance extends to their parenting style. Their expectations for Harini are quite high but they care less whether she aces every class than that she is always trying always seeking to improve.         If there is homework due or a test the next day and shes goofing off and not listening to me yes Ill be upset her mother said. Harini it seems has absorbed the parental credo. When she sensed that Facebook was interfering with her schoolwork she deactivated her account.         Also poised for deactivation is a certain clichÃ© symbolized by fangs and stripes.         It is no secret that many Asian-American students excel academically; their average SAT scores for example are the  highest of any ethnic group .         One theory to gain traction lately is that Asian-American parents are harsh taskmasters who virtually chain their children to their desks and pianos a view reinforced by Amy Chua in her best-selling book  Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.   But a long-term study of 300 Chinese-American families suggests that view is nothing but a stereotype. The researchers led by  Su Yeong Kim  an associate professor of human development and family sciences at the University of Texas at Austin administered lengthy questionnaires to parents and children asking about school work home life grades extracurricular activities and emotions. The researchers determined that the parents most likely to raise high-achieving offspring were not cold authoritarians but ones who combined the right amount of parental control with a high level of warmth Dr. Kim said.         Supportive parenting always yields the best outcome academically and socio-emotionally too she added. These kids outperform the kids of tiger parents by quite a lot.         She and her colleagues proposed other factors that might help explain the good report cards: family pride; cultural traditions that extol education like  Confucianism ; and childrens acute awareness of parental sacrifice.         They gave up everything for their kids as Dr. Kim characterized this attitude so Id better not blow it. And when they succeed they bring honor to ancestors descendants the entire high-fiving clan.         LOS ANGELES  Jan Glusac 51 is blond and heigh-ho friendly a first-grade teacher with a first-rate tolerance for contradictory ideas. A few years ago she and her family participated in a landmark study by researchers from the University of California Los Angeles  a close anthropological look at the daily lives of 32 typical middle-class American families.         Does she feel that her family is in fact typical?         I do and I dont Ms. Glusac says.         She wears a long white skirt black blouse jeans jacket and a silver necklace and is sitting on a plump aubergine couch in a comfortable recently renovated postwar bungalow in Westchester a solidly middle-class neighborhood not far from the Los Angeles airport.         On the typical side of the ledger: The average middle-class family has two children and seated next to Ms. Glusac are her two children Katie and Chris.         Katie 17 is a high school senior a star of her cross-country and soccer teams an intern at a local veterinary clinic and these days a captive player in that all-American combat sport called applying to college. Chris 21 is a Santa Monica College engineering student who still lives at home but plans to transfer next year to the University of California Santa Barbara.         We may soon be empty nesters Ms. Glusac says. Thats one phase of life were not ready for.         But at least theyll still have Ollie she says  the best dog ever! Katie chimes in  and dogs it so happens are the most popular pet in America  preferred over cats  by more than two to one.         Around 6 p.m. Srdan Glusac 50 arrives home from his job as an avionics engineer at Federal Express. Mr. Glusac who goes by the nickname Serg (pronounced surge) was born in Sarajevo Bosnia but grew up in Montreal. He looks like the original from which Chris was cloned: the same mild face the same fine sandy hair.         Mr. Glusac generally gets home an hour or two after his wife a scheduling disparity common among two-career households: American men spend 35 to 55 minutes  longer on the job  each day than women do while working mothers devote eight more hours a week to child care and housekeeping  compared with working fathers .         Less typical is Mr. Glusacs Bosnian mother Ilinka Volk who lives nearby and has long acted as the fantasy super-grandma obviating the need for day care chauffeuring the kids to soccer games and serving up Old World comfort food like stuffed cabbage goulash and a revelatory Bosnian custard called snow clouds.         Jan Glusac points out that her family is better off than most with a household income nearly four times the  national median of about $51000 . For example Chris recently bought a black BMW convertible which meant Katie got his Prius.         And now were a four-car family Chris says sheepishly. That sounds pretty bad doesnt it? The average number of cars per American family is 2.28.         The family has had its share of frame shifts and body blows. Ms. Glusac was treated for  breast cancer  eight years ago. In middle school Chris became extremely introverted and barely left his room. I feel like Im a key in the wrong lock he confessed in a note to his parents.         That made me start crying Ms. Glusac says. I knew exactly what he meant.         As a ninth grader Katie was arrested after shoplifting more than $100 worth of clothing from a department store. Her parents were devastated. She was grounded for the summer and had to perform community service help pay her legal fees by handing over most of the money shed saved since elementary school and endure the humiliation of hearing her mother tell other parents that if they didnt want their children associating with Katie shed understand.         That was the hardest part the strain on my relationship with my parents Katie says. But what came out of it was a stronger relationship than before  and lucky for her no permanent record.         In the U.C.L.A. study a team of researchers associated with the  Center on Everyday Lives of Families  focused on dual-income families with two or more school-age children at home in the Los Angeles area. The investigators spent weeks with each family staying in the background as they observed and recorded every aspect of home life: the banter the spats the struggles over homework and piano practice the laundry the meals.         As recounted in the books  Fast-Forward Family  and  Life at Home in the 21st Century  the scientists learned that American families are just this side of clinically compulsive hoarders owning more material goods per household than any society in history in the words of one investigator  Jeanne E. Arnold  a professor of anthropology.         The researchers also particularized the centrality of the kitchen where the largest and most visible clocks are displayed and where the greatest number of calendars school memos and to-do lists are posted.         Yet the lure of a festively pushpinned corkboard has its limits. The researchers determined that even when all of the family members were at home and awake together they were in the same room only 14 percent of the time.         The researchers have since done comparative studies of families in Italy Sweden Samoa and the Peruvian Amazon and have concluded that American families are outliers in their fixation on childrens needs and childrens success.         In other societies school-aged children are expected to be vigilant and see what needs to be done around the house and they routinely do chores without being asked said  Elinor Ochs  a director of the study. But here in middle-class mainstream households you cant ask kids to do anything. Its incredible.         Instead given todays single-digit admission rates at the nations elite universities middle-class American parents want their children to focus almost exclusively on homework and extracurricular activities. In a study of the after-school life of students in the Philadelphia area  Annette Lareau  of the University of Pennsylvania and her colleagues found that virtually all the middle-class children remained as tightly scripted outside the classroom as they had been during the school day.         At one suburban school she said I went through the schedules of 100 fourth graders and couldnt find a single child who did not have any organized activities. The researchers also determined that the time children spent in such activities rose in tandem with the mothers education: 4 hours 54 minutes per week for the children of mothers with some college 5 hours 37 minutes for the offspring of college graduates and 6 hours 33 minutes for the children of mothers with graduate degrees.         I remember feeling like that was all I ever did  I was always in the car driving someone someplace Jan Glusac says of her familys two-car days. I dont think I could keep that schedule up at this point in my life she adds. Nowadays the kids largely take care of themselves Ms. Glusac says and theyre either out of the house or working in their rooms. We love being together as a family she says even if that means little more than sharing the same roof.         The American family began life in the raggedness of the Colonial era as a kind of organizational Swiss Army knife  many institutions in one convenient package.         The home was a place of business of relentless industry where there was always more flax to spin and tallow to drip; all able-bodied family members from toddlerhood onward were expected to work for the family economy. (In fact the word family comes from the Latin for servant.)         The home was a delivery ward schoolroom hospital and funeral parlor. And in an age before centralized government or even a reliable town sheriff the home served as the primary locus of social control. Everyone had to reside in the all-encompassing embrace of a bustling household and adults who tried to live alone particularly single men were viewed with suspicion advised to marry find room and board with a decent family or get out of town.         As recently as the 1950s according to  Andrew J. Cherlin  a professor of public policy at Johns Hopkins University unattached adults could arouse community ire. If you didnt get married by a certain point there had to be something wrong with you he said. People suspected you were mentally ill.         Yet as a young nation of wide horizons and Powerball opportunities America also encouraged a degree of footlooseness a scorn for the settled and a yen for the new. That novelty-seeking spirit applied as much to conjugal matters as economic ones and the divorce rate rose steadily along with the number of stars on the flag. By the turn of the 20th century the United States had the highest divorce rate in the Western world a title it retains to this day.         Its the great American paradox. We value marriage as the center of civilized society Dr. Cherlin said. At the same time we value our liberty the pursuit of personal happiness and the right to leave a bad marriage behind.         Other factors helped give the American family its distinctive cast. As the population shifted westward and the distances between dwellings opened Americans grew accustomed to a degree of privacy and personal space that few other earthlings could share.         The passion for privacy accelerated as the Industrial Revolution pulled productive activity out of the house and into the factory leaving the home as a private sanctum for the family. Americans went wild for the privatized family and family-themed activities: the family vacation kiddie birthday parties decorating the Christmas tree and the ultimate American family holiday Thanksgiving signed into law by the man who saved the Union Abraham Lincoln.         And over the river and through the woods notwithstanding that family mostly meant nuclear with ties to older or second-order relatives increasingly frayed.         Industrialization and the entry of women into the work force changed the nature of marriage as well from the pragmatic merging of skill sets that prevailed in the agricultural era to a relationship of choice based on friendship personal compatibility and love.         Marriage as an institution lost much of its power over our lives but marriage as a relationship became more powerful than ever said the social historian  Stephanie Coontz .         The trend has only intensified with time. The less we need marriage she said the more we expect from it.         One variant of the modern American family  sadly characteristic if often ignored  is the family struggling with the impact of an incarcerated parent. Largely as a result of harsh drug laws and mandatory minimum sentences the  nations prison population has almost quadrupled  over the past 30 years according to a 2010 Pew Charitable Trusts study.         Today the United States is the worlds leading jailer by far housing more of its citizens behind bars  than the top 35 European countries combined . And of the estimated 2.3 million inmates serving time more than half are parents of children under age 18. That translates into 2.7 million affected children nationwide or one of every 28 up from one in 125 in 1990.         Some groups have been hit much harder than others. African-American children living in lower-income 
14,100000002575138,1,Article,News,U.S.,us,politics,"Inside the Race to Rescue a Health Care Site, and Obama",SHERYL GAY STOLBERG;MICHAEL D. SHEAR,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/us/politics/inside-the-race-to-rescue-a-health-site-and-obama.html,1,WASHINGTON  As a small coterie of grim-faced advisers shuffled into the Oval Office on the evening of Oct. 15 President Obamas chief domestic accomplishment was falling apart 24 miles away at a bustling high-tech data center in suburban Virginia.         HealthCare.gov the $630 million online insurance marketplace was a disaster after it went live on Oct. 1 with a roster of engineering repairs that would eventually swell to more than 600 items. The private contractors who built it were pointing fingers at one another. And inside the White House after initially saying too much traffic was to blame Mr. Obamas closest confidants had few good answers.         The political dangers were clear to everyone in the room: Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.;  Kathleen Sebelius  the health secretary; Marilyn Tavenner the Medicare chief; Denis McDonough the chief of staff;  Todd Park  the chief technology officer; and others. For 90 excruciating minutes a furious and frustrated president peppered his team with questions drilling into the arcane minutiae of web design as he struggled to understand the scope of a crisis that suddenly threatened his presidency.         We created this problem we didnt need to create Mr. Obama said according to one adviser who like several interviewed insisted on anonymity to share details of the private session. And its of our own doing and its our most important initiative.         Out of that tense Oval Office meeting grew a frantic effort aimed at rescuing not only the insurance portal and Mr. Obamas credibility but also the Democratic philosophy that an activist government can solve big complex social problems. Today that rescue effort is far from complete.         The website which the administration promised would function smoothly for most people by Nov. 30 remains a work in progress. It is more stable with many more people able to use it simultaneously than just two weeks ago. But it still suffers sporadic crashes and large parts of the vital back end that processes enrollment data and transactions with insurers remain unbuilt. The president who polls showed was now viewed by a majority of Americans  as not trustworthy  has conceded that he needs to  win back his credibility .         Another round of hardware upgrades and software fixes was planned for Saturday night. Administration officials say they will give a public update about the sites performance on Sunday morning.         The story of how the administration confronted one of the most perilous moments in Mr. Obamas presidency  drawn from documents and from interviews with dozens of administration officials lawmakers insurance executives and tech experts working inside the HealthCare.gov war room  reveals an insular White House that did not initially appreciate the magnitude of its self-inflicted wounds and sought help from trusted insiders as it scrambled to protect Mr. Obamas image.         After a month of bad publicity and intensifying Republican attacks the sense of crisis and damage control inside the White House peaked on Oct. 30 as the presidents top aides began to fully grasp the breadth of the political challenges they faced. As Ms. Sebelius was grilled by Congressional Republicans that day Mr. Obama flew to Boston to defend the health law and confront a  new accusation : that he had lied about whether people could keep their insurance. Meanwhile Mr. McDonough huddled at the Democratic National Committee headquarters with a small group of freshman House members whose anxiety was soaring.         The day was a brutal reminder for top White House advisers that fixing the botched health care rollout would be critical to restoring their bosss agenda and legacy. To do that they would have to take charge of a project that they would come to discover had never been fully tested and was flailing in part because of the Medicare agencys decision not to hire a systems integrator that could coordinate its complex parts. The White House would also have to hold together a fragile alliance of Democratic lawmakers and insurance executives.         If we dont do that one senior White House adviser recalled its a very serious threat to the success of the legislation and a very serious threat to him. We get that.         The urgent race to fix the website  now playing out behind the locked glass doors of the closely guarded war room in Columbia Md.  has exposed a deeply dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and Human Services and its technology contractors and tensions between the White House chief of staff and senior health department officials. It strained relations between the Obama administration and the insurance industry helped revive a Republican Party battered after the two-week government shutdown and frustrated even infuriated Congressional Democrats.         But as the presidents team gathered on Oct. 15  with a budget deal finally in sight on Capitol Hill  his difficulties were only just becoming clear to the White House. As aides left the Oval Office that evening clutching notes filled with what Mr. McDonough called do-outs or assignments political pressure was mounting.        
15,100000002567547,1,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,"Chilling Look at Newtown Killer, but No ‘Why’",JOSEPH BERGER;MARC SANTORA,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/nyregion/sandy-hook-shooting-investigation-ends-with-motive-still-unknown.html,1,NEWTOWN Conn.  Adam Lanza spent the final months of his life mostly alone in his bedroom. His windows were covered with black trash bags. He was preoccupied with violent video games and created a spreadsheet of some of the worst massacres in American history.         Mr. Lanza refused to speak even to his mother communicating with her only by email even though their bedrooms shared the same floor of their house on Yogananda Street.         He would not eat unless his food was arranged in a particular way on his plate. He hated birthdays and holidays and forbade his mother from putting up a Christmas tree.         He also made her get rid of a cat he did not like.         No one else was allowed into his room including his mother who nevertheless did her sons laundry daily because he changed his clothes often.         Among their few outings together were trips to the shooting range. She planned to buy him a gun for Christmas last year.         Mr. Lanza 20 could not connect with people but obsessed over Dance Dance Revolution an interactive video game he played in the lobby of a nearby movie theater spending as long as 10 hours at a time trying to follow dance routines as they flashed on the screen.         Last year four days before her son killed 20 first graders and six adults at  Sandy Hook Elementary School  and then shot himself Ms. Lanza cooked him some of his favorite meals and then left for a three-day trip to New Hampshire.         Ms. Lanza returned on Dec. 13 at 10 p.m.         The next morning her son shot and killed her in her bed.         A  48-page report  released on Monday by the states attorney in Danbury Stephen J. Sedensky III offers a vivid and chilling portrait of the young man responsible for one of the nations worst mass shootings and chronicles his rampage in the school.         But what it does not answer is why.         The long-awaited report does not suggest a motive for Mr. Lanzas actions even as it offers a glimpse into his strange troubled life. It comes nearly a year after the shooting set off a national discussion about gun control mental health and violence in American popular culture.         In that time families of the Sandy Hook Elementary victims have struggled to put their lives back together the town has tried to heal and the school has been razed. But until Monday little information compiled by investigators had been publicly released.         Even basic facts like the path Mr. Lanza took inside the school were kept secret.         After the shooting the Connecticut General Assembly passed bills to limit what could be made public. The state also fought to prevent the release of the recordings of the emergency calls to 911 from people inside the school. At a hearing on Monday before the reports release Judge Eliot Prescott of New Britain Superior Court said that he would review the tapes and soon decide whether to release them.         The report was based on voluminous evidence and interviews conducted by the Connecticut State Police and the states attorneys office along with federal authorities. It marks the end of the investigation.         Investigators struggled to make sense of contradictory descriptions of Mr. Lanza by those who knew him.         The report notes that while significant mental health issues affected his ability to live a normal life and interact with others it remained unclear if they contributed in any way to his actions last December. Mr. Lanza received a diagnosis in 2005 of an autism variant known as Aspergers syndrome but there is no evidence that people with Aspergers are more likely than others to commit violent crimes.         Mr. Lanza was treated by mental health professionals according to the report but none of them saw anything that predicted his future behavior.         Tutoring desensitization and medication were recommended the report said. The shooter refused to take suggested medication and did not engage in suggested behavior therapies.         There were reports of troubling behavior as early as the fifth grade when Mr. Lanza produced The Big Book of Granny for a class project. The main character had a gun in her cane and shot people.         In 2006 as a seventh grader Mr. Lanza was described by a teacher as intelligent but obsessed with violent imagery.        
16,100000002562563,1,Article,News,Fashion & Style,fashion,,What’s He Really Like? Check the Lulu App,DEBORAH SCHOENEMAN,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/fashion/social-networking-App-allows-women-to-rate-men.html,1,Not long ago after Alexandra Amin an assistant at Warner Brothers broke up with an agent she had been dating for a year her friend told her about a new free female-friendly social networking app that lets women anonymously review men who are their Facebook friends.         She was like Hes so crazy you should rate him on LuluÂ  said Ms. Amin 29 who lives in Los Angeles. Ms. Amin gave the ex hashtags including #NeverSleepsOver and #FriendZone. He scored a 6.9 out of 10 which she admitted was lower than he actually deserves.          On Lulu  women can rate men in categories  ex-boyfriend crush together hooked-up friend or relative  with a multiple-choice quiz. Women their gender verified by their Facebook logins add pink hashtags to a mans profile ranging from the good (#KinkyInTheRightWays) to the bad (#NeverSleepsOver) to the ugly (#PornEducated). The hashtags are used to calculate a score generated by Lulu ranging from 1 to 10 that appears under the mans profile picture. (The companys spokeswoman declined to explain the ratings algorithm.) Men can add hashtags which appear in blue but these are not factored into their overall score.         Since it was started last year by Alexandra Chong who has a law degree from the London School of Economics the service has provided a sort of Take Back the Internet moment for young women who have come of age in an era of revenge porn and anonymous possibly ominous suitors. The thing that drew me to Lulu was that dating without a reference is the scariest thing you can do said Erin Foster 31 an actress and writer. Meeting someone out in the world when youre not in school or dont work with each other or have mutual friends  you have no idea what youre getting yourself into.         Ms. Chong 32 a former member of the Jamaica Fed Cup tennis team is now relocating Lulu from London to New York where she said the audience for her app had grown 600 percent in the last six months according to the analytics provider Mixpanel. The trendsetting capital for women is New York and thats where we need to be she said recently.         Sewell Robinson 24 who lives in the East Village and works for an advertising agency estimated that 70 percent of her female friends use Lulu; she has reviewed 10 men on the app some generously. I have written a few reviews to promote guy friends Ms. Robinson said. If a random girl meets them in a bar and is somewhat interested I want them to have a good rep on Lulu.         But she has also panned men in a sisterly spirit. I think sometimes girls feel like they dont have that much power in the hookup world Ms. Robinson said but this gives them something to bond over and you can give advice to a girl youve never met before. Appropriately enough the app was introduced in sororities which representatives of the company continue to visit. Sororities are an established network of girls who are talking about relationships and word spreads very quickly Ms. Chong said. We changed the product a lot with their help. (She said that a quarter of all college women now use Lulu according to Mixpanel.)         Ms. Chong herself never belonged to a sorority; she attended Florida International University on a tennis scholarship and after law school worked for  Upstream  a large mobile marketing firm. She credited her entrepreneurialism in part to her Canadian mother whose family helped start the Calgary Stampede the summer rodeo and her Chinese-Jamaican father who she said was born poor but won a lottery and used the windfall to start a tourism company.         She got the idea for Lulu during a boozy brunch with female friends the day after an awkward Valentines Day setup. We were all sharing stories about guys relationships and sex Ms. Chong said. There were tears and laughter. She concluded that women needed a focused search engine for dating  a Guygle.         When you Google a guy you dont want to know if he voted Republican or what he wrote a paper about in college Ms. Chong said. You want to know if mothers like him. Does he have good manners? Is he sweet?        
17,100000002545656,1,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Bloody End for Iranian Rockers Seeking Musical Freedom in U.S.,VIVIAN YEE;J. DAVID GOODMAN,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/nyregion/4-dead-in-brooklyn-murder-suicide-police-say.html,1,For their music they had risked the wrath of Irans government practicing American-style rock in makeshift soundproof studios and performing it in underground clubs and parking lots despite the threat of fines detention or arrest. Growing up together in Tehran they had found a sound: part punk part garage rock part their own invention.         The Yellow Dogs as the four Iranian musicians were known played in the shadows until 2009 when they appeared in a film about Irans underground music scene that garnered international attention. The next year they left for America finding their way to East Williamsburg Brooklyn where their tidy house became a hub for fellow musicians and Iranians.         Hailed as countercultural heroes in Iran they were a few musicians among many in Brooklyn working day and night to stay afloat playing in basements and lofts until they scored better gigs. And then suddenly in the early hours of Monday morning two of them and another musician were dead shot by another Iranian musician who then killed himself.         While the precise motive was unclear it seemed that money distrust and discord sown amid a tight fraternity of Iranian rock artists were to blame.         If the Yellow Dogs had begun to find success in Brooklyn  they were playing at venues like the Music Hall of Williamsburg and Brooklyn Bowl  the gunman Ali Akbar Mohammadi Rafie had joined his fellow Iranians in Brooklyn only to struggle. Though he had left Iran as part of another band the Free Keys who stayed at the Yellow Dogs house when they arrived in New York in 2011 his relations with both bands had frayed.         While they continued to live in Brooklyn he had moved to Ridgewood Queens less than two miles away. There were accusations that he had stolen money from the Free Keys who forced him to leave the band last year said John J. McCarthy the Police Departments chief spokesman. He was in the United States on a temporary worker visa.         Mr. Rafie tried to rejoin the group only to be rebuffed Mr. McCarthy said. Hes upset that hes not in the band he said.         The outlines provided by the police of the gunmans march through the East Williamsburg townhouse are chilling.         Mr. Rafie climbed to the Yellow Dogs house at 318 Maujer Street across adjacent roofs Mr. McCarthy said. On one investigators found an empty guitar case which they believe was used to transport the assault rifle he used in his attack.         He found his way to a third-floor landing of the home. There he fired once through a window into a living room striking and killing Ali Eskandarian 35 an Iranian-American singer songwriter and writer who had been living in the apartment above the Yellow Dogs.         Mr. Rafie then climbed inside found Arash Farazmand 28 the Yellow Dogs drummer in his bedroom and opened fire fatally shooting him. His brother Soroush Farazmand 27 the bands guitarist was in his second-floor bedroom on his bed and pecking away at his laptop. Mr. Rafie burst in and shot him in the chest killing him.         Shots appeared to have also been fired down a hallway and into a second-floor room striking Sasan Sadeghpourosko 22 another resident in the shoulder and elbow. On the third floor were a man and a woman members of the Coast Guard who had rented a room for Veterans Day events and Pooya Hosseini another Iranian musician from the Free Keys.         Mr. Rafie kicked in the door and he and Mr. Hosseini a former bandmate struggled over the rifle. Several shots went off. Unhurt Mr. Hosseini fled and Mr. Rafie headed to the roof where he shot himself in the head.         Mr. Sadeghpourosko a street artist was treated at Elmhurst Hospital Center and released. His brother who was also in the room was not injured.         The other members of the Yellow Dogs Koory Mirz the bassist and Siavash Karampour the lead singer known as Obash were not there at the time.         Before fleeing for the United States in 2010 the four bandmates belonged to Tehrans small but crazy underground club scene according to a State Department  cable written in 2009  and later released by WikiLeaks.        
18,100000002570520,1,Article,News,World,world,middleeast,Obama Signals a Shift From Military Might to Diplomacy,MARK LANDLER,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/world/middleeast/longer-term-deal-with-iran.html,1,WASHINGTON  The weekend ended with the first tangible sign of a nuclear deal with Iran after more than three decades of hostility. Then on Monday came the announcement that a conference will convene in January to try to broker an end to the civil war in Syria.         The success of either negotiation both long sought by President Obama is hardly assured  in fact the odds may be against them. But the two nearly simultaneous developments were vivid statements that diplomacy the venerable but often-unsatisfying art of compromise has once again become the centerpiece of American foreign policy.         At one level the flurry of diplomatic activity reflects the definitive end of the post-Sept. 11 world dominated by two major wars and a battle against Islamic terrorism that drew the United States into Afghanistan and still keeps its Predator drones flying over Pakistan and Yemen.         But it also reflects a broader scaling-back of the use of American muscle not least in the Middle East as well as a willingness to deal with foreign governments as they are rather than to push for new leaders that better embody American values. Regime change in Iran or even Syria is out; cutting deals with former adversaries is in.         For Mr. Obama the shift to diplomacy fulfills a campaign pledge from 2008 that he would stretch out a hand to Americas enemies and speak to any foreign leader without preconditions. But it will also subject him to considerable political risks as the  protests about the Iran deal  from Capitol Hill and allies in the Middle East attest.         Were testing diplomacy; were not resorting immediately to military conflict Mr. Obama said defending the Iran deal on Monday in San Francisco. Tough talk and bluster may be the easy thing to do politically  he said earlier that day  but its not the right thing for our security.         Still diplomacy is a protracted messy business with often inconclusive results. It is harder for a president to rally the American public behind a multilateral negotiation than a missile strike though the deep war weariness of Americans has reinforced Mr. Obamas instinct for negotiated settlements over unilateral action.         White House officials suggest that the president always planned to arrive at this moment and that everything that came before it  from the troop surge in Afghanistan to the commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden  was cleaning up after his predecessor.         In 2009 we had 180000 troops in two wars and a ton of legacy issues surrounding terrorism said Benjamin J. Rhodes a deputy national security adviser. So much that was done out of the box was winding down those wars. Weve shifted from a very military face on our foreign policy to a very diplomatic face on our foreign policy.         Much of that diplomacy has been on public display in the  hypercaffeinated travels of Secretary of State John Kerry  who in addition to his work on Iran and Syria has persuaded the Israelis and Palestinians to resume peace negotiations. A few hours after sealing the nuclear deal in Geneva he flew to London for talks on the Syria conference.         But some of the crucial dealings have occurred in the shadows. In March administration officials said Mr. Obama authorized a small team of senior officials from the White House and the State Department to travel secretly to Oman the Arab sultanate where they met face to face with Iranian officials to explore the possibility of a nuclear deal.         The cloak-and-dagger was necessary the officials said because it allowed the United States and Iran to discuss the outlines of a nuclear deal without fear that details would leak out. Cutting out others eliminated the competing agendas that come with the six negotiating partners engaged in the formal Geneva talks.         But the disclosure that the United States and Iran had been talking privately angered France which registered its displeasure two weeks ago by warning that the proposal then being discussed was too lenient and that it would not accept a suckers deal.         For all of Mr. Obamas emphasis on diplomacy analysts noted that the United States often depends on others to take the initiative. In the case of Iran it was the election of Hassan Rouhani as president with his mandate to seek a relaxation of punishing sanctions.         In the case of Syria it was a Russian proposal for President Bashar al-Assad to turn over and destroy his chemical weapons stockpiles an option the White House seized on as a way of averting a military strike that Mr. Obama first threatened and then backed off from.        
19,100000002580128,1,Article,News,Health,health,,"As Hospital Prices Soar, a Stitch Tops $500",ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/03/health/as-hospital-costs-soar-single-stitch-tops-500.html,1,SAN FRANCISCO  With blood oozing from deep lacerations the two patients arrived at California Pacific Medical Centers tidy emergency room. Deepika Singh 26 had gashed her knee at a backyard barbecue. Orla Roche a rambunctious toddler on vacation with her family had tumbled from a couch splitting open her forehead on a table.         On a quiet Saturday in May nurses in blue scrubs quickly ushered the two patients into treatment rooms. The wounds were cleaned numbed and mended in under an hour. It was great  they had good DVDs the staff couldnt have been nicer said Emer Duffy Orlas mother.         Then the bills arrived. Ms. Singhs three stitches cost $2229.11. Orlas forehead was sealed with a dab of skin glue for $1696. When I first saw the charge I said What could possibly have cost that much?Â  recalled Ms. Singh. They billed for everything every pill.         In a medical system notorious for opaque finances and inflated bills nothing is more convoluted than hospital pricing economists say. Hospital charges represent about a third of the $2.7 trillion annual United States health care bill the biggest single segment  according to government statistics  and are the largest driver of medical inflation a new study in  The Journal of the American Medical Association  found.         A day spent as an inpatient at an American hospital costs on average more than $4000 five times the charge in many other developed countries according to the  International Federation of Health Plans  a global network of  health insurance  industries. The most expensive hospitals charge more than $12500 a day. And at many of them including California Pacific Medical Center emergency rooms are profit centers. That is why one of the simplest and oldest medical procedures  closing a wound with a needle and thread  typically leads to bills of at least $1500 and often much more.         At Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City Daniel Diaz 29 a public relations executive was billed $3355.96 for five stitches on his finger after cutting himself while peeling an avocado. At a hospital in Jacksonville Fla. Arch Roberts Jr. 56 a former government employee was charged more than $2000 for three stitches after being bitten by a dog. At Mercy Hospital in Port Huron Mich. Chelsea Manning 22 a student received bills for close to $3000 for six stitches after she tripped running up a path. Insurers and patients negotiated lower prices but those charges were a starting point.         The main reason for high hospital costs in the United States economists say is fiscal not medical: Hospitals are the most powerful players in a health care system that has little or no price regulation in the private market.         Rising costs of drugs medical equipment and other services and fees from layers of middlemen play a significant role in escalating hospital bills of course. But just as important is that mergers and consolidation have resulted in a couple of hospital chains  like Partners in Boston or Banner in Phoenix  dominating many parts of the country allowing them to command high prices from insurers and employers.         Sutter Health California Pacific Medical Centers parent company operates more than two dozen community hospitals in Northern California almost all in middle-class or high-income neighborhoods. Its clout has helped California Pacific Medical Center the states largest private nonprofit hospital also earn the highest net income in California. Prices for many of the procedures at the San Francisco hospital are among the top 20 percent in the country according to a New York Times analysis of data released by the federal government.         Sutter is a leader  a pioneer  in figuring out how to amass market power to raise prices and decrease competition said Glenn Melnick a professor of health economics at the University of Southern California. How do hospitals set prices? They set prices to maximize revenue and they raise prices as much as they can  all the research supports that.         In other countries the price of a day in the hospital often includes many basic services. Not here. The chargemaster the price list created by each hospital typically has more than ten thousand entries and almost nothing  even an aspirin a bag of IV fluid or a visit from a physical therapist to help a patient get out of bed  is free. Those lists are usually secret but California requires them to be  filed with health regulators and disclosed .         California Pacific Medical Centers 400-page chargemaster for this year contains some eye-popping figures: from $32901 for an  X-ray  study of the hearts arteries to $25646.88 for gall bladder removal (doctors fees not included) to $5510 for a simple vaginal delivery (not including $731 for each hour of labor or $137 for each bag of IV fluid). Even basic supplies or services carry huge markups: $20 for a codeine pill (50 cents at Rite-Aid or Walgreens) $543 for a breast-pump kit ($25 online) $4495 for a  CT scan  of the abdomen (about $400 at an outpatient facility nearby). Plenty of other hospitals set similar prices.         Dr. Warren Browner the chief executive officer of California Pacific Medical Center said that there were good reasons that hospitals charged what they did: They must have highly trained professionals available 24 hours a day seven days a week. They must constantly upgrade to the latest equipment and building standards to meet patients expectations and state mandates. They charge paying or well-insured patients more to compensate for others they treat at a loss.         Hospital care is extremely expensive to produce and to have available for everyone in the community he said noting that hospitals needed to have a neurosurgeon on call in case a patient turned up with a blood clot on the brain. We take every penny of the revenue we earn and use it to build new and better facilities for everyone in the city.         Some health economists say that even though most hospitals are nonprofit they nonetheless are often flush with revenue and guilty of unnecessary spending.         Hospitals are self-fueling ever-expanding machines said James Robinson an economist and professor of health policy at the University of California Berkeley. There is an infinite amount of stuff to buy  amenities machines new wings higher salaries more nurses.         But he asked to deliver good health care what do you need?          Few Constraints   There is little science to how hospitals determine the prices they print on hospital bills.         Chargemaster prices are basically arbitrary not connected to underlying costs or market prices said Professor Melnick the economist. Hospitals can set them at any level they want. There are no market constraints.         Prices for any item or service are set by each hospital and move up and down yearly and show extraordinary variability health economists say. The codeine that costs $20 and the bag of IV fluid that costs $137 at California Pacific are charged at $1 and $16 at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center across town. But U.C.S.F. Medical Center charges $1600 for an amniocentesis which costs $687 at California Pacific.         After each hospital stay or visit computer programs and human coders and billers use the chargemaster price list to translate the services rendered into a price. Sutter employs more than 1300 people at a special center in Roseville Calif. to perform this and other administrative tasks for its hospitals. Emergency room visits typically include separate charges for doctors services and for supplies as well as a facility fee  the charge for walking in the door.         Orla Roches bill for example included $529 for supplies and devices though her mother is perplexed about what those are: Orla left the emergency room with gauze wrapped round her head (under $1 at Internet supply stores) festooned with a pink cartoon sticker. According to the chargemaster price list for California Pacific a vial of skin glue is billed at $181 a tube of  antibiotic  cream at $125.84 and a vial of local anesthetic at $79.73. These items can be purchased for $15.99 $36.99 and $5 on the Internet though hospitals  which buy wholesale and in bulk  pay far less.         The bill also included $1167 for the facility fee which was classified at Level 3  the middle of the scale though Orlas treatment was one of the most simple emergency room interventions. At Lenox Hill in New York Daniel Diazs unusually detailed bill for his stitches included $1828 for emergency room services $628 for repairing the wound $571.83 for application of a finger splint $97.10 for a  tetanus  shot and $311 for someone to give the injection. At Sparrow Hospital in Lansing Mich. 2-year-old Ben Bellars bill for six stitches more than $2000 included $145.20 for pharmacy  a spoonful of ibuprofen and local anesthetic his mother said.         Economists note that hospitals can bill for emergency room care with relative impunity since injured patients generally rush to the nearest treatment facility. But worried about high prices even the sick sometimes shop around. When Jamie Burke 33 a graduate student in North Carolina came to after she was knocked out during a soccer game in April she started searching on her smartphone for an in-network hospital as a friend drove.         It was crazy she said but luckily I wasnt unconscious so I could figure it out.         She is glad she did: Though the hospital billed $5039 her insurers in-network contracted rate was about $2700. With copays and coinsurance she owed $600 for the visit.         The uninsured are particularly vulnerable to high prices since they have no one to argue on their behalf. When Arch Roberts Jr. got his bill of more than $2000 for stitches he explained that he was uninsured and his business had failed during the housing crisis so he could not afford the fee. The hospital offered him a charity care discount  a price that was still out of range. I dont have $800 to pay them any more than I have $2000 for three stitches he said noting that the hospital has been relentless in its collection efforts.          Paths to Profit   Once perennial money pits emergency rooms have become big moneymakers for most hospitals in the last decade experts say as they raised their fees and managed their patient mix. California Pacific Medical Center has nearly doubled its emergency room fees since 2005 its chargemaster price lists show.         California Pacifics emergency room is not a trauma center; poor or uninsured trauma patients who require lengthy inpatient stays can strain a hospital budget. And insurers allow emergency rooms to bill more than urgent-care centers for simple procedures like stitches or X-raying a sprained ankle making such procedures profitable. Indeed the financial prospects are so appealing that doctors groups in Texas are opening free-standing emergency rooms that are not connected to hospitals.         Hospitals see where theyre making money and try to do more of that said Dr. David Gifford a former health commissioner of Rhode Island who has studied how labs price their tests. He said that laboratory tests and X-rays are priced high and are profitable though there is no difference in quality from national commercial labs that charge far less. A blood count and blood electrolyte test  ordered every day for most inpatients and often in the emergency room  are priced at $259.06 and $293.25 on California Pacific Medical Centers chargemaster price list. Insurers often pay outside labs less than $10 for the services.         And like any business many hospitals try to do fewer services that are not well paid. In 2012 over loud patient protests California Pacific Medical Center outsourced its kidney  dialysis  unit to  DaVita Health Care Partners  a commercial company citing decreasing reimbursement. More than five years ago after Sutter acquired St. Lukes a decrepit hospital in a poor neighborhood it tried to shut the facility and convert it to an outpatient clinic which often generate scans and other expensive tests. (The City of San Francisco rejected the plan.) It did close the hospitals acute psychiatric unit a division that almost always loses money.         You need a Ph.D. in health economics to understand medical pricing said Dr. Browner who has acknowledged that California Pacifics chargemaster prices might appear high. But he added We have to recoup what it costs to keep open what it costs to take care of the un- and underinsured and to rebuild.         He said that MediCal Californias  Medicaid  program pays California Pacific Medical Center only 10 to 20 percent of its actual costs for care.  Medicare  pays about 70 percent he said generally with a predetermined flat fee for each admission based on the patients diagnosis. In contrast many private insurers still pay separately for services rendered based on discounts from the chargemaster prices.         Dr. Browner also pointed to what health care executives call the Saudi sheikh problem at some hospitals.         You dont really want to change your charges if you have a Saudi sheikh come in with a suitcase full of cash whos going to pay full charges he said.         But how much actual charity care does a hospital like California Pacific Medical Center perform? And are insurers and patients paying hospitals for better quality? Or also for amenities like valet parking useless medical gadgetry and inflated salaries?         Though hospitals nonprofit status allows them to reap tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in tax benefits California Pacific Medical Centers main campuses spent 1.27 percent of their more than $1.1 billion in net patient revenues in 2011 on free care for indigent or uninsured patients lower than the state average of 2.07 percent according to  statistics  compiled by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The far smaller St. Lukes branch spent 5.32 percent that year.         Sutter based in Sacramento  employs 28 officials who make more than $1 million a year  and four of them are among the top-paid hospital executives in the state. Sutters chief executive officer makes more than $5 million. In 2011 Dr. Browner 62 a distinguished physician who spent much of his career in academics made more than $1.2 million according to tax documents.         California Pacific Sutters main campus is in upscale Pacific Heights. It has just broken ground on a $2.7 billion renovation which includes a new flagship hospital. Though the project was initiated to meet new state earthquake standards the facility is designed as a sleek glass and marble structure with all private rooms underground parking and roof gardens with flowers and bees to enhance the quality of the healing environment according to California Pacific Medical Centers website. Its Facebook page has called it the coolest hospital in San Francisco possibly the country and even the world.         Consumers may appreciate  or demand  features that contribute to bigger hospital bills. But studies have found no correlation between prices and patient outcomes. A California state rating of hospital services by  the California Health Care Foundation  gave California Pacific Medical Center average scores in most categories though its surgical-care measures were rated superior.         Its crosstown neighbor University of California San Francisco a nationally ranked academic institution charges far less per day than California Pacific when the greater severity of illnesses of its patients is factored in Professor Melnick said. In factÂ a recent study in the publication Annals of Surgery a monthly review of surgical science found that hospitals with the highest complication rates tended to have higher prices.         From such variations economists conclude that costs are highly discretionary noting that hospitals in other developed countries often provide high-quality care with better outcomes in comparatively no-frills environments. Said Dr. Robinson the Berkeley health economist: If you pay hospitals more they spend it. If you pay them less they adjust. The only way to pay less for health care  is to pay less for health care.         Hospital officials like to say that their list prices do not reflect what most patients actually pay because private and government insurers negotiate discounts. Simone Singh a professor of health management and policy at the University of Michigan estimated that insurers generally paid 40 to 50 percent of charges. But with powerful chains like Sutter prices are high and the discounts often are not so generous. Patients are left paying more.          A Price Sequoia   For her three stitches at California Pacific Medical Center Deepika Singh ended up paying $768.56  a lot of money for a 26-year-old retail supply chain manager  of the $1813 rate her insurer negotiated for the approximately $2200 bill. Ms. Duffy owed $1366 after her insurers discount on 2-year-old Orlas $1700 bill since the family had not met its annual deductible. How much is that per minute? she asked.         Across California Sutter hospitals have proved expert at the business of medicine. Our members are very exercised about Sutter  it has increased prices disproportionately said David Lansky chief executive officer of the Pacific Business Group on Health which represents 60 of Californias biggest private employers in its health care negotiations. Sutter has been successful at leveraging their huge size in dictating not just price but contract terms.         Its major competitor is Kaiser a health maintenance organization that runs a closed network of hospitals and doctors. California Pacific Medical Center delivers more than half the babies in San Francisco and is the citys largest employer after Wells Fargo. Sutter contracts also include gag clauses that prevent employers from knowing what rates have been negotiated by their insurers on their behalf Mr. Lansky said.         Chuck Idelson a spokesman for the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy the research arm of the California Nurses Association said Sutter prices were 40 to 70 percent above its rivals for similar services. When Sutter bought Summit Hospital in Oakland in 1999 rates there went up  29 percent to 72 percent  researchers found. Because of pricing issues proposed insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act did not initially include Sutter hospitals.         Terry Miller 62 a businessman in the Bay Area got a bill for $117000 for a two-night stay at California Pacific Medical Center to place a  stent  to open one of his hearts clogged arteries  a charge that did not include fees for the cardiologist and radiologist. According to the Medicare database California Pacific Medical Center charged $43679 for hospitalization to treat a simple  pneumonia  and $96642 to treat a stroke; the Medicare payments for those illnesses were $8046 and $9583.         The high prices have had a ripple effect across Northern California allowing smaller hospitals to charge more as well. Sutter is the tallest Sequoia and everyone goes up just underneath them a bit said Professor Melnick. He noted that hospital prices in California had more than doubled in the past decade after adjustment for inflation.         And payouts in the Pacific region for simple emergency room treatments  stitches a sprained ankle and an  upper respiratory infection   were by far the highest in the country about 50 percent higher than in the Northeast according to an analysis performed for The Times. by the health care consulting firm Truven Health Analytics.          The Merger Factor   In theory health care consolidation can lead to economies of scale but not if it produces complex supersize systems. Excess administrative costs accounted for about $190 billion of the $2.5 trillion medical bill of the United States in 2009 the Institute of Medicine estimated this year  money that could be used for other purposes.         There is a big flurry of consolidation and the effects depend on what the objective of the health care system is said Orry Jacobs of the health care consulting firm BDC Advisors. If the intent is to improve care and bend cost curves then networks can do so. If the objective is to corner the market and demand higher rates then that will happen. Indeed research shows that todays hospital mergers tend to drive up prices.         And employers have limited ability to fight back. Sutter operates the only hospital in some California cities. Beginning on Jan. 1 the University of California Berkeley will exclude Sutters two nearby hospitals from its plan because it could not reach a price agreement. The universitys employees will have to cross the bay or drive inland for in-network hospital treatment or pay more.         As is often the case in American medicine patients will decide if they are willing to pay the high price of care. Back home in New York City Orla Duffys head wound has healed nicely without further treatment. Deepika Singh had her stitches taken out at an urgent care clinic costing $25 with her copay during a business trip to Washington.         Daniel Diaz who had been treated at Lenox Hill Mr. Roberts and Amy Bernstein had no choice but to visit an emergency room this year for stitches. But they all refused to see a doctor for the follow-up.         The amount was outrageous for the time it took to put them in said Ms. Bernstein 54 a real estate lawyer from Long Island who cut herself cleaning knives while fixing a kitchen damaged by  Hurricane Sandy . I was so disgusted I took them out myself.        
20,100000002557161,1,Article,News,Sports,sports,,A Deep-Water Diver From Brooklyn Dies After Trying for a Record,ADAM SKOLNICK,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/sports/deep-water-diver-from-brooklyn-dies-after-trying-for-a-record.html,1,LONG ISLAND Bahamas  As Nicholas Mevoli lay on his back floating in the azure sea attempting to relax his exhales were audible. The countdown had begun and he prepared to dive into Deans Blue Hole hoping to reach 72 meters on a single inhalation with no fins or supplemental oxygen. He began sipping the air attempting to pack as much oxygen in his lungs as possible.         At 12:25 p.m. Sunday surrounded by 15 other athletes and observers as well as five safety divers he turned and submerged face first and looking like a human arrow shooting into the darkness on what would be the last dive of his life.         Officials for Vertical Blue a  championship event  in the sport of free diving monitored and announced Mevolis progress by sonar and all was progressing smoothly until he had trouble at 68 meters or about 223 feet and seemed to turn back. Yet instead of heading to the surface he decided to dive down again in an attempt to reach his goal and achieve his second American record. A few of his fellow athletes squirmed with discomfort recognizing that his decision was a dangerous one.         Diving to that depth with no fins thats a hard physical dive said Mike Board the British record-holder. I was thinking O.K. hes going to have a hard time getting up.         Still Mevoli shot to the surface under his own power after a dive of 3 minutes 38 seconds. Thats when the scene turned nightmarish.         Mevoli ripped off his goggles flashed the O.K. sign and attempted to complete the surface protocol that would make his attempt official by saying I am O.K. But he wasnt. His words were garbled his eyes wide and blank. He tipped backward into the ocean and lost consciousness which while alarming is not unheard-of in a sport in which almost all the top athletes have lost consciousness at one time or another though usually for only a few seconds. Mevoli was not so fortunate.         Five safety divers one of them an Australian paramedic and all certified in life support techniques hefted him onto a nearby platform where the event physician Barbara Jeschke of Germany went to work trying to revive him.         Theres a problem with his lung shouted Marco Cosentino of Italy one of the safety divers who meet the competitors at various stages to help bring them to the surface if they are in distress. They turned Mevoli onto his side and blood began pouring from his mouth and pooling on the platform before dissipating into the sea.         At first there was a pulse at times faint at times strong. Within 15 minutes there was none. The team cut off his wetsuit and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation in earnest. Attempts to revive Mevoli which included three shots of adrenaline at the scene continued unsuccessfully for the next 90 minutes.         Mevoli 32 from Williamsburg Brooklyn was a relative newcomer to the sport. When he dived to 100 meters in May he became the first American to break that barrier unassisted. He used a monofin that day and completed the feat in 3:45. It is this type of free diving  rather than the variety known as variable weight which uses a sled to take divers deeper than they could ever get on their own  that has exploded in popularity in recent years. Internationally free-diving schools are multiplying in destinations as wide-ranging as Hawaii Egypt Indonesia Greece and the Bahamas.         Vertical Blue considered the Wimbledon of free diving is an annual event that attracts the sports top athletes. It is held in a unique arena: Deans Blue Hole a narrow 200-meter-deep limestone pit the deepest of its kind in the world. It is set in a cove backed by cliffs that spill into a turquoise bay. The bay laps the shore of an egg noodle of an island that is 72 miles long home to 4000 people and under the tourism radar.         This year 34 athletes came to compete representing 16 countries with 26 national records set in the first six days of a competition that was scheduled to end on Tuesday. Athletes compete in  three categories : Constant Weight (in which divers dolphin-kick to depth wearing a monofin) Free Immersion (in which athletes pull themselves along a rope down to depth and back to the surface again without wearing fins); and the most difficult event the one that Mevoli attempted Sunday Constant Weight Without Fins (where competitors dive without fins at all).        
21,HCD/KEuUcIEWARm2vzHDkw,1,Blogs,Blog Post,Health,Health,well,Why a Brisk Walk Is Better,GRETCHEN REYNOLDS,,http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/why-a-brisk-walk-is-better/,,Walking fast or slow is wonderful exercise. But now a first-of-its-kind study shows that to get the most health benefits from walking many of us need to pick up the pace. The findings stem from a new analysis of the National Walkers’ Health Study a large database of information maintained at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory about thousands of middle-age men and women who walk regularly for exercise. Recruited beginning in 1998 at walking events and from lists of subscribers to walking-related publications these volunteers filled out a lengthy survey about their typical walking distance and pace as well as their health history and habits. As most of us would likely guess walking is the most popular physical activity in America. But people who walk for exercise do so at wildly varying speeds and intensities. Some stroll at a leisurely 2 miles per hour which is low-intensity exercise. Others zip along at twice that pace or better resulting in a sweatier workout.  Exercise guidelines generally suggest that for health purposes people should engage in 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days of the week. For walkers a moderately intense pace would probably be about 15 or 16 minutes per mile. It has generally been assumed that if people walk more slowly but expend the same total energy as brisk walkers — meaning that they spend more time walking — they should gain the same health benefits. But few large-scale studies have directly compared the impact of moderate- and light-intensity walking especially in terms of longevity.    To do so Paul T. Williams a statistician at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory gathered data about 7374 male and 31607 female participants from the walkers’ health study who represented almost every speed of fitness walker from sluggish to swift. His findings were  published online this month in PLoS One. Dr. Williams divided participants into four numerically equal categories based on their normal pace. Those in Category 1 the fleetest averaged less than 13.5 minutes per mile putting them on the cusp of jogging while those in Category 4 the slowest strolled at a relatively dilatory 17 minutes or more per mile. The majority of the walkers in this group in fact required at least 20 minutes to complete a mile and many had a pace of 25 minutes or more per mile. (Interestingly on average female walkers were faster than men in all of the categories.)  Next Dr. Williams cross-referenced his data against that in the essential if somewhat ghoulish National Death Index to determine which of the almost 39000 walkers had died in the decade or so since they had joined the survey and from what. It turned out that nearly 2000 of the walkers had died. More telling these deaths disproportionately were clustered among the slowest walkers. Those in Category 4 were about 18 percent more likely to have died from any cause than those in the other three categories and were particularly vulnerable to deaths from heart disease and dementia.  Unexpectedly the death rate remained high among the slowest walkers even if they met or exceeded the standard exercise guidelines and expended as much energy per day as someone walking briskly for 30 minutes. This effect was most pronounced among the slowest of the slow walkers whose pace was 24 minutes per mile or higher. They were 44 percent more likely to have died than walkers who moved faster even if they met the exercise guidelines. One important inference of these statistics is that intensity matters if you are walking for health. “Our results do suggest that there is a significant health benefit to pursuing a faster pace” Dr. Williams said. Pushing your body he said appears to cause favorable physiological changes that milder exercise doesn’t replicate. But there are nuances and caveats to that conclusion. The slowest walkers may have harbored underlying health conditions that predisposed them to both a tentative walking pace and early death. But that possibility underscores a subtle takeaway of the new study Dr. Williams said. Measuring your walking speed he pointed out could provide a barometer of your health status.  So check yours your spouse’s or perhaps your parents’ pace. The process is easy. Simply find a 400-meter track and using a stopwatch have everyone walk at his or her normal speed. If a circuit of the track takes someone 6 minutes or more that person’s pace is 24 minutes per mile or slower and he or she might consider consulting a doctor about possible health issues Dr. Williams said.  Then with medical clearance the slow walkers probably should try ramping up their speed gradually.  The most encouraging news embedded in the new study is that longevity rises with small improvements in pace. The walkers in Category 3 for instance moved at a speed only a minute or so faster per mile than some of those in the slowest group but they enjoyed a significant reduction in their risk of dying prematurely.

22,100000002572844,1,Article,News,World,world,asia,U.S. Sends Two B-52 Bombers Into Air Zone Claimed by China,THOM SHANKER,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/world/asia/us-flies-b-52s-into-chinas-expanded-air-defense-zone.html,1,WASHINGTON  Defying China two long-range American bombers flew through contested airspace over the East China Sea days after the Chinese announced they were claiming the right to police the sky above a vast area that includes islands at the center of a simmering dispute with Japan.         Pentagon officials said Tuesday that the B-52s were on a routine training mission planned long in advance of the Chinese announcement on Saturday that it was  establishing an air defense identification zone  over the area. But the message was clear.         A senior Pentagon official said that the mission overnight Monday from Guam was a demonstration of long-established international rights to freedom of navigation and transit through international airspace. The official said the unilateral Chinese declaration of expanded control was provocative and only increases the risk of miscalculation in the region.         There was no immediate Chinese response to the flights conducted without prior notification as demanded under the new declaration from Beijing which asserted the right to identify monitor and possibly take military action against any aircraft that enter the area. The unexpected announcement by China was among its boldest moves yet in a struggle for power in Asia with the United States and by extension its regional allies including Japan. The United States long the dominant power in the region has been scrambling to shore up its influence there promising in what it called a pivot to Asia in 2011 to refocus its energies after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan diverted its time and resources.         Having Japan in the mix only adds volatility. The country has its own tangled history with China which has sped past Japan as an economic power and which retains bitter memories of imperial Japans military invasion last century. Under its conservative leader Shinzo Abe Japan has refused to back down in the dispute with China over the uninhabited islands which Japan has long controlled.         For the White House the flare-up could prove a major distraction for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as he embarks on a weeklong tour of China Japan and South Korea. Administration officials are eager to focus on issues like North Korea and an American-led trans-Pacific trade deal meant to bolster economic ties in the region even as China woos its neighbors with aid and investment.         The islands called the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China are currently administered by the Japanese who consider the airspace above the islands to be theirs. American officials have been increasingly worried about the standoff which they fear could lead to conflict. By treaty the United States is obligated to defend Japan if it is attacked.         But both China and Americas Asian allies know that Washingtons focus has been elsewhere a reality that became evident when President Obama had to cancel a trip to an Asian summit meeting during the recent American government shutdown.         Pressed on whether the Chinese move represents an overt attempt to fill an American security void in the region Pentagon officials responded by pointing to the American response to the catastrophic typhoon that struck the Philippines this month. The United States quickly moved in hundreds of Marines dozens of transport aircraft and an entire aircraft carrier strike group.  Chinas offer of military assistance  was feeble by comparison.         However Mr. Obama is fielding a new national security team with views on Asia that are still coalescing and with relatively little experience in the region.         In her first major speech on Asia policy last week Mr. Obamas national security adviser Susan E. Rice did not mention the mutual defense clause in the treaty between the United States and Japan  an omission her colleagues dismissed as irrelevant since American officials reiterate it religiously but which troubled some in Japan.         But Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel wasted no time in responding to the initial Chinese declaration issuing a statement on Saturday reiterating that the United States was steadfast in our commitments to our allies and partners. He also repeated that the mutual defense treaty with Japan applies to the disputed islands.         American officials said Tuesday that the United States military would continue to stage a standard cycle of training flights over the East China Sea. The flight by the bombers was first reported Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal.         The move by China on Saturday appeared to be another step in its efforts to intensify pressure on Japan over the contested islands. In the past year Chinese paramilitary ships have made almost daily incursions into the waters around the islands including waters claimed by Japan. The incursions have led to a constant game of cat-and-mouse on the high seas in which the Japanese Coast Guard pursues the Chinese ships with both sides using bullhorns and electronic sign boards to tell the other to stay out of its territorial waters.        
23,100000002547646,1,Article,News,World,world,asia,"With Glut of Lonely Men, China Has an Approved Outlet for Unrequited Lust",DAN LEVIN,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/world/asia/with-glut-of-lonely-men-china-has-an-approved-outlet-for-unrequited-lust.html,8,GUANGZHOU China  Slack-jawed and perspiring Chen Weizhou gazed at a pair of life-size female dolls clad just barely in lingerie and lace stockings. Above these silicone vixens an instructional video graphically depicted just how realistic they felt once undressed.         A 46-year-old tour bus driver Mr. Chen had come earlier this month to the Guangzhou National Sex Culture Festival for fun which was not how he described intimacy with his wife who did not attend. When youre young sex is so mysterious but once youre married it gets really bland he said barely taking his eyes off the screen.         With an official theme of healthy sex happy families the 11th annual exposition sought to remedy the plight of Chinese men like Mr. Chen  and their wives if they are married.         The overwhelming presence of men at the festival mirrored a demographic imbalance in China where decades of the one-child rule and a cultural preference for sons combined with illegal sex-selective abortions have distorted the countrys gender ratio to 118 newborn boys for every 100 girls in 2012 rather than the normal 103 boys. In Guangdong Province home to a migrant worker population of 30 million  Chinas largest  the scarcity of women leaves bachelors with limited options.         Filling an exhibition center here in the capital of Guangdong in southern China the festival was a three-day mating ritual between capitalism and hedonism all diligently observed by that most prudish of chaperones: the Chinese government. Erotic possibilities abounded including a transgender fashion show sliced deer antler marketed as an aphrodisiac naughty nurse costumes and some flesh-color objects disconcertingly called Captain Stabbing.         Three decades after China began shedding its priggish Mao-era mores sex is now a big business here. Across the country pink-lit hair salons staffed by provocatively garbed women compete with massage parlors and late-night paid companions who slip their business cards under hotel room doors. Those looking to enhance their encounters can shop at countless adult health product stores and on the Internet.         Most of the inventory is made in China. According to state news media more than 1000 Chinese companies manufacture around 70 percent of the worlds sex toys generating $2 billion a year as of 2010.         The bounty of carnal titillation must contend with the firm hand of the Communist Party which bans pornography and punishes those guilty of group licentiousness in the name of protecting traditional Chinese values. But the partys moral authority has frayed of late because of the publicized antics of its friskier members. In June a government official was sentenced to 13 years in prison for corruption after a video surfaced showing him in bed with an 18-year-old woman. His fall came three months after photos depicting a coterie of six naked people including a party official and his wife exploded on the Internet.         In an attempt to give the sex festival a veneer of respectability government-run medical organizations sponsored booths in a side room which were unsurprisingly desolate. The main draw was lust.         Thousands of visitors nearly all middle-aged men wielding cameras poured through the aisles in search of any visible flesh. Guys have been taking my picture all day said a bikini-clad model Liang Lin 23 who was hugging her bare midriff defensively as a throng of men jostled desperately to get a better shot.         Not far away a male crowd waited for a diminutive Japanese pornography star named Rei Mizuna to appear. When she finally emerged from a dressing room to hand out racy autographed photos her frenzied fans surged forward with such zeal they shattered a glass display case.         Those unrequited desires have helped spawn a booming domestic sex toy industry. A stuffed man doesnt know what its like to be hungry explained a salesman at one booth filled with inflatable dolls. Just then an older gentleman approached and tried to bargain over an $8 figure with black tresses and a vacant stare.

Then They Saw Your Tweets.,NATASHA SINGER,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/business/they-loved-your-gpa-then-they-saw-your-tweets.html,3,At Bowdoin College in Brunswick Me. admissions officers are still talking about the high school senior who attended a campus information session last year for prospective students. Throughout the presentation she apparently posted disparaging comments on Twitter about her fellow attendees repeatedly using a common expletive.         Perhaps she hadnt realized that colleges keep track of their social media mentions.         It was incredibly unusual and foolish of her to do that  Scott A. Meiklejohn Bowdoins dean of admissions  and financial aid told me last week. The college ultimately denied the student admission he said because her academic record wasnt competitive. But had her credentials been better those indiscreet posts could have scuttled her chances.         We would have wondered about the judgment of someone who spends their time on their mobile phone and makes such awful remarks Mr. Meiklejohn said.         As certain high school seniors work meticulously this month to finish their early applications to colleges some may not realize that comments they casually make online could negatively affect their prospects. In fact new  research from Kaplan Test Prep  the service owned by the Washington Post Company suggests that online scrutiny of college hopefuls is growing.         Of 381 college admissions officers who answered a Kaplan telephone questionnaire this year 31 percent said they had visited an applicants Facebook or other personal social media page to learn more about them  a five-percentage-point increase from last year. More crucially for those trying to get into college 30 percent of the admissions officers said they had discovered information online that had negatively affected an applicants prospects.         Students social media and digital footprint can sometimes play a role in the admissions process says Christine Brown the executive director of K-12 and college prep programs at Kaplan Test Prep. Its something that is becoming more ubiquitous and less looked down upon.         In the business realm employers now vet the online reputations of job candidates as a matter of course. Given the impulsiveness of typical teenagers however  not to mention the already fraught nature of college acceptances and rejections  the idea that admissions officers would covertly nose around the social media posts of prospective students seems more chilling.         There is some reason for concern. Ms. Brown says that most colleges dont have formal policies about admissions officers supplementing students files with their own online research. If colleges find seemingly troubling material online they may not necessarily notify the applicants involved.         To me its a huge problem said  Bradley S. Shear a lawyer specializing in social media  law. For one thing Mr. Shear told me colleges might erroneously identify the account of a person with the same name as a prospective student  or even mistake an impostors account  as belonging to the applicant potentially leading to unfair treatment. Often he added false and misleading content online is taken as fact.         These kinds of concerns prompted me last week to email 20 colleges and universities  small and large private and public East Coast and West Coast  to ask about their practices. Then I called admissions officials at 10 schools who agreed to interviews.         Each official told me that it was not routine practice at his or her institution for admissions officers to use Google searches on applicants or to peruse their social media posts. Most said their school received so many applications to review  with essays recommendations and often supplemental portfolios  that staff members wouldnt be able to do extra research online. A few also felt that online investigations might lead to unfair or inconsistent treatment.         As students use of social media is growing theres a whole variety of ways that college admissions officers can use it  Beth A. Wiser the director of admissions  at the University of Vermont told me. We have chosen to not use it as part of the process in making admissions decisions.         Other admissions officials said they did not formally prohibit the practice. In fact they said admissions officers did look at online material about applicants on an ad hoc basis. Sometimes prospective students themselves ask an admissions office to look at blogs or videos they have posted; on other occasions an admissions official might look up an obscure award or event mentioned by an applicant for purposes of elucidation.         Last year we watched some animation videos and we followed media stories about an applicant who was involved in a political cause says Will Hummel an admissions officer at  Pomona College in Claremont  Calif. But those were rare instances he says and the supplemental material didnt significantly affect the students admissions prospects.        
25,100000002591415,1,Article,News,World,world,europe,Protesters in Kiev Topple Lenin Statue as Rallies Grow,DAVID M. HERSZENHORN;ANDREW E. KRAMER,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/world/europe/kiev-teems-with-pro-europe-protesters-as-thousands-more-gather.html,1,KIEV Ukraine  Public protests thundered into a full-throttle civil uprising in Ukraine on Sunday as hundreds of thousands of protesters answered President Viktor F. Yanukovichs dismissiveness with their biggest rally so far demanding that he and his government resign.         At the height of the unrest on Sunday night a seething crowd toppled and smashed a statue of Lenin the most prominent monument to the Communist leader in Kiev. The act was heavy with symbolism underscoring the protesters rage at Russia over its role in the events that first prompted the protests: Mr. Yanukovichs abrupt refusal to sign sweeping political and free-trade agreements with the European Union.         After an electrifying assembly in Independence Square in the center of Kiev the main focus of the protests the huge crowd surged across the capital erecting barriers to block the streets around the presidential headquarters and pitching huge tents in strategic intersections. They were not challenged by the police who have largely disengaged since their bloody crackdown on a group of protesters on Nov. 30 sharply increased outrage at the government.         International concern over the unrest in Ukraine appeared to deepen on Sunday as the United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon telephoned Mr. Yanukovich and Western leaders continued to call on him to respond to the demonstrators demands. The European Union has been eager to draw Ukraine a nation of 46 million into closer alliance with the West while Russia has sought to safeguard its major economic and political interests in its close neighbor. Making the crisis more acute Ukraine is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy and is desperate for financial assistance from abroad.         The spreading disorder set off a new round of speculation that Mr. Yanukovich would declare a state of emergency and potentially turn again to force by ordering the removal of demonstrators who have occupied Independence Square and several public buildings including Kievs City Hall. There were reports on Sunday that the security services were preparing to bring charges of treason against three opposition leaders in Parliament who have been at the forefront of the demonstrations.         One of those leaders Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk of the opposition Fatherland party called for mass civil disobedience if Mr. Yanukovich tried to impose martial law. In the case that a state of emergency is declared everyone should go to Maidan Mr. Yatsenyuk said referring to Independence Square.         Mr. Yanukovich only added to the demonstrators anger by stopping on his way back from China on Friday to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Sochi the Russian resort city. Rumors immediately began swirling that Mr. Yanukovich had cut a secret economic deal with Mr. Putin that would lead to Ukraine joining a customs union with Russia Belarus and Kazakhstan a step that many Ukrainians believe would deliver their countrys future into the Kremlins hands. Both governments denied the rumors but the protesters do not trust either Mr. Putin or Mr. Yanukovich and opposition leaders used the matter on Sunday to whip up the crowd in Kiev.         Today they fall on their knees in front of the president of Russia and surrender us to the customs union said Oleg Tyagnibok the leader of the nationalist Svoboda Party. We demand to make public what these secret negotiations were about. They bring us back to the time of Stalinism. Is this 1937?         Later as the Lenin statue was pulled down and men took turns splintering it to bits with a sledgehammer protesters twice sang the national anthem removing their caps and covering their hearts with their hands. One of the hammerers wore his hair in a mohawk; another was a priest in black vestments. Onlookers shielded their faces from the flying granite chips as they cheered them on yelling: Good job guys.         A spokesman for Prime Minister Mykola Azarov called the statues destruction barbaric.        
26,100000002557178,1,Article,News,Health,health,,Risk Calculator for Cholesterol Appears Flawed,GINA KOLATA,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/health/risk-calculator-for-cholesterol-appears-flawed.html,1,Last week the nations leading heart organizations released a sweeping new set of guidelines for lowering  cholesterol  along with an  online calculator  meant to help doctors assess risks and treatment options. But in a major embarrassment to the health groups the calculator appears to greatly overestimate risk so much so that it could mistakenly suggest that millions more people are candidates for statin drugs.         The apparent problem prompted one leading cardiologist a past president of the American College of Cardiology to call on Sunday for a halt to the implementation of the new guidelines.         Its stunning said the cardiologist Dr. Steven Nissen chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. We need a pause to further evaluate this approach before it is implemented on a widespread basis.         The controversy set off turmoil at the annual meeting of the  American Heart Association  which started this weekend in Dallas. After an emergency session on Saturday night the two organizations that published the guidelines  the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology  said that while the calculator was not perfect it was a major step forward and that the guidelines already say patients and doctors should discuss treatment options rather than blindly follow a calculator.         Dr. Sidney Smith the executive chairman of the guideline committee said the associations would examine the flaws found in the calculator and determine if changes were needed. We need to see if the concerns raised are substantive he said in a telephone interview on Sunday. Do there need to be changes?         The problems were identified by two Harvard Medical School professors whose findings will be published Tuesday in a commentary in The Lancet a major medical journal. The professors Dr. Paul M. Ridker and Dr. Nancy Cook had pointed out the problems a year earlier when the National Institutes of Healths National Heart Lung and Blood Institute which originally was developing the guidelines sent a draft to each professor independently to review. Both reported back that the calculator was not working among the populations it was tested on by the guideline makers.         That was unfortunate because the committee thought the researchers had been given the professors responses said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones co-chairman of the guidelines task force and chairman of the department of  preventive medicine  at Northwestern University.         Drs. Ridker and Cook saw the final guidelines and risk calculator on Tuesday at 4 p.m. when a news embargo was lifted and saw that the problems remained.         On Saturday night members of the association and the college of cardiology held a hastily called closed-door meeting with Dr. Ridker who directs the Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston. He showed them his data and pointed out the problem. On Sunday officials from the organizations struggled with how to respond.         Other experts said there has not been a real appreciation of the difficulties with this and other risk calculators. I dont think people have a good idea of what needs to be done said Dr. Michael Blaha director of clinical research at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University who was not associated with forming the new guidelines.         Dr. Blaha said the problem might have stemmed from the fact that the calculator uses as reference points data collected more than a decade ago when more people smoked and had strokes and heart attacks earlier in life. For example the guideline makers used data from studies in the 1990s to determine how various risk factors like cholesterol levels and  blood pressure  led to actual heart attacks and strokes over a decade of observation.         But people have changed in the past few decades Dr. Blaha said. Among other things there is no longer such a big gap between womens risks and those of men at a given age. And people get heart attacks and strokes at older ages.         The cohorts were from a different era Dr. Blaha said.         This week after they saw the guidelines and the calculator Dr. Ridker and Dr. Cook evaluated it using three large studies that involved thousands of people and continued for at least a decade. They knew the subjects characteristics at the start  their ages whether they smoked their cholesterol levels their blood pressures. Then they asked how many had heart attacks or strokes in the next 10 years and how many would the risk calculator predict.         The answer was that the calculator overpredicted risk by 75 to 150 percent depending on the population. A man whose risk was 4 percent for example might show up as having an 8 percent risk. With a 4 percent risk he would not warrant treatment  the guidelines that say treatment is advised for those with at least a 7.5 percent risk and that treatment can be considered for those whose risk is 5 percent.        
27,100000002559986,1,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,"Night Falls, and 5Pointz, a Graffiti Mecca, Is Whited Out in Queens",CARA BUCKLEY;MARC SANTORA,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/nyregion/5pointz-a-graffiti-mecca-in-queens-is-wiped-clean-overnight.html,23,Graffiti is often denounced as vandalism but the deliriously festooned sprawling warehouses at the western edge of Queens rose far above that. Blanketed with giddy images drawing street artists from around the world  5Pointz  was a decades-old legal haven considered both a  United Nations of Graffiti  and a semi-rebellious statement in a city some feel is growing too antiseptic. Save  5Pointz  the infamous British street artist Banksy urged in his final message to New Yorkers after he wrapped his monthlong spree clandestinely decorating the citys streets in October.         But early Tuesday under the cover of night painters quietly blanketed much of the walls of 5Pointz with whitewash erasing the work of hundreds and seemingly putting the final nail in the long battle between the buildings owners who plan to erect luxury apartments and the artists who fought to save it.         This is the biggest rag and disrespect in the history of graffiti said a teary-eyed Marie Cecile Flaguel a spokeswoman for the group behind 5Pointz which sprang like a rainbow from the gray sidewalks near Jackson Avenue in Long Island City. Hes painted over the work of at least 1500 artists.         The owner of the buildings Jerry Wolkoff however said painting over the artwork was the humane thing to do. A recent order by a federal judge allows him to move forward with his plans to demolish the buildings by years end and he said watching the art-covered walls be pulled down piece by piece would be torture.         He also wanted to avoid a confrontation adding that there would be a 60-foot-high wall near the new towers where graffiti painters can work again.         I am telling you I did not like what they did  I loved what they did said Mr. Wolkoff who bought the buildings in 1971 and plans to build high-rise towers in their stead. I cried this morning I swear to you.         Yet many supporters of 5Pointz which became so well established that tourists flocked to it by the busload saw the clandestine erasing as a cruel vindictive move.         The fact that they destroyed the art before they razed the building its a really big slap in the face said Eric Felisbret an expert on street art and the author of Graffiti New York. So many people put so much passion and energy into it.         Though there are other spots in New York City where graffiti artists could legally work Mr. Felisbret said Theres nothing that was as large and that big of a draw internationally as 5Pointz.         Forty years ago after buying the buildings which were mostly abandoned at the time Mr. Wolkoff leased the space to a company that made record player accessories then eight-track tapes and then CD covers before moving out in the early 1990s.         Casting about for new tenants Mr. Wolkoff rented studios to artists for a few hundred dollars a month. Around that time he was also approached by a man who removed graffiti from buildings around the city and wanted to know if the painters could use Mr. Wolkoffs walls as canvases. Liking their work Mr. Wolkoff gave them more and more space. In 2002 a graffiti artist named Meres One took the endeavor over becoming its curator and christening it 5Pointz.         Five stories high the buildings occupied most of a city block a playful wacky visual counterpoint to the solemn low-slung MoMA PS 1 site across the street. The canary yellow walls were covered with constantly changing artwork  Brobdingnagian bubble letters colorful cartoons and meticulously wrought images created by painters from France Italy Japan and beyond. Stepping into 5Pointzs interior courtyard was like plunging into a lurid fever dream.         Though street art is meant to be temporary 5Pointz became known as a graffiti museum. And the medium itself once considered a symbol of urban unraveling became a sought after gallery-worthy commodity with work from street artists like Banksy commanding millions of dollars. Which is one of the reasons the whitewashing of 5Pointzs walls was greeted with such vociferous dismay. What?! What did they do?! cried a tour guide named Hans Von Rittern as he raced out of a tour bus early Tuesday his arms wide his face crumpling as soon as he caught sight of Ms. Flaguel. They embraced tightly and wept.        
28,100000002577238,1,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,,Obamacare’s Secret Success,PAUL KRUGMAN,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/29/opinion/krugman-obamacares-secret-success.html,39,The law establishing Obamacare was officially titled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. And the affordable bit wasnt just about subsidizing premiums. It was also supposed to be about bending the curve  slowing the seemingly inexorable rise in health costs.         Much of the Beltway establishment scoffed at the promise of cost savings. The prevalent attitude in Washington is that reform isnt real unless the little people suffer; serious savings are supposed to come from things like  raising the Medicare age  (which the Congressional Budget Office recently concluded would in fact hardly save any money) and throwing millions of Americans off Medicaid. True  a 2011 letter signed by hundreds of health and labor economists  pointed out that the Affordable Care Act contains essentially every cost-containment provision policy analysts have considered effective in reducing the rate of medical spending. But such expert views were largely ignored.         So hows it going? The health exchanges are off to a famously rocky start but many though by no means all of the cost-control measures have already kicked in. Has the curve been bent?         The answer amazingly is yes. In fact  the slowdown in health costs  has been dramatic.         O.K. the obligatory caveats. First of all we dont know how long the good news will last. Health costs in the United States slowed dramatically in the 1990s (although not this dramatically) probably thanks to the rise of health maintenance organizations but cost growth picked up again after 2000. Second we dont know for sure how much of the good news is because of the Affordable Care Act.         Still the facts are striking. Since 2010 when the act was passed real health spending per capita  that is total spending adjusted for overall inflation and population growth  has risen less than a third as rapidly as its long-term average. Real spending per Medicare recipient hasnt risen at all; real spending per Medicaid beneficiary has actually fallen slightly.         What could account for this good news? One obvious answer is the still-depressed economy which might be causing people to forgo expensive medical care. But this explanation turns out to be problematic in multiple ways. For one thing the economy had stabilized by 2010 even if the recovery was fairly weak yet health costs continued to slow. For another its hard to see why a weak economy would have more effect in reducing the prices of health services than it has on overall inflation. Finally Medicare spending shouldnt be affected by the weak economy yet it has slowed even more dramatically than private spending.         A better story focuses on what appears to be a decline in some kinds of medical innovation  in particular an absence of expensive new blockbuster drugs even as existing drugs go off-patent and can be replaced with cheaper generic brands. This is a real phenomenon; it is in fact the main reason the Medicare drug program has ended up costing less than originally projected. But since drugs are only about 10 percent of health spending it can only explain so much.         So what aspects of Obamacare might be causing health costs to slow? One clear answer is the acts reduction in Medicare overpayments  mainly a reduction in the subsidies to private insurers offering Medicare Advantage Plans but also cuts in some provider payments. A less certain but likely source of savings involves changes in the way Medicare pays for services. The program now penalizes hospitals if many of their patients end up being readmitted soon after being released  an indicator of poor care  and readmission rates have in fact fallen substantially. Medicare is also encouraging a shift from fee-for-service in which doctors and hospitals get paid by the procedure to accountable care in which health organizations get rewarded for overall success in improving care while controlling costs.         Furthermore theres evidence that Medicare savings spill over to the rest of the health care system  that when Medicare manages to slow cost growth private insurance gets cheaper too.         And the biggest savings may be yet to come.  The Independent Payment Advisory Board  a panel with the power to impose cost-saving measures (subject to Congressional overrides) if Medicare spending grows above target hasnt yet been established in part because of the near-certainty that any appointments to the board would be filibustered by Republicans yelling about death panels. Now that the filibuster has been reformed  the board can come into being .         The news on health costs is in short remarkably good. You wont hear much about this good news until and unless  the Obamacare website  gets fixed. But under the surface health reform is starting to look like a bigger success than even its most ardent advocates expected.        
29,100000002562745,1,Article,News,Home & Garden,garden,,The Nakeds Next Door,STEVEN KURUTZ,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/garden/the-nakeds-next-door.html,1,Shannon Sessoms has never been so ready for winter. Cold weather brings the promise of several months without awkward sightings of the neighbors whom her family refers to as the Nakeds.         Ms. Sessoms who lives with her husband and two young children in Harlem first spotted one of the Nakeds two summers ago while enjoying a glass of wine on her apartment balcony one evening. The balcony overlooks the backyards of several brownstones and out of the one directly opposite her emerged a 40ish woman with dreadlocks wearing nothing but a T-shirt.         I thought well maybe shes running outside to let the cat or dog in Ms. Sessoms 43 said. But then she started gardening nude.         As in shirt gone completely naked?         Completely naked Ms. Sessoms said.         She yelled for her husband to come look. Hes like I dont want to see my neighbor nakedÂ  she said. Im like No no you have to see. But by the time he came she was gone and he didnt believe me.         Credibility was restored as the sightings increased in frequency and began to involve other family members: the husband taking naked smoking breaks; the couple and their two young children dining alfresco and au natural.         The husband was grilling naked Ms. Sessoms said. Thats a little dangerous.         Ms. Sessoms was recalling these events on an unseasonably warm fall afternoon a few weeks ago on the same balcony that overlooks her neighbors yard. It was the kind of day a reporter pointed out that a nudist might regard as an invitation for a late-season frolic.         We were really excited about this balcony Ms. Sessoms said looking across at her neighbors yard warily. We dont enjoy it as much as we thought we would.         In a city like New York where residents live in such close proximity nudity is an often unavoidable part of domestic life. The living room window of one apartment faces the bedroom of another which has an unobstructed view into the bathroom of a third. Many of the citys interiors  especially those of some of the newer glass-sheathed buildings  afford all the privacy of a gym locker room. (Indeed in some corridors of the city  along the High Line  especially near  the Standard hotel  the nudity on display seems to be part of the attraction.)         And while some people are titillated or disturbed by seeing a neighbor naked others are driven to distraction as one man who  posted a letter on Craigslist  several years ago claimed to be. Under the heading Please stop walking around naked  25th Street he confessed to seeing his young blond female neighbor on several occasions and said that it was killing his work productivity. In his open letter he pleaded When you practice booty dancing in your underwear in front of the mirror then Im screwed.         The Craigslist poster complained that his neighbor not only danced half-naked but did so with the lights on and the blinds up a habit shared by other New Yorkers. Living among 8.3 million people tends to create a sense of anonymity and encourage a laid-back attitude toward baring it all at home. If the guy in the next building sees a flash of skin as you go from the shower to the closet  or practice booty dancing  so what?         In New York said  Helen Schulman a novelist  and professor of writing at a university in Manhattan you dont really know the people across the way. I dont think its the same in a small town.         From her office Ms. Schulman 52 enjoys a Rear Window-like view into a mix of prewar apartment buildings and townhouses. Over the years she said she has noticed one resident in particular: My window looks straight into his bedroom and he never closes his curtains or shades. Hes reliably naked. (She asked that her employer go unnamed so as not to embarrass the man.)         Half of literary New York has seen this immodest fellow Ms. Schulman joked explaining that when visiting writers come to her office she points him out. Its a really funny icebreaker she said.         If you havent seen someone in the buff or nearly naked its likely that someone has seen you. Most residents of big apartment buildings are skilled at the half-naked dash to the hall closet and back or the shirtless plunge into the hallway for the Sunday paper.         We all stumble out in the morning Ms. Schulman said of the residents of her Upper West Side building. If our neighbor comes out in boxers or a T-shirt I say Oh weve all seen it already.Â 

His humility his compassion and his humanity earned him their love.         Mr. Zuma called Mr. Mandelas death the moment of our deepest sorrow and said that South Africas thoughts were now with the former presidents family. They have sacrificed much and endured much so that our people could be free he said.         Mr. Mandela spent 27 years in prison after being convicted of treason by the white minority government only to forge a peaceful end to white rule by negotiating with his captors after his release in 1990. He led the African National Congress long a banned liberation movement to a resounding electoral victory in 1994 the first fully democratic election in the countrys history.         Mr. Mandela who was 95 served just one term as South Africas president and had not been seen in public since 2010 when the nation hosted the soccer World Cup. But his decades in prison and his insistence on forgiveness over vengeance made him a potent symbol of the struggle to end this countrys brutally codified system of racial domination and of the power of peaceful resolution in even the most intractable conflicts.         Years after he retreated from public life his name still resonated as an emblem of his effort to transcend decades of racial division and create what South Africans called a Rainbow Nation.         His commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him set an example that all humanity should aspire to a grim President Obama said Thursday evening describing Mr. Mandela as an influential courageous and profoundly good man who inspired millions  including himself  to a spirit of reconciliation.         Mr. Mandela and Mr. Obama both served as the first black leaders of their nations and both men won the Nobel Peace Prize. But the American president has shied away from comparisons often noting that his own sacrifices would never compare to the ones that Mr. Mandela endured.         Mr. Obama said that the world would not likely see the likes of Nelson Mandela again and he noted that the former South African president had once said that he was not a saint unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.         Mr. Zuma did not announce the specific cause of Mr. Mandelas death but he had battling pneumonia and other lung ailments for the past six months and had been in and out of the hospital. Though his death was announced close to midnight when most in this nation of early risers are asleep a small crowd quickly gathered outside the house where he once lived in Soweto on Vilekazi Street.         Nelson Mandela there is no one like you they sang stamping their feet in unison to a praise song usually sung in joy. But in the midnight darkness sadness tinged the melody.         He was our father our mother our everything said Numfundo Matli 28 a housekeeper who joined the impromptu celebration of Mr. Mandelas life. What will we do without him?         His death comes during a period of deep unease and painful self-examination for South Africa.         In the past year and a half the country has faced perhaps its most serious unrest since the end of apartheid provoked by a wave of wildcat  strikes by angry miners  a  deadly response on the part of the police  a messy  leadership struggle within the A.N.C.  and the deepening fissures between South Africas rulers and its impoverished masses.         Scandals over corruption involving senior members of the party have fed a broader perception that Mr. Mandelas near saintly legacy from the years of struggle has been eroded by a more recent scramble for self-enrichment among a newer elite.         After spending decades in penurious exile many political figures returned to find themselves at the center of a grab for power and money. Mr. Zuma himself was charged with corruption before rising to the presidency in 2009 though the charges were dropped on largely technical grounds. He has  faced renewed scrutiny  in the past year over $27 million spent in renovations to his house in rural Zululand.        
32,100000002557948,1,Article,News,Health,health,,Sleep Therapy Seen as an Aid for Depression,BENEDICT CAREY,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/health/treating-insomnia-to-heal-depression.html,1,Curing insomnia in people with depression could double their chance of a full recovery scientists are reporting. The findings based on an insomnia treatment that uses talk therapy rather than drugs are the first to emerge from a series of closely watched studies of sleep and depression to be released in the coming year.         The new report affirms the results of a smaller pilot study giving scientists confidence that the effects of the insomnia treatment are real. If the figures continue to hold up the advance will be the most significant in the treatment of depression since the introduction of Prozac in 1987.         Depression is the most common mental disorder affecting some 18 million Americans in any given year according to government figures and more than half of them also have insomnia.         Experts familiar with the new report said that the results were plausible and that if supported by other studies they should lead to major changes in treatment.         It would be an absolute boon to the field said Dr. Nada L. Stotland professor of psychiatry at Rush Medical College in Chicago who was not connected with the latest research.         It makes good common sense clinically she continued. If you have a depression youre often awake all night its extremely lonely its dark youre aware every moment that the world around you is sleeping every concern you have is magnified.         The study is the first of four on sleep and depression nearing completion all financed by the  National Institute of Mental Health . They are evaluating a type of talk therapy for insomnia that is cheap relatively brief and usually effective but not currently a part of standard treatment.         The new report from a team at Ryerson University in Toronto found that 87 percent of patients who resolved their insomnia in four biweekly talk therapy sessions also saw their depression symptoms dissolve after eight weeks of treatment either with an antidepressant drug or a placebo pill  almost twice the rate of those who could not shake their insomnia. Those numbers are in line with a previous pilot study of insomnia treatment at Stanford.         In an interview the reports lead author  Colleen E. Carney  said The way this story is unfolding I think we need to start augmenting standard depression treatment with therapy focused on insomnia.         Dr. Carney acknowledged that the study was small  just 66 patients  and said a clearer picture should emerge as the other teams of scientists released their results. Those studies are being done at Stanford Duke and the University of Pittsburgh and include about 70 subjects each. Dr. Carney will present her data on Saturday at a convention of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies in Nashville.         Doctors have known for years that sleep problems are intertwined with mood disorders. But only recently have they begun to investigate the effects of treating both at the same time. Antidepressant drugs like Prozac help many people as does talk therapy but in rigorous studies the treatments administered individually only slightly outperform placebo pills. Used together the treatments produce a cure rate  full recovery  for about 40 percent of patients.         Adding insomnia therapy however to an antidepressant would sharply lift the cure rate Dr. Carneys data suggests as do the findings from the Stanford pilot study which included 30 people.         Doctors have long considered poor sleep to be a symptom of depression that would clear up with treatments said Rachel Manber a professor in the psychiatry and behavioral sciences department at Stanford whose 2008 pilot trial of insomnia therapy provided the rationale for larger studies. But we now know thats not the case she said. The relationship is bidirectional  that insomnia can precede the depression.         Full-blown insomnia is more serious than the sleep problems most people occasionally have. To qualify for a diagnosis people must have endured at least a month of chronic sleep loss that has caused problems at work at home or in important relationships. Several studies now suggest that developing insomnia doubles a persons risk of later becoming depressed  the sleep problem preceding the mood disorder rather than the other way around.        
33,100000002558075,1,Article,News,Sports,sports,football,"Quitting the N.F.L.: For John Moffitt, the Money Wasn’t Worth It",KEN BELSON,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/sports/football/quitting-the-nfl-for-john-moffitt-the-money-wasnt-worth-it.html,12,SEATTLE  John Moffitt chugged mugs of black coffee and talked almost giddily about how the week before he called John Elway the head of football operations for the  Denver Broncos  to tell him he was quitting the  National Football League  leaving behind the money and the fame but also the constant pain and the danger.         In parts of three seasons as a guard with the  Seattle Seahawks  and the Broncos Moffitt 27 blew out his knee had elbow surgery and hurt his shoulders. Sleep apnea left him exhausted. Floaters cross his vision from all the hits to the head he absorbed in his nearly 20 years of playing football.         I dont want to risk health for money said Moffitt who walked away from about $1 million in salary various benefits for retirees who play at least three seasons and quite possibly a trip to the Super Bowl with the 9-1 Broncos. Im happy and I dont need the N.F.L.         Most weeks the departure of a player like Moffitt who played sporadically and often anonymously on the offensive line would have warranted barely a footnote among fans and general managers and his spot on the roster would have been quickly filled by an eager replacement.         But Moffitt quit the same week that the N.F.L. was consumed by allegations of bullying on the Miami Dolphins and disturbing reports that the former Dallas Cowboys running back Tony Dorsett and other retired stars might have early onset degenerative brain disease.         The heightened awareness of footballs physical tolls has prompted hundreds of former players to express regret over what the sport did to their bodies.Â Yet Moffitt is unique for openly discussing his injuries and the brutal reality of playing in the N.F.L.Â          They are merchandising human beings lets be honest said MoffittÂ who at a cafe in Pike Place Market in Seattle reveled in his freedom much like the Tim Robbins character in The Shawshank Redemption who after breaking out of jail rips off his shirt in the rain and laughs at the sky.         In a far-reaching interview last week Moffitt described how his decision to leave the N.F.L. a level he worked so hard to reach was far from rash even though he announced it on Twitter and was accused online of being impulsive and naÃ¯ve.         Quitting he said had little to do with his diminished playing time though he suited up for only two games this season or any dissatisfaction with the Seahawks or Broncos organizations which he said treated him well.         Rather it was the culmination of months of reflection that his once-promising career had been derailed by injuries and that continuing to play for the money and to please others would very likely ruin his health further and deepen his gloom.         In the off-season after battling for playing time and trying to stay fit Moffitt a free spirit who idolizes Jim Morrison started reading the writings of the Dalai Lama and Noam Chomsky among others. They helped him conclude that he was a pawn in a machine that controlled his life and that he no longer wanted to meet the expectations attached to that life.         You kind of let go of that dream that you kill yourself for to be a millionaire and you see through it and see that its just a facade said Moffitt who was dressed in baggy jeans T-shirt work boots and black pea coat. I let go of all that stuff.         Moffitt returned to training camp harboring doubts. In August the Seahawks traded him to Cleveland but the deal was reversed because the Browns said they had concerns about his health. Moffitt said the Browns voided the trade because he refused to take a pay cut something the team denied.         So the Seahawks traded Moffitt to the Broncos for whom he had an opportunity to protect Peyton Manning probably the N.F.L.s biggest star. To outsiders it was a dream job with a near-certain trip to the playoffs. But the trade only confirmed to Moffitt that he did not control his destiny.         His love of the game changed because its a business in the N.F.L. his father Dave Moffitt said. The minute he signed I told him: Youre John Moffitt Inc. The rah-rah is great for the fans but you have to treat yourself as a business.        
34,100000002545716,1,Article,News,Magazine,magazine,,Switzerland’s Proposal to Pay People for Being Alive,ANNIE LOWREY,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/magazine/switzerlands-proposal-to-pay-people-for-being-alive.html,18,This fall a truck dumped eight million coins outside the Parliament building in Bern one for every Swiss citizen. It was a publicity stunt for advocates of an audacious social policy that just might become reality in the tiny rich country. Along with the coins activists delivered 125000 signatures  enough to trigger a Swiss public referendum this time on providing a monthly income to every citizen no strings attached. Every month every Swiss person would receive a check from the government no matter how rich or poor how hardworking or lazy how old or young. Poverty would disappear. Economists needless to say are sharply divided on what would reappear in its place  and whether such a basic-income scheme might have some appeal for other less socialist countries too.         The proposal is in part the brainchild of a German-born artist named Enno Schmidt a leader in the basic-income movement. He knows it sounds a bit crazy. He thought the same when someone first described the policy to him too. I tell people not to think about it for others but think about it for themselves Schmidt told me. What would you do if you had that income? What if you were taking care of a child or an elderly person? Schmidt said that the basic income would provide some dignity and security to the poor especially Europes underemployed and unemployed. It would also he said help unleash creativity and entrepreneurialism: Switzerlands workers would feel empowered to work the way they wanted to rather than the way they had to just to get by. He even went so far as to compare it to a civil rights movement like womens suffrage or ending slavery.         When we spoke Schmidt repeatedly described the policy as  stimmig . Like many German words it has no English equivalent but it means something like coherent and harmonious with a dash of beauty thrown in. It is an idea whose time has come he was saying. And basic-income schemes are having something of a moment even if they are hardly new. (Thomas Paine was an advocate.) But their renewed popularity says something troubling about the state of rich-world economies.         Go to a cocktail party in Berlin and there is always someone spouting off about the benefits of a basic income just as you might hear someone talking up Robin Hood taxes in New York or single-payer health care in Washington. And its not only in vogue in wealthy Switzerland. Beleaguered and debt-wracked Cyprus is weighing the implementation of basic incomes too. They even are whispered about in the United States where certain wonks on the libertarian right and liberal left have come to a strange convergence around the idea  some prefer an unconditional basic income that would go out to everyone no strings attached; others a means-tested minimum income to supplement the earnings of the poor up to a given level.         The case from the right is one of expediency and efficacy. Lets say that Congress decided to provide a basic income through the tax code or by expanding the Social Security program. Such a system might work better and be fairer than the current patchwork of programs including welfare food stamps and housing vouchers. A single father with two jobs and two children would no longer have to worry about the hassle of visiting a bunch of offices to receive benefits. And giving him a single lump sum might help him use his federal dollars better. Housing vouchers have to be spent on housing food stamps on food. Those dollars would be more valuable  both to the recipient and the economy at large  if they were fungible.         Even better conservatives think such a program could significantly reduce the size of our federal bureaucracy. It could take the place of welfare food stamps housing vouchers and hundreds of other programs all at once: Hello basic income; goodbye H.U.D. Charles Murray of the conservative American Enterprise Institute has proposed a minimum income for just that reason  feed the poor and starve the beast. Give the money to the people Murray wrote in his book In Our Hands: A Plan to Replace the Welfare State. He suggested guaranteeing $10000 a year to anyone meeting the following conditions: be American be over 21 stay out of jail and  as he once quipped  have a pulse.        
35,100000002552877,1,Article,News,Health,health,,Addiction Treatment With a Dark Side,DEBORAH SONTAG,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/health/in-demand-in-clinics-and-on-the-street-bupe-can-be-savior-or-menace.html,,For Shawn Schneider a carpenter and rock musician the descent into addiction began one Wisconsin winter with a fall from a rooftop construction site onto the frozen ground below. As the potent pain pills prescribed for his injuries became his obsessive focus he lost everything: his band his job his wife his will to live.         Mr. Schneider was staying in his parents basement when he washed down 40 sleeping pills with NyQuil and beer. His father heard him gasping and intervened a reprieve that led Mr. Schneider into rehab not his first program but the one where he discovered buprenorphine a substitute opioid used to treat opioid addiction.         In the two years since by taking his bupe twice daily and meeting periodically with the prescribing psychiatrist Mr. Schneider 38 has rebounded. He is sober remarried employed building houses half of a new acoustic duo and one of the many addicts who credit buprenorphine sold mostly in a compound called Suboxone with saving their lives.         Suboxone did not save Miles Malone 20; it killed him. In 2010 a friend texted Mr. Malone an invitation to use the drug recreationally  we can do the suboxins as soon as I give them to u iight dude?  and he died that night in South Berwick Me. of buprenorphine poisoning. The friend Shawn Verrill was sentenced this summer to 71 months in prison.         I didnt know you could overdose on Suboxone Mr. Verrill said in an interview at a federal prison in Otisville N.Y. We were just a bunch of friends getting high and hanging out doing what 20-year-olds do. Then we went to sleep and Miles never woke up.         Suboxone is the blockbuster drug most people have never heard of. Surpassing well-known medications like  Viagra  and Adderall it generated $1.55 billion in United States sales last year its success fueled by an exploding opioid abuse epidemic and the embrace of federal officials who helped finance its development and promoted it as a safer less stigmatized alternative to methadone.         But more than a decade after Suboxone went on the market and with the Affordable Care Act poised to bring many more addicts into treatment the high hopes have been tempered by a messy reality. Buprenorphine has become both medication and dope: a treatment with considerable successes and also failures as well as a street and prison drug bedeviling local authorities. It has attracted unscrupulous doctors and caused more health complications and deaths than its advocates acknowledge.         It has also become a lucrative commodity creating moneymaking opportunities  for manufacturers doctors drug dealers and even patients  that have undermined a public health innovation meant for social good. And the drugs problems have emboldened some insurers to limit coverage of the medication which cost state  Medicaid  agencies at least $857 million over a three-year period through 2012 a New York Times survey found.         Intended as a long-term treatment for people addicted to opioids  heroin as well as painkillers  buprenorphine like methadone is an opioid itself that can produce euphoria and cause dependency. Its effects are milder however and they plateau making overdoses less likely and less deadly. And unlike methadone buprenorphine (pronounced byoo-pruh-NOR-feen) is available to addicts by prescription though only from federally authorized doctors with restricted patient loads.         Partly because of these restrictions a volatile subculture has arisen with cash-only buprenorphine clinics feeding a thriving underground market that caters to addicts who buy it to stave off withdrawal or treat themselves because they cannot find or afford a doctor; to recreational users who report a potent durable buzz; and to inmates who see it as prison heroin and especially in a new dissolvable filmstrip form as ideal contraband.         Its such a thin strip theyll put it in the Holy Bible let it melt and eat a page right out of the good book said Ken Mobley a jailer in Whitley County Ky. who randomly screened 50 inmates recently and found 21 positive for Suboxone.         Many buprenorphine doctors are addiction experts capable they say of treating far more than the federal limit of 100 patients. But because of that limit an unmet demand for treatment has created a commercial opportunity for prescribers attracting some with histories of overprescribing the very pain pills that made their patients into addicts.         A relatively high proportion of buprenorphine doctors have troubled records a Times examination of the federal buprenorphine physician locator found. In West Virginia one hub of the opioid epidemic the doctors listed are five times as likely to have been disciplined as doctors in general; in Maine another center they are 14 times as likely.         Nationally at least 1350 of 12780 buprenorphine doctors have been sanctioned for offenses that include excessive narcotics prescribing insurance fraud sexual misconduct and practicing medicine while impaired. Some have been suspended or arrested leaving patients in the lurch.         Statistics released in the last year show sharp increases in buprenorphine  seizures  by law enforcement in reports to poison centers in emergency room visits for the nonmedical use of the drug and in pediatric hospitalizations for accidental ingestions as small as a lick.         Buprenorphines staunchest proponents see these indicators as a byproduct of the drugs rising circulation and emphasize its safety relative to other opioids.         The benefits are high the risk is low and it is worth it on a population-wide basis said Dr. Stuart Gitlow the president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.         But Dr. Robert Newman a leading advocate of methadone treatment said The safety factor should not be oversold.         It is diverted and sold on the black market he said. It is misused and it does lead to medically adverse consequences including death. It is associated with a large number of deaths.         The addiction drug was a primary suspect in 420 deaths in the United States reported to the Food and Drug Administration since it reached the market in 2003 according to a Times analysis of federal data.         But buprenorphine is not being monitored systematically enough to gauge the full scope of its misuse some experts say. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not track buprenorphine deaths most medical examiners do not routinely test for it and neither do most emergency rooms prisons jails and drug courts.         Ive been studying the emergence of potential drug problems in this country for over 30 years said Eric Wish the director of the Center for Substance Abuse Research at the University of Maryland. This is the first drug that nobody seems to want to know about as a potential problem.         The government has a vested interest in its success.         The treatment is the fruit of an extraordinary public-private partnership between a British company and the American government which financed clinical trials and awarded protection from competition after the drugs patent expired.         The company now a consumer goods giant called  Reckitt Benckiser  hired several federal officials who had shepherded the drug and it has financially supported many of the scientists and doctors who are studying it and advocating its use. But over the last few years the companys aggressive campaign to protect its lucrative franchise has alienated some of its customers and allies.         In an 11th-hour bid to thwart generic competition and dominate the market with its patent-protected Suboxone filmstrip the company sought to convince regulators that the tablet form which earned it billions of dollars now presented a deadly risk to children as packaged in pill bottles.         The F.D.A. did not agree. Early this year it approved generic tablets and asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate potentially anticompetitive business practices by the company.         Reckitt Benckiser defended its advocacy for the Suboxone filmstrip  now its only pharmaceutical product  saying its research showed that the film was safer than the tablets kept addicts in treatment longer and had less of a street presence. It added that it was overseeing an F.D.A.-required risk evaluation and mitigation strategy to promote the appropriate use of buprenorphine with the goal to minimize the misuse abuse and multidose unintentional exposure of these products.         Dr. John Mendelson of San Francisco a consultant for the company said it could be proud of its management of a difficult product. Their biggest success so far he said is that the whole system has not imploded that enough doctors have prescribed the drug appropriately that there has been no move to withdraw it from the market.         Ronni Katz a health official in Portland Me. is less impressed.         I remember the early days when we met with the pharma rep in the area  I dont think he was trying to mislead us  he truly believed it was a miracle drug she said. But they way underestimated the potential for abuse which means to me they really dont understand addiction.         Nearly a half-century ago buprenorphine was born in the laboratory of an English company specializing in mustard and shoe polish where chemists were competing to invent a less addictive painkiller.         We were trying to beat morphine not methadone said John W. Lewis 81 who oversaw the drugs development.         Though far more potent than morphine buprenorphine appeared in animal tests to be unusually safe even in very high doses. In 1971 Dr. Lewis and colleagues traveled to an infirmary in Glasgow to conduct the first human tests  on themselves.         Buprenorphine made Dr. Lewis violently ill. It quite took the edge off our stay in a splendid hotel on the banks of Loch Lomond he said in a speech and it exposed the painkillers Achilles heel  the rather high incidence of  nausea and vomiting .         In the mid-1970s Dr. Lewis began shipping the drug to the United States Narcotic Farm in Lexington Ky. to test its abuse potential on detoxified addicts. A prison that doubled as a treatment hospital the farm was home to the governments Addiction Research Center (and at times to jazz greats like Chet Baker Elvin Jones and Sonny Rollins).         With opposition to human research mounting buprenorphine would be the last drug tested there; government scientists justified the research by arguing that the painkiller also had the potential to treat addiction.         Heres the thing: The Lexingtonians were against methadone said Nancy Campbell a historian of drug policy. They felt like addicts liked it too much and it had overdose potential. They never thought abstinence and Just Say No would work with this population. So they were eager to find an alternative.         The idea of using opioid substitutes to treat opioid dependence is based on the premise that long-term drug use profoundly alters the brain that the craving seeking and taking of opioids is a bio-behavioral compulsion. While addiction is considered a chronic relapsing disease experts believe that replacing illegal drugs with legal ones needles with pills or liquids and more dangerous opioids with safer ones reduces the harm to addicts and to society.         Like heroin buprenorphine attaches to the brains opioid receptors but it does not plug in as completely. It is slower acting and longer lasting attenuating the rush of sensation and eliminating the plummets afterward. Addicts develop a tolerance to its euphoric effects and describe themselves as normalized by it their cravings satisfied. It also diminishes the effects of other opioids but studies have shown does not entirely block them even at the highest recommended doses.         A devoted cadre of government scientists saw buprenorphine as a holy grail and over the next few decades floated in between the public and private sector for most of their careers Dr. Campbell said. The farms pharmacist would become an executive vice president of Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals for example and the company would contract with the former National Institute on Drug Abuse director who originally promoted the public-private partnership.         It was a collaboration that the company whose brand names include Lysol resisted for a long time said Charles OKeeffe a former White House drug policy official who incorporated Reckitt in the United States.         They were grocers he said. Finally I went to the board and said Its for the social good. Ultimately they relented but said Just dont spend a lot of money.Â          He did not have to. The federal  drug abuse  institute financed the two big clinical trials necessary to win F.D.A. approval for $28 million and later spent an additional $52.4 million for studies at its clinical research sites. At least $19 million more in studies are underway.         Further the F.D.A. granted the company a seven-year monopoly based on its claim that it would never recoup its development costs. (Reckitt now has a market value of $56.7 billion; 21 percent of its operating profits last year came from Suboxone.)         Still hurdles had to be cleared.         First Mr. OKeeffe said We had to change the law because it would have been illegal.         The Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 as interpreted prohibited doctors from prescribing narcotics to narcotics addicts to maintain their addictions. In the 1970s methadone treatment was authorized but limited to clinics where the drug was dispensed usually daily.         The original advocates of buprenorphine though wanted to make addiction treatment mainstream rather than segregate addicts in clinics that became lightning rods for community opposition. They wanted doctors in offices to prescribe it just like any other take-home medication.         So Mr. OKeeffe found influential members of Congress interested in doing this: Senators Carl Levin Democrat of Michigan and Orrin G. Hatch Republican of Utah with support from Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. Democrat of Delaware. In the end because of law enforcement concerns the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 included unique prescribing restrictions: that doctors seek federal permission get eight hours of training accept a 30-patient limit and attest to their ability to make counseling referrals.         The concerns grew from other countries experiences with buprenorphine treatment over the previous decade; successes had been accompanied by abuses. So F.D.A. officials insisted on the addition of an abuse deterrent  naloxone. If addicts crushed and injected the tablets the naloxone would precipitate excruciating withdrawal symptoms.         The Drug Enforcement Administration was skeptical saying studies showed that naloxone did not provoke any evidence of withdrawal in a substantial percentage of opiate abusers and that the amount in the proposed compound would produce only a half-hour of unpleasantness in those susceptible.         Skeptical too were buprenorphines original champions at Reckitt who would have preferred a different additive or more naloxone. It was not a perfect solution Dr. Lewis said.         Even so Suboxone  four parts buprenorphine one part naloxone  was created. And in late 2002 along with Subutex (plain buprenorphine) it was approved by the F.D.A. just as its target audience was about to expand unexpectedly.         An estimated 2.5 million Americans were dependent on or abused opioids last year mostly painkillers although heroin dependence has skyrocketed with the number of addicts doubling over a decade to 467000 government data indicate. In 2010 the last year studied 19154 people died of opioid overdoses.         Had buprenorphine never been released and all we had was methadone that number would be much higher said Dr. Andrew Kolodny the president of  Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing .         In the early days of Suboxone with Reckitt Benckiser barely marketing its own drug Dr. Kolodny then a New York City health official crisscrossed the city with colleagues to spread the word about the new medication entice public hospitals to try it with $10000 rewards and urge doctors to get certified.         We had New York City staff out there acting like drug reps Dr. Kolodny said.         He himself became a prescriber. All of a sudden I started getting calls from white kids on Long Island who were all addicted to pain pills he said. It was 2003 or 2004 and my first experience of the painkiller epidemic.         A psychiatrist accustomed to the slow subtle effects of  antidepressants  and mood stabilizers Dr. Kolodny was stunned by patients who arrived a total mess and in days seemed back to normal.         Im thinking this cures all addictions he said.         Dr. Jeffrey T. Junig of Wisconsin experienced a similar revelation. He was concerned that buprenorphine would create all these dry drunks people who were no longer using but who hadnt addressed their defects. Instead he witnessed something different: The process of craving opioids itself causes people to be so one-dimensional that it is a defect itself. Freed from the obsession to use people change.         Buprenorphine worked so well on his first patients middle-aged painkiller addicts that they would have tears rolling down their faces talking about how grateful they were he said.         Among them was Shawn Schneider who had found his way to Dr. Junig after swallowing 400 milligrams of Ambien thinking If I wake up I wake up; if I die I die.         Like Mr. Schneider dozens of addicts interviewed portrayed themselves as exhausted and frightened before they started on Suboxone. They acknowledged having loved their chosen opiate but not what turned into a miserable existence dominated by drug-seeking to avoid dope sickness.         Travis Norton 33 gravitated to heroin in  adolescence  as a result of a misguided infatuation with artist addicts like William S. Burroughs and Kurt Cobain he said. For years he cycled through costly abstinence-based programs always returning to the needle.         I was a chronic relapse said Mr. Norton who is now an addiction counselor in a Minneapolis suburb. I was a wreck until I started maintenance therapy in 2003. And Ive been great since.         Mr. Norton switched for a time to methadone when his Suboxone doctor retired. At that point Suboxone around $16 for an average daily dose was considered the rich mans methadone. Mr. Norton not rich but a college-educated professional found the methadone clinic a ball and a chain.         I had to travel for my job and there was zero flexibility he said. They had thousands of clients and I was a number.         Dr. Edwin A. Salsitz of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York who has been treating addiction for decades said that in the pre-Suboxone universe he encountered all too many middle-class addicts who refused to set foot in a clinic.         And then sometimes a couple of years later theyd be  H.I.V.  positive or something more catastrophic would have occurred he said. Theres no way to explain what this meant to the addiction field to have another option besides the clinics.         Reckitt Benckiser gradually built a stable of doctors paid to advocate use of the treatment Dr. Salsitz among them.         The recruiting was tough. Those outside the addiction field were reluctant to deal with the hassles of certification potential visits by the D.E.A. and the addicts themselves. Within the field buprenorphine faced stiff opposition from the methadone industry as well as traditional rehabilitation programs and the Alcoholics Anonymous movement which promotes abstinence.         With Suboxone there is a lot of misinformation out there and the most common is youve replaced one drug with another said Melissa Iverson a 48-year-old social worker who lives in Florida and is now on disability because of  fibromyalgia .         Ms. Iverson first requested anonymity like most other professionals interviewed some of whom have never acknowledged their problem to their families primary care physicians or even insurers. Eventually she decided to come out of the closet saying The stigma needs to be tackled by real people with real names or else it will haunt us forever.         Relying on ever-escalating doses of painkillers to cope with her chronic pain she had gone crazy out of control. Her life revolved around pills; she would pass out smoking in bed and wake up with burns on her hands or get into car accidents and nod out in the tow truck. Four years ago she had a  psychotic  break ended up hospitalized and came out on Suboxone.         In contrast to her painkiller use she has taken Suboxone at increasingly lower doses finding that it alleviates her pain without those self-destructive behaviors.         As an addict I was high all the time she said. With Suboxone I developed a tolerance within a week. Theres zero euphoria.         Successes like hers multiplied until demand outstripped supply because of the limited number of doctors and the patient cap. This brought some unintended consequences.         First some prescribers pushed patients off the medication prematurely to replace them with new patients because the early treatment phase was more lucrative. Second patients began sharing the drug trading it and selling it. Buprenorphine trickled out onto the street.         Health officials concerned about restricted access lobbied alongside Reckitt Benckiser for the patient cap to be raised. Why should we bind a healers hands from helping as many as he or she could? Senator Hatch said getting an amendment passed in 2006 that allowed doctors on request to go from 30 to 100 patients after a year.         The stage was set for more patients prescriptions and problems. Its when the limit was raised from 30 that doctors started to get commercial about it said Dr. Art Van Zee whose buprenorphine program at a federally funded community health center in rural Virginia is surrounded by for-profit clinics where doctors charge $100 for weekly visits pulling in he estimated about $500000 a year.         They are not savvy about addiction medicine dont follow patients very closely dont do urine testing and overprescribe he said. Thats how buprenorphine became a street drug in our area.         In Fond du Lac Wis. on the shores of Lake Winnebago addicts come and go from a bland building housing a medical office a cheese business and a title company. They bring their tumultuous lives into a tranquil space with hunter green walls heathered carpet and easy-listening music presided over by Dr. Junigs wife Nancy candy jar by her side.         Fond du Lac Psychiatry is the kind of setting the original idealists envisioned. They did not foresee the buprenorphine mega-clinics that resemble and frequently double as painkiller pill mills sometimes with armed guards to protect their cash.         They did not foresee a buprenorphine empire like the one Dr. Thomas E. Radecki 67 built in northwestern Pennsylvania.         According to the evidence presented to a grand jury this summer Dr. Radecki operated four clinics under the business name Doctors and Lawyers for a Drug-Free Youth serving 1000 people many of whom did not need or use buprenorphine and resold it in their neighborhoods. To override the patient limit he employed other doctors part time. He sold the drug directly to patients which is legal and was the countrys largest individual buyer of buprenorphine in the first half of last year according to investigators. The previous year he netted $280000 in profits from the tablets alone they said.         In August the Pennsylvania attorney general announced Dr. Radeckis arrest on charges of improper prescribing and trading addiction drugs for sex. His lawyer John Froese said Dr. Radecki denies that he ever prescribed any medicine that was not helpful to his patients or had sexual relationships with his buprenorphine patients.         Dr. Radecki lost his Illinois license for just such a relationship and his Pennsylvania license was made probationary in 2007. Nonetheless the federal government subsequently authorized him to prescribe buprenorphine and then expand his patient load.         Very few if any doctors are denied permission unless they are under investigation or something pops up said Rusty Payne a D.E.A. spokesman.         The Times analyzed the disciplinary records of the doctors on the federal governments online listing of buprenorphine providers which is not comprehensive because doctors can opt out and calculated state-by-state disciplinary rates.         In 30 of the 31 states that provided their overall disciplinary rates for comparison buprenorphine doctors are far more likely to have been sanctioned than doctors over all. In Florida and Kentucky they are four times as likely to have been sanctioned. In New York they are six times as likely; in Arizona seven times; in Minnesota nine times; and in Louisiana 10 times.         Rates are even higher for the subset certified to treat the maximum patient load The Times found in analyzing records from a sampling of states.         In Ohio nearly 17 percent have disciplinary records compared with 1.6 percent of all doctors. They include individuals sanctioned for:  amphetamine  addiction coupled with a Medicaid-fraud conviction; conducting an excessive number of invasive procedures; smuggling  steroids  from Mexico; engaging in conversations regarding a murder for hire and neglecting to report the rape of a pediatric patient; digitally penetrating patients and having sexual intercourse with them in the office.         Some were reprimanded or placed on probation before becoming Suboxone doctors; others stripped of their licenses recently had their offices shuttered.         This adds to the volatility of the treatment culture.         A 30-year-old Michigan woman said she was invited into treatment by a doctor who frequented the strip club where she was a bartender and who paid for her medication for several months. When he was placed on probation for violation of duty/negligence unrelated to her she switched to a second doctor who also got in trouble. After that the woman bought her buprenorphine on the street for a year  saving $5500 in medical and counseling fees she noted  until she found an addiction specialist with an opening.         In some areas like New York City there is almost a glut of buprenorphine prescribers. In others specialists routinely turn away addicts begging for help.         Non-specialists pick up the slack.         Reckitt Benckiser recruited any doctor willing said one former company drug representative who asked not to be identified to protect her career. Those in her territory ranged from extremely passionate to intensely commercial she said: One charged a $50 co-pay and another $500 for an initial visit. I had a few physicians using the medication themselves. One guy was so enthusiastic I signed him up as a treatment advocate but then it turned out he relapsed and lost his license.         Just because doctors have disciplinary histories does not mean that they are unscrupulous. Some of the most knowledgeable compassionate addiction doctors are former addicts themselves with medical board actions on their records that sometimes limit their career options.         Dr. Junig 53 is an anesthesiologist with a doctorate in neurochemistry who retrained as a psychiatrist after his own recovery from addiction. He did not intend to become a buprenorphine doctor.         To be honest I was just trying to build a practice he said.         Nor did he intend to become a buprenorphine blogger or the host of an online conversation about the drug through his website  Suboxone Forum  which gets 30000 visits weekly and a LinkedIn group with nearly 800 professional members. It grew from his initial passion for the treatment  a passion that got him hired briefly as a treatment facilitator for Reckitt Benckiser and also got him in trouble.         In 2011 the Wisconsin medical board reprimanded him for using tele-psychiatry to treat five out-of-state addicts he had seen only over Skype.         Over time Dr. Junig said he moved from skeptic to true believer to skeptic. Others similarly modulated their enthusiasm as they gained a nuanced appreciation of the difficulties of managing a complex patient population and a medication that had become a rampant street drug.         Some patients stopped and started their medication so they could still use other opiates or mixed it dangerously with drugs like Xanax. Appointments were missed prescriptions lost. Patients cheated dropped out and relapsed sometimes fatally.         Joseph McMahon IV a gregarious troubled New Yorker was prescribed a couple of thousand Suboxone pills over nearly three years. Still he overdosed on other drugs at least five times and at 25 died of one final overdose in December 2011 turning his father a retired New York City fire lieutenant into a bereft chronicler of Suboxone abuse.         My son swore Suboxone was working for him Joseph McMahon III said. But if Im an alcoholic and you switch my Budweiser for a Bud Lite sure Im doing great. They call Suboxone heroin in a pill. It makes tons of money for the pharmaceutical industry which has us totally bamboozled and for these doctors.         For Dr. Junig early positive experiences with older patients have been offset by rocky ones with a new generation of heroin and poly-drug abusers.         Last spring he prepared to confront a 26-year-old patient who had landed in an emergency room with an arm infected from injecting cocaine. The man had tried to hide his cocaine use by presenting a specimen of old urine to Dr. Junig who said Im an inch from kicking him out but I think hell die if I do.         The patient a mechanic with a young daughter said he had slipped up during a period of homelessness. It was just cocaine he said. I dont even really like cocaine. I wanted to tell you so bad man. But if I lose the Suboxone Ill go back to the heroin and the pills and then Ill be in real trouble.         Dr. Junig told the mechanic he would be summoned for surprise testing.         What worries me most are the needles the doctor said. But people die from cocaine you know. What you were doing  theres a genuine risk. If you get busted for cocaine you could end up in a situation where social services are involved. People lose their kids.         In late 2009 a discovery made in a Walgreens in Michigan lit up the forums where recovering addicts chat: Generic bupe!         The F.D.A. had just approved generic Subutex buprenorphine without the abuse deterrent despite Reckitt Benckisers effort to prevent it. It was according to that post about one-third the cost of brand-name Suboxone.         For the previous six years Reckitt Benckiser with the governments support had successfully discouraged Subutex except in special circumstances. Doctors and insurers told that Suboxone was safer had favored it.         But then Suboxone itself ended up being diverted misused and abused by injection indicating that the safeguard was not foolproof although Reckitt says it stands by it. So when uninsured patients clamored for the cheaper generic some doctors including Dr. Kolodny started accommodating them.         At first I did believe the marketing that there was a booby trap in there he said. But my impression is that it doesnt work as well as promised as an abuse deterrent.         The most recent data signal an escalating problem with buprenorphine.         Last year forensic laboratories identified 10804 drug seizures as buprenorphine up eightfold from 2006.         In 2011 emergency room visits for the nonmedical use of buprenorphine were estimated at 21483 nearly five times what they were in 2006. Also in 2011 poison centers recorded 3625 cases of toxic buprenorphine exposure nearly five times as high as the previous year.         More young children were hospitalized because of accidental ingestion of buprenorphine than for any other medication in 2010 and 2011 a federal study found. Another study financed by Reckitt of 2380 buprenorphine overdoses in young children found that 587 had to be hospitalized in intensive care units and that four died.         John Burke the president of the  National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators  said buprenorphine remains down on the totem pole of worrisome prescription drugs.         I wouldnt say buprenorphine is not a serious problem; its a product for addicts so the propensity for diversion is probably much higher than with the other prescription drugs he said. But oxycodone hydrocodone Xanax  those make up the bulk of the problem.         Even so many local authorities say buprenorphine is their nemesis.         What were seeing here in Delta County is really troubling said Steven C. Parks a prosecuting attorney in Michigan. Arrest after arrest of people who are possessing or abusing Suboxone who dont have a prescription for it who are shooting it up and who are snorting it.         Its what has followed the oxycodone and the hydrocodone trends here he added. We dont have heroin yet.         Mr. Parks said a big local pharmacy had stopped stocking the medication because its employees felt very threatened.         Pharmacy robberies for Suboxone alone are rare but they do happen.         In June Michelle Wilcox 27 wearing a hooded sweatshirt and surgical gloves handed a Maine pharmacy technician a note: Give me all the 8 mg Subs you have. I have a weapon and I will use it. She walked out with 84 doses of Suboxone  worth about $640  and drove off in a pickup truck only to be arrested within hours according to documents and interviews.         She was just desperate said Sheriff Scott Nichols of Franklin County Me. She said her own medication had been stolen.         Ms. Wilcox awaits sentencing after pleading guilty to felony robbery charges in federal court.         In Maine Ms. Katz the Portland health official described a seemingly unstoppable flow of Suboxone onto the streets in recent years with addicts injecting it. Shawn Verrill serving time for Miles Malones death from buprenorphine said he used to sell the drug in York Beach to supplement his income as a lobster deliveryman.         Every kid on the beach was looking for it he said. The high lasts all day.         Mr. Verrill said he bought cases of stop signs from a pharmacist and charged $10 to $12 for each orange hexagonal Suboxone tablet earning $4500 in a good month.         Most buprenorphine advocates interviewed said they believed that deaths were extremely rare. But Suboxone and Subutex were considered the primary suspect in 690 deaths  420 in the United States  reported to the F.D.A. from spring 2003 through September.         This pales in comparison with the 2826 deaths from methadone reported to the F.D.A. over roughly the same period as calculated by AdverseEvents a company that analyzes data on drug side effects. C.D.C. data drawn from death certificates makes it clear that number is a serious undercount. The C.D.C. does not track buprenorphine deaths which may also be undercounted.         The F.D.A. information which is spare does show that more than half the American buprenorphine deaths involved other substances and that only two of 224 cases specifying route of administration indicated injection  the primary concern of regulators.         Fifty deaths are listed as suicides and 69 involve unintentional overdoses drug abuse or drug misuse. Thirty were fetal or infant deaths after exposure in the womb.         Outside the United States 118 of the 270 deaths reported were in Sweden. Last year Swedens National Board of Forensic Medicine published an analysis of 100 autopsies where buprenorphine had been detected. In two-thirds it was the direct cause of death mostly in combination with other drugs. Swedish researchers attributed the fatal intoxication to low tolerance because of first-time use or a period of abstinence.         The F.D.A. cautions against assuming that a primary suspect drug was indeed a cause of death.         But Brian M. Overstreet the president of  AdverseEvents  said The reality is that hundreds of thousands of cases are reported every year by front-line health care providers who purposefully identify a drug as being the primary suspect cause of a specific adverse event.         We believe that the link between drug and event he continued is quite real.         Mr. Malones death remains hauntingly real for his family.         In July his mother told a federal judge: I try very hard to forget the last time that I saw him at his wake. He wasnt smiling at me. He didnt hug me. I touched his hand and he didnt touch me back.         Mr. Verrill pleaded guilty to the distribution of buprenorphine resulting in death. I feel guilty he said in the recent interview wearing

37,100000002566605,1,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,Sunday Review,Art Makes You Smart,BRIAN KISIDA;JAY P. GREENE;DANIEL H. BOWEN,,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/opinion/sunday/art-makes-you-smart.html,12,FOR many education advocates the arts are a panacea: They supposedly increase test scores generate social responsibility and turn around failing schools. Most of the supporting evidence though does little more than establish correlations between exposure to the arts and certain outcomes. Research that demonstrates a causal relationship has been virtually nonexistent.         A few years ago however we had a rare opportunity to explore such relationships when the  Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art  opened in Bentonville Ark. Through a large-scale random-assignment study of school tours to the museum we were able to determine that strong causal relationships do in fact exist between arts education and a range of desirable outcomes.         Students who by lottery were selected to visit the museum on a field trip demonstrated stronger critical thinking skills displayed higher levels of social tolerance exhibited greater historical empathy and developed a taste for art museums and cultural institutions.         Crystal Bridges which opened in November 2011 was founded by Alice Walton the daughter of Sam Walton the founder of Walmart. It is impressive with 50000 square feet of gallery space and an endowment of more than $800 million.         Thanks to a generous private gift the museum has a program that allows school groups to visit at no cost to students or schools.         Before the opening we were contacted by the museums education department. They recognized that the opening of a major museum in an area that had never had one before was an unusual event that ought to be studied. But they also had a problem. Because the school tours were being offered free in an area where most children had very little prior exposure to cultural institutions demand for visits far exceeded available slots. In the first year alone the museum received applications from 525 school groups requesting tours for more than 38000 students.         As social scientists we knew exactly how to solve this problem. We partnered with the museum and conducted a lottery to fill the available slots. By randomly assigning school tours we were able to allocate spots fairly. Doing so also created a natural experiment to study the  effects of museum visits  on students the results of which we published in the journals Education Next and  Educational Researcher .         Over the course of the following year nearly 11000 students and almost 500 teachers participated in our study roughly half of whom had been selected by lottery to visit the museum. Applicant groups who won the lottery constituted our treatment group while those who did not win an immediate tour served as our control group.         Several weeks after the students in the treatment group visited the museum we administered surveys to all of the students. The surveys included multiple items that assessed knowledge about art as well as measures of tolerance historical empathy and sustained interest in visiting art museums and other cultural institutions. We also asked them to write an essay in response to a work of art that was unfamiliar to them.         These essays were then coded using a critical-thinking-skills assessment program developed by researchers working with the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.         Further we directly measured whether students are more likely to return to Crystal Bridges as a result of going on a school tour. Students who participated in the study were given a coupon that gave them and their families free entry to a special exhibit at the museum. The coupons were coded so that we could determine the group to which students belonged. Students in the treatment group were 18 percent more likely to attend the exhibit than students in the control group.         Moreover most of the benefits we observed are significantly larger for minority students low-income students and students from rural schools  typically two to three times larger than for white middle-class suburban students  owing perhaps to the fact that the tour was the first time they had visited an art museum.         Further research is needed to determine what exactly about the museum-going experience determines the strength of the outcomes. How important is the structure of the tour? The size of the group? The type of art presented?         Clearly however we can conclude that visiting an art museum exposes students to a diversity of ideas that challenge them with different perspectives on the human condition. Expanding access to art whether through programs in schools or through visits to area museums and galleries should be a central part of any schools curriculum.

Interviews were in English or Spanish.         SSRS of Media Pa. conducted sampling interviewing and tabulation for the survey.         The sample of landline telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 81000 active residential exchanges across the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to ensure that each region of the country was represented in its proper proportion.         Within each exchange random digits were added to form a complete telephone number thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.         Cellphone numbers were generated by a similar random process. The two samples were then combined and adjusted to ensure the proper ratio of landline-only cellphone-only and dual-phone users.         Interviewers made multiple attempts to reach every phone number in the survey calling back unanswered numbers on different days at different times of both day and evening.         The combined results have been weighted to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region sex race Hispanic origin marital status age education and (for landlines) number of adults in the household. In addition the sample was adjusted to reflect the percentage of the population residing in mostly Democratic counties mostly Republican counties and counties more closely balanced politically.         In theory in 19 cases out of 20 overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all American adults. For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger. Shifts in results between polls over time also have a larger sampling error.         In addition to sampling error the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.         Variation in the wording order and translation of questions for example may lead to somewhat different results.         Michael R. Kagay of Princeton N.J. assisted The Times in its polling analysis.

Made of plywood walls on a concrete foundation of some 250 square feet with one door two windows and a corrugated zinc roof the squat structure is called a box shelter.         But  Lebanon  has banned box shelters regarding them as a threat to this already fragile nation. In the eyes of the Lebanese the box shelters made by the Danish Refugee Council look too permanent and could encourage the Syrians to stay.         The fear of permanence is very embedded in the Lebanese political psyche said Makram Malaeb a manager in the Syrian refugee crisis unit at the Ministry of Social Affairs. We had  Palestinian  refugees who were supposed to stay here for a month in 1948 and now they are a population of 500000. And we went through a 15-year civil war where the Palestinians were a large player.         Of the many factors complicating the worlds response to the Syrian refugee crisis none are perhaps more peculiar to the Middle East than Lebanons deep-seated fear of permanence. The Lebanese have so far rejected the establishment of any refugee camp citing their long troubled history with Palestinian camps on their soil. Acutely aware of the history of refugee housing  flimsy tents that metamorphosed over decades into concrete multistory dwellings  the Lebanese view even the most modest of new shelters for Syrians with suspicion.         Designs by other aid groups have also been rejected including one by Ikea the Swedish retailer of assemble-it-yourself furniture. Theirs may have been tweaked with soft walls less sturdy flooring and frames capable of quick dismantling but they still gave off the whiff of permanence.         Does the government want us to sleep in tents? asked Ahmed al-Hussein 18 a refugee who now lives in a box shelter.         As the Syrian neighbor most vulnerable to being drawn into the war there Lebanon has adopted a seemingly contradictory attitude toward the influx of Syrians. It has been the most welcoming accepting hundreds of thousands of refugees who along with the many Syrians already living in Lebanon now make up a quarter of the countrys population. And yet fearing that they will stay and disrupt the countrys delicate balance among Sunnis Shiites and Christians Lebanon has tried to minimize their presence.         The refugees who are mostly Sunni Muslims are now believed to rival Lebanese Christians in numbers and to have helped make Sunnis the nations dominant religious group.         Those fears have forced the refugees to try to squeeze into pre-existing buildings and blend into the landscape. Those with means rent apartments. But hundreds of thousands are living in garages and occupying the nooks and crannies of buildings under construction. Abandoned buildings including universities and shopping malls have been taken over in their entirety by refugees.         With the arrival of winter the politics of shelters has left legions of Syrians particularly vulnerable though relief organizations have been scrambling to deliver blankets heating fuel and other items. A severe winter storm was expected to sweep across northern and central Lebanon by midweek bringing heavy snow and fierce winds to areas with the poorest refugees.         The Danish Refugee Council began building the box shelters more than a year ago. Mindful of Lebanons sensitivities it struck deals with homeowners who accepted the construction of the shelters as an addition to their property; the shelters would belong to the homeowners after the refugees left.         But as the number of refugees swelled this year so did the shelters eventually totaling 160. The number was small given the total number of refugees but it was enough to unsettle the government.         They were concerned that we were building more and more of the box shelters said Imad Aoun a spokesman for the council. So we stopped a couple of months ago.         The government ordered the aid groups to stop building new shelters though existing ones were grandfathered.         Faisa Abdullah a Lebanese homeowner who had two box shelters planted in her back yard said the decision should be left to individual landlords.        
40,100000002585001,0,Article,News,World,world,europe,"Close to the Olympics, Far From the Bounty",STEVEN LEE MYERS,1131,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/world/europe/close-to-the-olympics-far-from-the-bounty.html,9,GULRIPSHI Georgia  A little less than three miles from Sochis main Olympic Stadium the site of the opening and closing ceremonies of the Winter Games in February the Psou River stands as Russias border with Georgia. But no one directly on either side of the derelict border post considers any part of the region Georgia.         It is the tiny starkly beautiful and sparsely populated enclave of Abkhazia which sundered itself from Georgia after a brutal war of ethnic cleansing 20 years ago. Since then though Georgia has never accepted its independence it has struggled for international recognition as a sovereign nation not merely an impoverished appendage of its huge neighbor and principal patron.         The awarding of the Olympics in 2007 to Sochi so tantalizingly close had for a time raised hopes that Abkhazia would share in the bounty that its political cause and its feeble economy would feel at least a trickle of the wealth and attention the Games inevitably attract. Maybe a few Olympic tourists would even make their way down the Black Sea coast.         Those hopes were largely misplaced.         Russia said that for security reasons it plans to bar all traffic from crossing the narrow bridge to and from Abkhazia from Jan. 7 through the Paralympic Games in March. Only a select few specially registered vehicles will be allowed to pass effectively locking out an enclave to which Russia has long provided political and economic succor.         The decision threatens to disrupt an indispensable link that brings vital products from Russia and carries Abkhazias main exports north  most notably its mandarin oranges just as they ripen heavily on the groves that cover the lush subtropical foothills overlooking the sea.         The border restrictions have left officials here scrambling to negotiate with their Russian counterparts to ensure sufficient supplies of products the region does not produce including flour meat medicines and gasoline as well as the uninterrupted flow of exports that provide the bulk of its revenues.         From Russia its practically everything Beslan F. Eshba Abkhazias deputy prime minister said in an interview in the regions governmental headquarters in the capital Sukhumi known officially here as Sukhum or in Abkhazian as Akua.         In Gulripshi a small village south of the capital the impending border restrictions have hastened a harvest that begins late in the fall and usually extends well into the new year. The mandarins and tangerines of Abkhazia and Georgia  as well as peaches persimmons figs and grapes  have an almost mythical nostalgia surrounding them that dates to the Soviet era when there were few exports from abroad. The oranges arrived in Moscow and other cities like a taste of the sun in the dark winter months.         In A Russian Journal written in 1948 John Steinbeck described passengers gorging themselves on fruit they bought from women outside the airport at Sukhumi for they were people of the north who never really had enough fruit. Even now when produce from around the world fills Russias markets the mandarins are revered.         In the foothills that rise from the coast a former Soviet-era collective formerly named Ilyich after Lenins patronymic and now known as Sophia has 47000 mandarin trees spread across more than 225 acres. Three hundred workers swarm the trees each day to pick the fruit by hand some of it early so that it can be sorted by size and crated by a machine installed in 1963 in order to beat the border closings.         Its an inconvenience of course said Ashot Minosyan the deputy agricultural minister of the regional government which still owns the farm.         Much of Abkhazia still seems frozen in a Soviet-like state the scars of its war with Georgia still visible in gutted and bullet-pocked buildings the failure of its economy evident in the abandoned resorts that once were the prize of the Soviet elite including Stalin and his secret police chief Lavarentiy Beria who was born in a village near Gulripshi.

RUBIN,420,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/world/africa/french-paratroopers-killed-in-central-african-republic.html,14,PARIS  President FranÃ§ois Hollande of France arrived Tuesday in the Central African Republic just hours after the French government announced the death of two French paratroopers. The paratroopers were part of the newly augmented French military force that arrived over the weekend to help stem the increasing violence in the country.         The two paratroopers who were 22 and 23 years old died in an exchange of fire late Monday night becoming the first two casualties since the French force which now totals 1600 troops arrived in the country.         They lost their lives to save many others Mr. Hollande said according to French news services.         Mr. Hollande stopped in  Bangui  the capital on his way back from South Africa where he had been attending the memorial service for Nelson Mandela.         The French forces goal is to bring a minimum of stability to the country which has been spiraling into a bloody chaotic civil war with both Muslims and Christians carrying out attacks on each other over the past eight months according to a statement released by Jean-Yves Le Drian the French defense minister.         In the last week alone more than 500 people have been killed in sectarian violence aid groups told The Associated Press.         The French forces will join African peacekeeping soldiers drawn from nearby countries who thus far have been unable to stabilize the situation. The Central African Republic was part of Frances colonial empire in Africa and the French have had a modest force of 400 troops there for some time.         The Central African Republics president Michel Djotodia took power in a coup last spring backed by the Seleka rebels who are now among one of the largest militias destabilizing the country.         The security conditions in Bangui are not good at all said a French official who was in Washington for consultations.         Seleka has hidden weapons in the city and is using them to carry out attacks the official added.         Adding to the security challenges the militia has been using uniforms taken from dead Central African Republic troops or acquired through other means.         On Monday in remarks directed at the Central African Republic President Obama called for calm.         The United States has promised to fly Burundian troops to the Central African Republic to help with security. A White House memorandum on Tuesday said the United States would provide as much as $60 million for equipment training and logistical support for the African-led peacekeeping effort there. The equipment is to be nonlethal in nature like uniforms and communications gear.        
42,100000002596038,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,media,"New York Court Won’t Order Fox Reporter to Testify, Shoring Up State Shield Law",LESLIE KAUFMAN,683,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/business/media/new-york-court-wont-order-fox-reporter-to-testify-shoring-up-state-shield-law.html,3,A New York State shield law protecting journalists was bolstered Tuesday when the states highest court refused to require a Fox News reporter to return to Colorado to testify in the case of James E. Holmes the man accused of shooting 12 people in July 2012 in a movie theater in Aurora Colo.         In unusually strong language the New York Court of Appeals wrote There is no principle more fundamental or well-established than the right of a reporter to refuse to divulge a confidential source. First Amendment experts said that the ruling written by a 4 to 3 majority on the court could make New York already the home to numerous media companies a kind of safe haven for journalists.         This is a ringing endorsement of New York shield law and establishes that it has real teeth said Elizabeth McNamara a media lawyer with the New York firm Travis Wright & Tremaine. The shield law goes back a long time and it has been a real element in establishing the publishing industry here in New York. This is an important decision in that it enforces the fact that journalists can make commitments to sources and they will be binding.         But Daniel N. Arshack of Arshack Hajek & Lehrman the New York counsel to Mr. Holmes called the decision unprecedented and dangerous. There is no prior case that carves out a kind of witness that will not be produced when requested by other states he said in a phone interview.         The ruling is only significant for state law and will have no effect on federal First Amendment cases.         After the shooting Jana Winter a New York-based employee of Fox News was sent to Aurora on assignment and reported that Mr. Holmes had sent a notebook full of details of how he was going to kill people to a psychiatrist before the attack.         Lawyers for Mr. Holmes subsequently asked for sanctions in his criminal case saying that the government had violated their clients rights by leaking the information while a gag order was in place. Law enforcement officials denied leaking the information and Mr. Holmess lawyers requested that the New York courts compel Ms. Winter to return to Colorado to testify to determine the truth of the situation.         The Manhattan Supreme Court a lower court granted a subpoena to do just that and Ms. Winter concerned that she would be jailed in Colorado for refusing to give up her sources appealed the case all the way to Albany. The highest courts ruling means that Ms. Winters trials are done according to her lawyer.         The case is over as far as Jana is concerned and there is no chance that she will be forced to testify said Dori Hanswirth of Hogan Lovells the lead lawyer for Ms. Winter. She emphasized the case was bigger than her client. It is certainly telling New York journalists that you are protected even if you travel outside of the state.         But Mr. Arshack said his side was still evaluating whether they had options under federal or Colorado law. In a written statement he elaborated further on his objections to letting the ruling stand unchallenged.         The decision undermines the ability of prosecutors and the defense alike across the country to compel the attendance of witnesses in criminal cases. This is a death penalty case in which the credibility of law enforcement witnesses may determine whether a man lives or dies. To withhold testimony which could affect that decision simply shocks the conscience he wrote.         Derigan Silver an assistant professor specializing in media law at the University of Denver said he agreed that the ruling set a precedent and one that enhanced New Yorks position as a safe haven for journalists.         It is a pretty strong opinion on principle he said. The judges are not just looking at the language of the statute they talk of tradition and common law and what makes New York special. If you read it that way it is kind of like saying Come here do your reporting from New York and we will protect you.Â         
43,100000002595851,0,Article,Op-Ed,Opinion,opinion,,Does Rising Inequality Make Us Hardhearted?,THOMAS B. EDSALL,1156,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/opinion/does-rising-inequality-make-us-hardhearted.html,,Over the course of American history support for economic redistribution has been the exception not the rule. In the 20th century support for redistributive policies emerged as a dominant force in national politics only in the Depression decade of the 1930s; it was intermittently influential from 1945 to 1965.         More recently a  2008 study  of public attitudes during periods of mounting inequality found that when inequality in America rises the public responds with increased conservative sentiment. This conservative shift applies to all income groups including the poor according to the political scientists Nathan Kelly of the University of Tennessee and Peter Enns of Cornell. Rather than generating opinion shifts that would make redistributive policies more likely Kelly and Enns write increased economic inequality produces a conservative response in public sentiment.         The Kelly-Enns study examines poll data and inequality trends between 1952 and 2006. In an email Enns wrote earlier this week he added that more recent data shows a continuation of the trend: between 2006 and 2011 (when the most recent data are available) inequality has mostly continued to increase and the public has shifted in a more conservative direction  especially since 2008. This relationship is consistent with our previous findings.         A key tool Kelly and Enns use for their work is a statistical analysis of the policy mood of the country developed by  James Stimson  of the University of North Carolina. Stimson using data from all available commercial and academic surveys including American National Election Studies and Gallup illustrated his findings in a graph  Figure 1  which covers the years 1952 to 2012. The graph tracks swings in public opinion both to the left and right using responses to polling questions measuring levels of support for government programs.         From 1992 to 2012 according to Stimsons analysis overall support for liberal pro-government initiatives has declined. These results suggest that President Obamas plan to dedicate the remainder of his term to reducing inequality to which he devoted  a major speech  last week will face significant political opposition inside and outside of Congress.         Obama argues that government action is required to redress the  growing disparity  between rich and poor  diminished opportunities  for upward mobility and  economic stagnation . Public opinion at least according to the Stimson analysis is moving in precisely the opposite direction.  A 2011 Pew Research Center survey  gives us a glimpse of some of the headwinds Obama faces. Pew found that among all voters capitalism (a rough proxy for deregulated markets) is viewed favorably by a 50-40 margin and socialism (a rough proxy for interventionist government) negatively by 60-31.         An exception according to Pew  illustrated in  Figure 2   lies in the views of black and Hispanic voters. Both groups hold more negative than positive views of capitalism: blacks 51-41 and Hispanics 55-32. Blacks hold a positive view of socialism 55-36; Hispanics by a modest 5 points a negative view 49-44. This Pew data suggests that pro-government activists of the kind Obama needs to back his inequality agenda remain a minority.         One of the crucial questions in determining likely support for or opposition to government initiatives to remediate inequality is whether a voter believes that people are poor because of their own bad choices or thinks that poverty is the result of what pollsters call circumstances: dangerous neighborhoods inadequate housing bad schools discrimination.         A  Pew survey  conducted in 2012 produced results that demonstrated the nations ambivalence on this question. The more voters blame poverty on a lack of effort by the poor themselves the more inclined they are to say that there are legions of undeserving poor for whom taxpayer-funded government programs are not warranted. The more a respondent blames poverty on external circumstances the more likely he or she is to support government action to remedy those circumstances.         Overall according to Pew 46 percent of the public does not fault the poor agreeing that their plight is the outcome of unfavorable circumstances while 38 percent are more judgmental declaring that poverty stems from a lack of individual effort.         This relatively modest 8-point difference among all voters masks very large partisan  and significant racial and ethnic  divisions. A decisive majority of Republicans (see Figure 3) 57-27 say that people are poor because of a lack of effort while an even larger majority of Democrats 61-24 say circumstances are the cause of poverty. Whites are split 41-41 while blacks back circumstances 62-28 as do Hispanics 59-27.         In his  Dec. 4 speech  at the pro-Democratic Center for American Progress Obama acknowledged the racial and ideological hurdles he faces. He told his audience:

But he is clearly reaching a higher level of distress as the  Rangers  keep losing at home.         After Nashvilles Nick Spaling opened the scoring Monday at 13 minutes 45 seconds of the first period Lundqvist fired the puck down the ice in frustration as the  Predators  celebrated in front of his crease. Lundqvist lowered his head in exasperation when Rich Clune made it 2-0 four minutes later and the Predators went on to a 4-1  victory  at Madison Square Garden.         The news was even worse for the Rangers after the game. Coach Alain Vigneault said right wing Ryan Callahan had sustained a second-degree sprain of the medial collateral ligament in his left knee which would keep him out of the lineup for four to six weeks. Callahan the Rangers captain was injured in the first period when he checked Nashvilles Victor Bartley and hit the boards awkwardly.         The Rangers (15-16-1) added the rugged forwards Arron Asham and Derek Dorsett  to add bite to the lineup as Vigneault put it before the game  but little moxie was evident as the Rangers lost a third straight game to open a nine-game homestand.         Right now its extremely tough mentally and you try to be positive you have to Lundqvist said. You have to work through it. Its definitely a test for all of us.         Rick Nash temporarily awakened the sleepy crowd at the renovated Garden when he scored a highlight-show goal for the Rangers at 6:38 of the second taking a slick cross-ice pass in front from Brad Richards at the left point before shooting the puck over Predators goaltender Carter Hutton. The goal was Nashs sixth of the season the 316th of his career and his 600th point.         But the Rangers put minimal pressure on Hutton the rest of the way as Nashville smothered their attack throughout the third period. Hutton made 28 saves for the Predators (14-14-3) who had lost five straight games.         We got beat by a team that plays a real structured game Vigneault said. We need to find ways to win whether that be getting a blocked shot at the right time or whether its a goal from our fourth line or defense.         After Predators center Matt Hendricks increased Nashvilles lead to 3-1 at 2:38 of the third Lundqvist angrily kicked the puck with his left skate toward the right boards and the Rangers bench.         The goaltender was watching from the bench when Paul Gaustad netted an empty-net goal at 18:54 completing the scoring.         The only thing I know right now is it can only go up Lundqvist said. I think its important that we try to analyze it after each game before we move on to try and learn something and try to improve.         Callahans prolonged absence will make the Rangers uphill climb that much more arduous. He missed the season opener while recovering from off-season shoulder surgery and then he fractured his thumb blocking a shot Oct. 16 costing him seven more games.         The Rangers were also without Marc Staal for the second straight game. Staal a 26-year-old defenseman was found to have a concussion after a collision with Reid Boucher of the Devils during Saturdays overtime loss.         Lundqvist who signed a seven-year $59.5 million contract extension last week lost for the third time in four games since the announcement. The 31-year-old franchise goaltender fell to 9-13-1 this season unusual territory for a player who is usually the Rangers most consistent.         The Rangers are 5-8-1 over all at home and 1-6-1 at the Garden since defeating Florida on Nov. 10. Their road record  after a 2-6 start  is 10-8.        
45,100000002596117,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,,New Leadership for Lululemon in Management Shake-Up,ELIZABETH A. HARRIS,864,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/business/new-leadership-for-lululemon-in-management-shake-up.html,1,Perhaps going on television and suggesting that women with large thighs were not the ideal customer  at least when it comes to yoga pants  would never be considered advisable for the top executive of an athletic wear company.         But those remarks just a month ago by  Lululemon Athletica s founder Dennis J. Wilson caused an uproar and capped a troubled year for the retailer as Mr. Wilson tried to explain problems with a sizable costly recall of yoga pants.         Two days before the company was to report its third-quarter earnings  Lululemon  announced on Tuesday that he would step down from his position as chairman of the board of directors although he remains on the board. Michael Casey the lead director will replace him as chairman and Laurent Potdevin who was most recently the president of TOMS Shoes was named to take over as chief executive from Christine Day who announced in June that she would be resigning.         A Canadian company that sells workout clothing like sports bras jackets and yoga pants that are generally considered high quality and on the more expensive side Lululemon has enjoyed considerable growth  with revenue rising to $1.4 billion in the year ending last February. But it has faced stiffening competition in the category of athletic apparel whose popularity is evident in the fields of stretchy fabrics now found at places like the Gap and elsewhere.         Although the companys stock price shot up during Ms. Days tenure from about $15 a share in 2008 to about $82 before her announcement it then dropped after a shareholders lawsuit contended that the company was concealing problems with those yoga pants.         Made of a fabric known as Luon the pants which made up 17 percent of the retailers bottoms for women  were discovered to be too sheer . But that was not learned until the pants were in stores and the costly recall caused the retailer considerable embarrassment.         At the time Ms. Day said that the truth of the matter is that the only way that you can actually test for the issue is to put the pants on and bend over.         And some months later in November as the company was trying to recover an interview Mr. Wilson who is known as Chip gave to Bloomberg Television revived the controversy and seemed to make it worse. In response to a question about Lululemons pants which were said to pill quickly Mr. Wilson said Â some womens bodies just actually dont work for yoga pants. The pilling he said was really about the rubbing through the thighs how much pressure is there.         His comments ricocheted around the web were the target of ridicule and prompted him to issue a taped apology which apparently failed to quell some worries that the companys reputation had faltered.         So much of what consumers say is now heard by a companys leadership said Marshal Cohen chief industry analyst at the NPD Group a retail research company. In the past who was I going to complain to my best friend? Big deal. Now a complaint can become viral.         Mr. Casey in an interview said that while the Lululemon founder would continue to be a presence he was not a spokesman for the company. Chip is the founder of Lululemon and thats certainly not going to change he said.         He added that Mr. Wilson would continue the company mission against mediocrity.         In 2011 the company made headlines with shopping bags emblazoned with Who is John Galt? The slogan is the opening line of Rands novel Atlas Shrugged which espouses free market capitalism and individualism.         And in 2007 the year Lululemon became a public company The New York Times  commissioned a laboratory test  of a shirt made of VitaSea a fabric that the company said was made with seaweed. The fabric releases marine amino acids minerals and vitamins into the skin upon contact with moisture the product labels said.         But in fact the shirts were made of cotton. No evidence of seaweed was found in that test or in others.         If you actually put it on and wear it it is different from cotton Mr. Wilson said when told of the results. Thats my only test of it.         As far as how the retail company would move forward under new management a few analysts questioned the choice of Mr. Potdevin who began his career at LVMH and was chief executive of Burton Snowboards from 2005 to 2010.         Sam Poser an analyst at Sterne Agee said that Mr. Potdevins background was in operations not in retailing. Ms. Day he said had great instincts on the retail side and not-as-great instincts on the operations side. I think they hired somebody who is almost the opposite.         And even as Lululemon tried to pitch the conversation into its next phase much of the initial response to its busy day of news centered on the past remarks of its departing chairman.         We view Wilsons departure as chairman as a positive Faye Landes an analyst at Cowen and Company said in a report to investors because he is obviously considered something of a loose cannon.         On Tuesday the stock opened at $71.83 and closed at $69.12.        
46,100000002596229,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,basketball,"Williams and Pierce Return, and So Does Nets’ Ability to Stay in a Game",ANDREW KEH,825,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/sports/basketball/williams-and-pierce-return-and-so-does-nets-ability-to-stay-in-a-game.html,17,When the Nets brought together all the luxurious parts that now constitute their wildly expensive roster point guard Deron Williams was presented as the engine that would propel the machine.         Was it any wonder that once he succumbed to a string of ankle injuries going on to miss more than half of the first 20 games the Nets would tumble to a 4-16 start?         The correlation may not be exact. The Nets have shown myriad problems over the last month. But Williams on Tuesday night made a clear statement as to how his mere presence can positively shape the Nets fortunes. Suiting up for the first time since Nov. 20 Williams scored 25 points and helped orchestrate the Nets 104-96 victory over the Boston Celtics at Barclays Center.         Hes the head of the snake said forward Paul Pierce who also came back from injury Tuesday. Hes one of the most important pieces of what were trying to do here. Were trying to build and trying to win a championship.         Williams 29 had sat out the Nets previous nine games while nursing a sprained left ankle. The same injury forced him to miss two games before his latest extended absence and before that a sprained right ankle kept him out of most of the teams preseason preparations.         Williams practiced only once before Tuesday and even he was unsure how he would play after so much time off. But the results were overwhelmingly positive. After averaging just 9 points 6 assists and 24.1 minutes through his first nine games Williams notched a season-high point total and added seven assists and three rebounds in 37 minutes.         When youre just helpless and your teams struggling and you cant pick them up and you cant do anything about it its definitely tough Williams said of his long absence.         Kevin Garnett praised Williams for how he battled the defensive pressure form Avery Bradley who scored 22 points for the Celtics.         You have to have savvy strong-minded point guards that understand flow understand rhythm Garnett said and I thought from the jump he did a great job taking the game understanding it and controlling it the whole game.         Most important Williams seemed to be at his best during the third quarter  the Nets bane this season  and ensured the team would not experience another late collapse.         The Nets had a 9-point lead at halftime but the Celtics hit their first five shots and went on a 13-4 run to tie the game 60-60. But lively play from Williams spurred the Nets resistance. First he went on a wavy drive to the basket and scored off the glass to restore the lead. On the Nets next possession he dribbled and flipped the ball to Garnett who sank an 18-footer. Williams had 9 points and 4 assists in the quarter and when it was over the Nets were leading big again 85-72.         It was something I couldnt do when I first came back at the start of the season Williams said about his aggressive driving performance. Thats how I want to play. Thats how I play.         If Williamss strong performance was a pleasant surprise so was the fact that Pierce was on the court at all. Pierce had missed the previous five games after fracturing a bone in his shooting hand Nov. 29. The Nets initially thought the injury would require a layoff of two to four weeks. But once it was determined last week that Pierce could not injure the hand further  and that playing would be a matter of pain tolerance  his timetable was drastically accelerated.         It was Pierces 1118th game as a professional though he started a game on the bench for just the fourth time in his career. Coach Jason Kidd hinted afterward that Pierce could continue to be used as a reserve and Pierce said that he would do whatever the team needed.         Wearing a black brace that left his fingers exposed Pierce took three shots and missed them all.         As I spent more time with it get to know it take it out to the movies I dont know have dinner with it Pierce began to say about the glove in a soliloquy that drew more laughs as it became more absurd we can get to know each other become comfortable with each other and then we can have a long run together.         The win it was clear had instilled a light mood in the locker room. Everything worked. Brook Lopez exploited his size advantage taking gargantuan steps time after time to score 24 points on 10-for-13 shooting. The Nets defense continued to absorb new principles installed after the demotion last week of the assistant coach Lawrence Frank.         But the biggest boon was Williams.         We werent playing those Brooklyn Nets that were playing those games without Deron Williams said Brad Stevens the Celtics coach. That was their team and that is a good team.        
47,100000002594654,0,Article,News Analysis,World,world,europe,Rise of Young Leaders Signals a Mandate for Political Change in Italy,JIM YARDLEY,869,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/world/europe/rise-of-young-leaders-signals-a-mandate-for-political-change-in-italy.html,15,ROME  For all its melodrama and theatrics Italian politics is often defined by what does not happen. The Italian Parliament has been deadlocked on major changes for years unable or unwilling to enact bills to overhaul the political system or unshackle the economy which has barely grown in two decades.         That is why the rise of Matteo Renzi the charismatic young mayor of Florence has sent a jolt through the landscape.         Mr. Renzi 38 on Sunday became the leader of the countrys biggest party the center-left Democrats winning a nationwide primary by an unexpectedly wide margin  nearly 70 percent of the 2.9 million primary voters supported him. The outpouring was interpreted by many analysts as an unequivocal mandate to shake things up.         This is so momentous said Franco Pavoncello a political analyst and president of  John Cabot University  in Rome. There has been a very strong resistance on the left to produce change.         Italy once ranked among the richest nations in Europe but it is suffering a prolonged economic downturn and persistent high unemployment even as most other European nations have been gathering steam. Government finances hamstrung by the euro crisis and its aftermath have made matters worse.         The malaise in Italy has fueled rising public anger and alienation which has proved to be a potent combination for the Five Star Movement the antigovernment anti-Europe party  led by the comedian Beppe Grillo . It rose from nowhere to win 25 percent of the vote in parliamentary elections in February.         Mr. Renzi is a different sort of outsider than Mr. Grillo. Though he is not part of the entrenched old guard of the Democratic Party his strategy is to work from within. He has promised to transform the party the bastion of some of the countrys most powerful entrenched interests  and then to change Italy.         Mr. Renzi has talked about confronting many of his partys sacred cows especially the labor unions. He wants to overhaul education and the government health system. He also talks about seeking consensus with conservative voters another idea rarely voiced by the left.         Only change can close the last 20 years and open that new season that the country needs wrote Ezio Mauro editor of the newspaper La Repubblica in a front-page editorial.         The question of course is how quickly Mr. Renzi can refashion his party and make a run for prime minister. The scale of his primary victory suggests that the time may be ripe to push for early elections. But analysts point to two reasons that Mr. Renzi is likely to wait.         First Italys highest court recently declared major parts of the countrys electoral system unconstitutional and called on Parliament to fix the problem. Second Italy already has a young prime minister from the Democratic Party  Enrico Letta .         Mr. Letta 47 leads the grand coalition government of rivals including parties from the center-left and center-right. Within the Democratic Party Mr. Letta has his own camp of allies and is regarded as a protÃ©gÃ© of President Giorgio Napolitano perhaps the most respected political figure in Italy.         Mr. Renzi and Mr. Letta are both moderates and analysts say their relationship could either make or break the party.         Roberto DAlimonte a political analyst and specialist on Italys election laws saw the potential for the two leaders to form the kind of testy but mostly effective partnership in Italy that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown once had in the Labour Party in Britain.         Italys voting system is famously complex and has been criticized for producing splintered results that lead to unwieldy unstable governing coalitions lacking either a popular mandate or shared interests.         Analysts say that Mr. Renzi knows he could not achieve his goals with such a coalition and that he wants voters to be able to choose lawmakers more directly. But to introduce such a system Mr. Renzi will have to strike a deal with rivals  possibly with Angelino Alfano the deputy prime minister in the government who is emerging as the next-generation leader of the center-right.         It was Mr. Alfano 43 who led the rebellion of younger center-right lawmakers against Silvio Berlusconi in October after Mr. Berlusconi a conservative former prime minister tried to bring down the coalition government. Now Mr. Berlusconi 77  has been expelled  from the Senate while Mr. Alfanos colleagues are positioning themselves for the future.         Italys European neighbors have watched it with apprehension this year fearing that the political instability in a country that was deemed too big to fail in the financial crisis could now derail the tentative economic recovery elsewhere in the Continent.         Mr. Berlsuconi was a focus of the worries. Now his fall and the rise of leaders like Mr. Letta Mr. Alfano and especially Mr. Renzi illustrates that a new generation is finally assuming power in Italy.         Capturing the moment in an article called The Seventies are Over Mario Calabresi editor of La Stampa a national newspaper based in Turin wrote that it was still too soon to tell if the new leaders would be more capable than the old.         But we know that they could be different Mr. Calabresi wrote on Tuesday more in tune with the society we live in and its demands.        
48,100000002596211,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,basketball,Knicks Talk Good Game but Don’t Play It,SCOTT CACCIOLA,862,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/sports/basketball/knicks-shake-up-fails-to-rattle-irving.html,13,CLEVELAND  The  Knicks  lost any sense of stability long ago. Cracks formed when Tyson Chandler broke his right leg during the teams fourth game of the season and the season has been a patchwork quilt ever since  a ragged ripping-at-the-seams patchwork quilt.         So on Tuesday night hard by the frigid banks of Lake Erie Coach Mike Woodson once again dusted off his roster and assembled a new starting five his eighth of the season. The lineup that took the court against the  Cleveland Cavaliers  was born of equal parts necessity (too many injuries) and desperation (too many losses).         But while Woodson was able to change his personnel he could not change the result. The game merely felt like more of the same as the Knicks fell again their 109-94 loss at Quicken Loans Arena featuring the usual assortment of problems: poor defense poor shooting poor decisions.         I dont want to keep using embarrassmentÂ   Carmelo Anthony  said explaining that he had already used the word too often this season. But right now the losing is just becoming unacceptable. Hopefully everybody feels like that. I cant be the only one thats feeling like that.         In any case the Knicks are operating on a limited spectrum these days  a scale of sadness that ranges from embarrassing to unacceptable  and they are at a loss for solutions. They talk about improving their effort. They talk about playing tougher defense. They talk about making shots. Then they struggle to do any of it.         Their inaction is casting an even harsher spotlight on Woodson though Anthony said the coach was not to blame. We got to help him figure it out he said.         Anthony scored 29 points but had little help. Andrea Bargnani and J. R. Smith combined to shoot 10 of 31 from the field. Making matters worse Raymond Felton reinjured his left hamstring and played only 20 minutes. He said he doubted he would be able to play Wednesday against the Chicago Bulls.         Kyrie Irving was dominant for the Cavaliers (8-13) collecting 37 points and 11 assists. He shot 14 of 23 from the field and his teammates followed his lead. Cleveland shot 56.8 percent over all. Irving drained two of his four 3-point attempts in the fourth quarter.         Its like kicking a man when hes down Smith said.         After the Knicks erased an 18-point deficit in the first half the game quickly got away from them in the third quarter. Irving scored 7 points during an 11-2 run that extended the Cavaliers lead to 64-54.         The Knicks kept compounding their mistakes. Later in the quarter Smith streaked up the court like a champagne cork got into the lane turned and fired a pass straight into Irvings hands. The Cavaliers Tristan Thompson followed with a jump shot and Clevelands lead continued to swell.         We got to understand our principles Amare Stoudemire said. Coach Woodson gives us the game plan and a lot of times we deviate from that plan.         With the Knicks trailing by 18 early in the fourth Iman Shumpert tossed up a 3-pointer that barely grazed the front of the rim. It was that kind of night.         It was the Knicks fourth game in six days an adventure-filled stretch that featured blowout victories over the Nets and the Orlando Magic as well as Sundays 41-point loss to the Boston Celtics. So Tuesdays game  a mid-December contest against a middling opponent in northern Ohio  set up as an unlikely pressure cooker for them.         Kenyon Martin sat out his second straight game with what the team described as a sore left ankle. It was more than apparent that the Knicks had missed his toughness against the Celtics and Woodson gave Metta World Peace his first start of the season to help shore things up. At least that was the hope. World Peace finished with 2 points and 2 rebounds in 19 minutes.         Woodson made another change instructing Shumpert to defend Irving one of the quicker players in the league. It was a stiff challenge for Shumpert who was caught on a screen on the games opening possession and could only watch as Irving sailed past him for a layup. The Knicks offered zero help defense.         It was a microcosm of another horrid first quarter for the Knicks as the Cavaliers scored 14 straight points. Irving was at his kinetic best.         He causes havoc on anybody Woodson said.         As poorly as they had played though the Knicks were somehow able to climb back into contention. Pablo Prigioni provided a spark off the bench feeding Stoudemire for a layup and drilling a 3-pointer. Smith and Felton made a pair of fine defensive plays (not a misprint).         The Cavaliers led by 3 at halftime and the game felt competitive. The feeling did not last long.         Anthony said he would continue to be upbeat with his teammates no matter the circumstances.         I dont know how to fake the funk he said. Im a real straightforward person. So yes I am remaining positive.         Losing hurts he said adding But I will remain positive.         That alone might be the Knicks most impressive achievement to date.

Mr. Kubitschek long thought to have died in a car accident on the highway between SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro was killed as a result of his driver being shot in the head said Gilberto Natalini the commissions president. Mr. Natalini said the commission based its conclusion on the testimony of witnesses and other evidence including a metal fragment found in the cranium of the driver Geraldo Ribeiro when his body was exhumed in 1996.         The SÃ£o Paulo commission one of various such entities in Brazil examining abuses by the military dictatorship had  sought to exhume Mr. Ribeiros remains  in recent months as part of its investigation but delivered its report without doing so.         Its findings will be sent to federal authorities and the National Truth Commission which is also looking into Mr. Kubitscheks death. Even if prosecutors open an investigation into the matter and eventually charge individuals with killing Mr. Kubitschek a 1979 amnesty law  still shields from prosecution those responsible  for politically motivated crimes during the period of military rule.        
50,100000002596024,0,Article,News,Business Day,business,media,Gannett to Add USA Today to Local Papers,CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY,606,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/business/media/gannett-to-add-usa-today-to-local-papers.html,4, Gannett Company  one of the nations largest newspaper chains will try to expand its advertising and circulation revenue by inserting parts of its flagship newspaper USA Today into its local newspapers.         The company is expected to announce its plans Wednesday morning at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference.         Beginning in January Gannett will add 12 to 14 pages of USA Today content each day to 35 newspapers in its largest markets including The Journal News in White Plains N.Y. The Tennessean in Nashville and The Cincinnati Enquirer. That means readers along with their local news will get a broader mix of news from the USA Today content.         Gannett has been testing the program at four papers  in Indianapolis; Rochester; Fort Myers Fla.; and Appleton Wis.  since October and plans to add the new markets throughout the first quarter of 2014. Eventually it plans to extend the program to all of its 81 local newspaper markets.         The plan represents a major move for Gannett which experienced a deep dip in third-quarter advertising revenue this year compared with 2012 when it benefited from advertising associated with the Olympics and the presidential election season. By incorporating USA Today into local papers Gannett is able to increase the national papers circulation by roughly 1.5 million readers during the week and 2.5 million readers on Sundays and then try to sell advertising against these larger numbers.         According to the Alliance for Audited Media USA Today has 2.876 million weekday readers for both the print and digital editions with just over 1.3 million of those for the printed paper. Larry Kramer USA Todays publisher noted that as fewer readers buy or subscribe to both a local newspaper and a national one the inserts enable Gannett to offer a single product that provides wider coverage.         The USA Today inserts will include national and financial news as well as lifestyle coverage; additional sports news will be integrated into the local sports sections.         The research we did gave us a very strong belief that customers see much higher value having these newspapers combined Mr. Kramer said. We also think that advertisers want to reach that audience.         Asked whether prices would rise for subscribers receiving the extra USA Today content a Gannett spokesman Jeremy Gaines said As we introduce enhanced products consumers tell us they are willing to pay for the added value were bringing them.         Gannetts announcement represents a shift for a company that recently has focused on expanding its broadcast holdings. In June Gannett  bought the Belo Corporation  for about $1.5 billion in cash and added 20 television stations to the 23 it already owned. Mr. Kramer said that while the company was applying a television network affiliate model to its papers the company remained committed to its newspaper assets which would still provide roughly 30 to 40 percent of its revenue.         We still have a significant business in newspapers and we have to treat it the way you treat any business he said. We felt like we had to invest in it.         Gannett executives said they tested the new inserts in 23 markets and quickly learned that while readers liked their news content blended into a single paper they wanted their national money and life coverage contained in separate sections.         The plans follow a transition that has been taking place at Gannett where Gracia Martore is the president over the last 18 months. During that period USA Today underwent a redesign created a national news desk to coordinate its broader coverage for its papers and introduced pay walls. The latest model will also be rolled out across Gannetts newspaper websites.        
51,100000002596191,0,Article,News,Sports,sports,baseball,"New Posting System Likely to Delay, Not Sink, Sale of a Japanese Ace",DAVID WALDSTEIN,870,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/sports/baseball/new-posting-system-likely-to-delay-not-sink-sale-of-a-japanese-ace.html,15,LAKE BUENA VISTA Fla.  It is hard to quantify what Masahiro Tanaka did for the Rakuten Eagles and the city of Sendai last season when he led the team to a Japan Series title. But there is little doubt the Eagles think it is more than $20 million.         Yozo Tachibana the Eagles president arrived at Major League Baseballs winter meetings Tuesday and said no decision had been made on whether to post  Tanaka  a pitcher coveted by the Yankees among other teams. But Tachibana made it clear that the Eagles were unhappy that the new posting system which is expected to be approved by M.L.B.s executive committee next week establishes a maximum posting fee of $20 million.         Under the old system the Eagles could have expected bids of $50 million or more with the winning bid going directly to the team.         Of course a little bit disappointed for us Tachibana said.         Tachibana also said he would return to Japan next week and meet with Tanaka who went 24-0 with a 1.27 earned run average during the regular season for Rakuten before deciding whether to post him. He said he did not know Tanakas preference.         No one knows Tachibana said.         In recent interviews in Japan Tachibana indicated that with a $20 million maximum posting fee the Eagles preference is to keep Tanaka 25 who was instrumental in a championship that provided an uplift to a region still struggling after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.         Bobby Valentine who managed against Tanaka in Japans Pacific League from Tanakas rookie season in 2007 through 2009 and who has insight into the nuances of player procurement between Japan and the United States predicted that the Eagles would allow Tanaka to leave.         I say he will definitely be posted yes Valentine said. Tachibana will talk to him personally and then will come out of the meeting saying that they are doing the right thing for the player for the team and for the country.         Valentine did not see Tanaka during his 2013 campaign which included a save in the series-clinching game one day after he threw 160 pitches in Game 6. But Valentine managed the Chiba Lotte Marines during Tanakas first three seasons when he was 35-20 with a 3.20 E.R.A. from ages 18-20.         Valentine said Tanakas stuff now was basically the same as then.         Hes got a good fastball and his split looks like a really hard strike and then it suddenly becomes a ball Valentine said. I dont know how you hit it; I could never figure it out.         Hes just a very good pitcher and his stuff will certainly translate over here.         The Yankees are one of several teams expected to submit a bid for Tanaka assuming he is posted. If several teams post the maximum bid Tanaka can negotiate with any of them as if he were a free agent. With the more affordable $20 million maximum fee many more teams are expected to submit bids.         In addition under the new system more of the money spent on a player like Tanaka would go toward his contract and would count against baseballs luxury tax as opposed to the posting fee which is exempt from the tax. Despite having signed the free agents Brian McCann Jacoby Ellsbury and Carlos Beltran this off-season the Yankees are under the $189 million payroll threshold for luxury tax purposes and would like to remain under it if possible while fielding a championship-caliber team.         The Yankees need another starter and Tanaka is the most appealing potentially available pitcher with the most potential. General Manager Brian Cashman said he had been looking for a starter via trade and free agency. It would be easier to sign one than trade for one Cashman said but the Yankees are not impressed with the pitchers available on the market.         With Ellsbury and Beltran the Yankees have six outfielders including Brett Gardner Alfonso Soriano Ichiro Suzuki and Vernon Wells. Cashman acknowledged that since he had signed Ellsbury and Beltran teams had been calling about Gardner.         That boomerang came around quick and everyone has made phone calls on Gardy Cashman said. So we have an obligation to hear what everyones interest may be. But we were not shopping Gardy.         Cashman also said he has been fielding calls on starter Ivan Nova and the catching prospects Gary Sanchez and J. R. Murphy.         INSIDE PITCH         Brian Cashman indicated for the first time publicly that the Yankees planned to retire Joe Torres No. 6 jersey soon and said he was thrilled that Torre was elected to the Hall of Fame. We havent given it out for a reason Cashman said Tuesday referring to No. 6. Its been tucked away for quite some time. At some point that will happen no doubt about it. After Torre left to manage the Los Angeles Dodgers after the 2007 season there appeared to be some resentment over the circumstances and later in his book The Yankee Years he was at times critical of Cashman and the Yankees. Whatever acrimony may have existed was soothed over long ago though and Cashman said he sent Torre a congratulatory text message Monday as soon as it was announced that Torre had been elected.        
52,100000002594781,0,Article,News,U.S.,us,,"After Setbacks, Online Courses Are Rethought",TAMAR LEWIN,1170,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/us/after-setbacks-online-courses-are-rethought.html,1,Two years after a Stanford professor drew 160000 students from around the globe to a free online course on artificial intelligence starting what was widely viewed as a revolution in higher education early results for such large-scale courses are disappointing forcing a rethinking of how college instruction can best use the Internet.         A study of a million users of massive open online courses known as MOOCs  released  this month by the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education found that on average only about half of those who registered for a course ever viewed a lecture and only about 4 percent completed the courses.         Much of the hope  and hype  surrounding MOOCs has focused on the promise of courses for students in poor countries with little access to higher education. But a separate survey from the University of Pennsylvania released last month found that about 80 percent of those taking the universitys MOOCs had  already earned a degree  of some kind.         And  perhaps the most publicized MOOC experiment  at San Jose State University has turned into a flop. It was a partnership announced with great fanfare at a January news conference featuring Gov. Jerry Brown of California a strong backer of online education. San Jose State and  Udacity  a Silicon Valley company co-founded by a Stanford artificial-intelligence professor Sebastian Thrun would work together to offer three low-cost online introductory courses for college credit.         Mr. Thrun who had been unhappy with the low completion rates in free MOOCs hoped to increase them by hiring online mentors to help students stick with the classes. And the university in the heart of Silicon Valley hoped to show its leadership in online learning and to reach more students.         But the pilot classes of about 100 people each failed. Despite access to the Udacity mentors the online students last spring  including many from a charter high school in Oakland   did worse  than those who took the classes on campus. In the algebra class fewer than a quarter of the students  and only 12 percent of the high school students  earned a passing grade.         The program was suspended in July and it is unclear when if or how the program will resume. Neither the provost nor the president of San Jose State returned calls and spokesmen said the university had no comment.         Whatever happens at San Jose even the loudest critics of MOOCs do not expect them to fade away. More likely they will morph into many different shapes: Already San Jose State is getting good results using videos from  edX  a nonprofit MOOC venture to supplement some classroom sessions and edX is producing videos to use in some high school Advanced Placement classes. And  Coursera  the largest MOOC company is experimenting with using its courses along with a facilitator in small discussion classes at some United States consulates.         Some MOOC pioneers are working with a different model so-called connectivist MOOCs which are more about the connections and communication among students than about the content delivered by a professor.         Its like The MOOC is dead long live the MOOCÂ  said Jonathan Rees a Colorado State University-Pueblo professor who has expressed fears that the online courses would displace professors and be an excuse for cuts in funding. At the beginning everybody talked about MOOCs being entirely online but now were seeing lots of things that fall in the middle and even I see the appeal of that.         The intense publicity about MOOCs has nudged almost every university toward developing an Internet strategy.         Given that the wave of publicity about MOOCs began with Mr. Thruns artificial-intelligence course it is fitting that he has become emblematic of a reset in the thinking about MOOCs after a  profile in Fast Company magazine  that described him as moving away from college classes in favor of vocational training in partnerships with corporations that would pay a fee.         Many educators saw the move as an admission of defeat for the idea that online courses would democratize higher education  and confirmation that at its core Udacity a company funded with venture capital was more interested in profits than in helping to educate underserved students.         Sebastian Thrun put himself out there as a little bit of a lightning rod said George Siemens a MOOC pioneer who got funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for research on MOOCs and last week convened the researchers at the University of Texas at Arlington to discuss their early results. Whether he intended it or not that article marks a substantial turning point in the conversation around MOOCs.         The profile quoted Mr. Thrun as saying the Udacity MOOCs were a lousy product and not a good fit for disadvantaged students unleashing a torrent of commentary in the higher-education blogosphere.         Mr. Thrun took issue with the article and said he had never concluded that MOOCs could not work for any particular group of students.         I care about education for everyone not just the elite he said in an interview. We want to bring high-quality education to everyone and set up everyone for success. My commitment is unchanged.         While he said he was super-excited about working with corporations to improve job skills Mr. Thrun said he was working with San Jose State to revamp the software so that future students could have more time to work through the courses.         To all those people who declared our experiment a failure you have to understand how innovation works he  wrote on his blog . Few ideas work on the first try. Iteration is key to innovation. We are seeing significant improvement in learning outcomes and student engagement.          Some draw an analogy to mobile phones which took several generations to progress from clunky and unreliable to indispensable.         Mr. Thrun stressed that results from the second round of the San Jose experiment over the summer were much improved with the online algebra and statistics students doing better than their on-campus counterparts. Comparisons are murky though since the summer classes were open to all and half the students already had degrees.         Some San Jose professors said they found the MOOC material useful and were disappointed that the pilot was halted.         We had great results in the summer so Im surprised that its not going forward said Julie Sliva who taught the college algebra course. Im still using the Udacity videos to support another course because theyre very helpful.         Mr. Siemens said what was happening was part of a natural process. Were moving from the hype to the implementation he said. Its exciting to see universities saying Fine you woke us up and beginning to grapple with how the Internet can change the university how it doesnt have to be all about teaching 25 people in a room.         Now that we have the technology to teach 100000 students online he said the next challenge will be scaling creativity and finding a way that even in a class of 100000 adaptive learning can give each student a personal experience.        
53,100000002596128,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Telling a Dark Story to Offer Some Light,ELI ROSENBERG,905,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/nyregion/telling-a-dark-story-to-offer-some-light.html,29,Its not always easy for Sylvia Anderson to tell her tale. But she believes strongly in sharing it with the world nonetheless.         Though her movement is now limited by her obesity and the heart and lung problems she suffers after years of addiction to crack cocaine she said she likes getting out of her apartment to recount the story of her life to anyone willing to listen.         You cant just go out there and pull people off the street Ms. Anderson 53 said. So you go out there and just speak.         Now free from drugs and living in Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn Ms. Anderson occasionally goes down to the waiting room of the doctors office below her apartment preaching to the women she believes are confronted by the same dual scourges that left her life upended for so long: domestic abuse and drug addiction.         It is not that her tale has the perfect ending. It is just that she knows how hard it can be to transcend such circumstances particularly when they are lived in combination with each other.         For Ms. Anderson the abuse came first. Born in Queens in 1960 she was married at 17 to a man who would father her first child but soon began to beat her she said. After she left him in 1982 she said she fell into another abusive 10-year relationship with a different man with whom she had two children. She left him in 1992 but not before he had introduced her to drugs which she described as a coping mechanism for the pain of being physically abused.         Sometimes when I was getting beat up I was all high and I didnt even feel the punches she said. I didnt want to feel and being on so much I didnt have to.         She had two more children with a third man. All five of her children were removed from her custody by the Administration for Childrens Services after her last child Darnell was born in 1995 weighing under four pounds and showing the effects of the drugs she was using. She said she regained custody of her children in 2001 after an 18-month drug rehabilitation program only to lose them again to foster care soon thereafter. She was addicted to crack cocaine off and on for 14 years and spent much of that time homeless.         During her time on the streets Ms. Anderson saw things she could not forget. She can picture she said the dog fights held in a dilapidated house in the Bronx where she once saw a pit bull nearly rip the face off another one; she remembers the wealthy man at a Sheepshead Bay hotel who would pay women living on the streets to watch him take drugs; she vividly recalls the loan shark who threw a man out a fifth-story window in Harlem.         My addiction took me through so many horrible things she said adding that she shared the darker parts of her story because somebody might grasp on to something and I might get somebody clean.         Ms. Anderson finally got off drugs in 2006.         I was tired of the streets she said. I wanted to feel like those people in church.         Her children are now battling their own demons. Two are in prison and another is on probation. Ms. Anderson requires the presence of a part-time home aide five days a week a positive airway pressure machine to help her breathe at night and nine medications which she takes for her heart migraine headaches asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She received a pacemaker in 2012.         Darnell her youngest child was discharged to her from foster care around this time and since then Ms. Anderson has been working at making a home for the two of them at her $134-a-month apartment. She receives $797 in Supplemental Security Income every month as well as $189 in food stamps.         Money that she spent on a bed and clothing for Darnell as well as to an alternate energy provider that she said proved to be a scam resulted in her falling behind on her payments to Consolidated Edison no small risk for a woman who relies on a respiratory machine as well as an emergency medical services pendant.         On the verge of having her power cut off Ms. Anderson contacted the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies one of the seven organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The organization gave her a grant of $563 from the fund in August to pay her electricity bill.         Ms. Anderson said she was happy at home with her son and spent her days watching soap operas writing letters to her children in prison and occasionally going to church. She said she was trying to lose weight and hoped to save enough money to buy a juicer as well as a computer to better connect her with the world outside. She is close to her mother whom she admires for never giving up on her.         She and Darnell who has received his high school equivalency diploma and works at a survey company go to counseling together every Friday. Ms. Anderson said Hes such a good kid I just cant believe it.         She said they have a mantra. We say every morning to each other Thank God for waking us up in the right state of mind because a lot of people didnt wake up this morning.Â 

55,100000002596019,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,City Council Approves an Ice Center for the Bronx,WINNIE HU,664,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/nyregion/city-council-approves-an-ice-center-for-the-bronx.html,29,The Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx will soon be reinvented as a national ice sports center under a plan that was approved on Tuesday by the  City Council .         The project to be called the Kingsbridge National Ice Center caps years of efforts by city officials and community leaders to redevelop a cavernous building that was completed in 1917 and has become an enduring symbol of the Bronxs struggles. The vote came after city officials brokered a last-minute deal that won over Councilman Fernando Cabrera who represents the area by calling for the developer KNIC Partners to provide an additional $470000 to address traffic and parking issues and to support businesses and local students.         The ice center is scheduled to open in 2017 and will eventually include in its 763000 square feet nine ice rinks a 5000-seat arena dedicated space for community activities and a free after-school program with tutoring and skating lessons. It is expected to create at least 260 permanent jobs and 890 construction jobs in a county with the highest unemployment rate in the state.         This project is a victory for everyone involved and represents the type of development we can see when everyone works together for the greater good said Ruben Diaz Jr. the Bronx borough president.         The ice center also represents a victory for Mayor  Michael R. Bloomberg  as he leaves office. His administration had backed a 2009 plan to transform the armory into a shopping mall which was rejected by the Council amid protests by Bronx officials and residents that it would promote low-paying jobs and compete with local merchants.         What is now an abandoned structure will soon become the worlds largest indoor ice rink facility Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement Tuesday and it will serve as yet another example of our administrations commitment to turning what were once symbols of New York Citys decline  McCarren Park Pool High Bridge the High Line and more  into community treasures and international attractions.         This time the ice center garnered wide support within the Bronx but received mixed signals from Mr. Cabrera whose vote was important to secure the approval of the other council members. At a Council hearing last week Mr. Cabrera said he could not back the project and urged his fellow members to vote against it.         In recent weeks  Mr. Cabreras motives have come under scrutiny  after revelations that he had unsuccessfully demanded that the developer KNIC Partners pay $100000 a year for 99 years to a little-known organization Community Action Unlimited which has been associated with Mr. Cabrera a minister and his church New Life Outreach International. Mr. Cabrera has declined to explain his actions or his involvement with the group.         Mr. Cabrera said Tuesday that he decided to vote for the ice center after administration officials reached out the day before to address his remaining concerns about its effects on traffic parking and businesses. Ive always been for the project Mr. Cabrera said. I just wanted to take a good project and make it better.         Under the plan the ice center will be paid for entirely with $320 million in private money invested by KNIC Partners which was founded by Kevin Parker a former Wall Street executive and includes the former New York Rangers star Mark Messier. KNIC Partners will pay the city $1 a year to lease the armory as well as 5 percent of its annual gross revenue bringing the city an estimated $1 million a year.         KNIC Partners has promised to pay every worker a living wage  which amounts to at least $10 an hour with benefits or $11.50 an hour without benefits  and to give hiring preference to Bronx residents as part of a community benefits agreement that it voluntarily negotiated with a coalition of 27 local groups calling themselves the Kingsbridge Armory Redevelopment Alliance. It also plans to set aside $1 million annually to pay for free ice time for underprivileged children local residents and nonprofit organizations.        
56,100000002594950,0,Article,News,World,world,asia,"Effort to Help Filipino Women Falters, U.N. Says",SARAH WHEATON,953,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/world/asia/effort-to-help-filipino-women-falters-un-says.html,4,WASHINGTON  A new effort to protect women from rape and help them deliver babies in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines remains troubled and inadequate the United Nations and international aid groups said this week.         The effort loosely coordinated among more than a dozen developed countries aid groups and the United Nations is aimed at assisting 65000 women deemed at risk of sexual assault and an estimated 1000 women giving birth a day in regions ravaged by the typhoon in November.         Were on a big learning curve said Justine Greening Britains international development secretary. What were trying to do is make sure that going forward we put the real focus on women and girls and keeping them safe in a way that hasnt happened in the past enough.         Ms. Greening was the convener of a  conference in London last month   by coincidence held just days after the typhoon churned over the Philippines  when 13 governments including the United States agreed to assume that women and girls are in greater danger of violence after natural disasters than men and boys and that organizations should act quickly to prevent and treat it rather than waiting for confirmation that it has occurred.         But the money for the effort in the Philippines is flowing slowly. The United Nations Population Fund has asked its donor nations and agencies to contribute $30 million to give Filipino women hundreds of thousands of kits with hygiene supplies hire staff at 80 temporary maternal wards and counsel victims of rape. So far it has commitments for only about $3 million.         I was a bit disappointed about the lukewarm response from donors said Ugochi Daniels a top humanitarian aid coordinator for the United Nations.         Still Ms. Daniels said the $3 million commitment  from Britain Australia and the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund  marked a record. I dont think weve ever gotten more than $300000 she said.         The hygiene supplies do not include condoms typically part of such kits for fear of angering local communities. Nor are relief workers supplied with emergency contraception like the morning-after pill which is illegal in the Philippines.         Sexual health has always been tricky when it comes to emergency situations said Nora Murat the director for the International Planned Parenthood Federation in the region that includes the Philippines.         But advocates are applauding what they say is improved coordination among the contributing organizations and the speedy arrival in the Philippines of specialists to make sure that evacuation centers have better lighting safe spaces where women can congregate separately and gender-segregated bathrooms with locks on the doors.         I think theres the political will to do a better job and I think the Philippines is giving us an immediate opportunity to test that will Ms. Greening said.         The United States has not pledged any money to the population funds effort but Nancy Lindborg the assistant administrator for democracy conflict and humanitarian assistance at the United States Agency for International Development said the agency insisted that programs that are part of its $30 million in disaster aid to the Philippines show that they are incorporating measures to protect women.         Some experts expressed skepticism about the agencys approach however. When you talk about integrated protection accountability to women and girls goes out the window said Heidi Lehmann the director of the Womens Protection and Empowerment unit of the International Rescue Committee. That requires specialized specific gender-based violence programming. It is not realistic she said to think that you can add a bullet point to the shelter guys job description.         After the conflict in Bosnia in the early 1990s in which an estimated 60000 women were raped the  Inter-agency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises  said that women in war zones or disaster areas should be provided with birth kits contraception obstetrics care and counseling. Yet over the past two decades that help has been delivered sporadically if at all.         Women who barter sex for food and water remain a major concern officials said. To combat the rise in trafficking that has occurred in past disasters in the Philippines the American agency has increased its funding to programs that warn families about the dangers. The goal Ms. Lindborg said is so theyre not taken in by that great job offer in Manila that your 16-year-old daughter is being recruited for. Even before the typhoon an estimated 375000 women and girls in the area  about 10 percent of women of childbearing age affected by the storm  would have likely experienced sexual violence in their lifetimes United Nations officials said. Based on studies of emergencies they said that Haiyans aftermath could add another 65000 victims of sexual assault.         In Tacloban the hardest-hit major city the city administrator Tecson Lim said last week that the police had been unable to confirm rumors of rapes and sexual assaults in the days and weeks following the typhoon.         A drastic decrease in Taclobans population after the storm has helped reduce the risk of sexual violence in the city Mr. Lim said at a news conference. He said at least half the population left after the storm and had not returned and those who left were mainly those categorized by the city as vulnerable: women children older people and anyone with an illness or disability. Pedestrians are now overwhelmingly men in Tacloban City.         But relief officials working near Tacloban dismissed the idea that the threat to women had dissipated. Ms. Daniels of the United Nations Population Fund said that of the 1300 police officers deployed there only two were women.         At the news conference Mr. Lim promised to search for ways to make it easier for women to report sex crimes.        
57,100000002596111,0,Article,News,N.Y. / Region,nyregion,,Port Authority Investigating New Jersey Lane Closings,KATE ZERNIKE;WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM,316,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/nyregion/port-authority-investigating-new-jersey-lane-closings.html,25,The inspector general of the  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  opened an investigation on Tuesday into the sudden closing of three lanes on the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge in September which caused huge traffic backups and the actions of a close associate of Gov.  Chris Christie  who ordered the shutdown.         Officials in Fort Lee N.J. which turned into a parking lot when local access lanes to the bridge were closed on the first day of school have charged that the closings were retaliation against the boroughs mayor a Democrat who had declined to endorse Mr. Christie a Republican for re-election.         Michael Nestor the deputy inspector general and director of investigations at the Port Authority confirmed the inquiry and another official with knowledge of the matter said it would seek to determine whether any crimes had been committed and whether there was any abuse of authority or gross mismanagement.         At a legislative hearing in Trenton on Monday two Port Authority employees said that they were told to close the lanes by David Wildstein a high school classmate of Mr. Christies and a former political blogger who worked as director of interstate capital projects; Mr. Christies chief appointee at the authority created the position for him.         They said Mr. Wildstein instructed them not to tell anyone leaving in the dark Fort Lee officials the news media and the Port Authoritys executive director. They said they advised against the move but complied because they feared for their jobs and understood that Mr. Wildstein was working at the behest of Mr. Christies appointee Bill Baroni.         Mr. Baroni had previously testified that the lanes were closed as part of a traffic study. But the Port Authority employees and the executive director Patrick J. Foye testified that there was no traffic study.         Mr. Wildstein said on Friday that he would step down on Jan. 1.
