As part of the <a href="http://dssg.io">Eric & Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship</a>, this summer I worked with a team of data scientists to help the Chicago Dept of Public Health combat lead poisoning in Chicago children.  
<br />
We developed a predictive model to proactively identify lead hazards in Chicago homes, and I created an interactive web app for Department officials to navigate and interact with their inspections data. The app and its content are not currently available to the public, but the link below is an excerpt from the app source code.
