<span class="header">About this Site</span>
<p>We were intrigued by the <a href="http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Reality Commons Project</a> produced by the  <a href="http://hd.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Human Dynamics Laboratory</a>, particularly the Social Evolution dataset.  That research was published as:</p>

<div class="reference"><a href="http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/download.php?file=healthstatecomm.pdf" target="_blank">Sensing the 'Health State' of a Community</a>, A. Madan, M. Cebrian, S. Moturu, K. Farrahi, A. Pentland, Pervasive Computing, Vol. 11, No. 4, pp. 36-45 Oct 2012</div>

<p>
    We liked this project and dataset because, although information on social interactions is traditionally collected through surveys, the Reality Commons project used hard data collected from cell phones, Bluetooth devices, and WiFi access points to track the participants' interactions.  This was supplemented with survey data to give a fuller picture of the participants.  Thanks to the MIT Human Dynamics Lab, we had access to data about the participants' proximities to each other, phone calls and text messages to each other, and their survey results about preferences regarding politics, music, eating habits, exercise habits, campus activities, and other topics.

    The data was available in a suite of comma-delimited files, which we manipulated via python scripts to create data structures we could use in our visualizations (for example, the chord diagram requires a square matrix).  We used javascript and d3.js to create the force-directed graph, chord diagram, and heatmaps displayed on this site.  (For details on how to use the site, see the User Guide tab).

<span class="header">Process Book</span>
<p>We maintained a Process Book throughout the design and construction of this project.  It's basically a journal of our work.  You can view it <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yi1khIkyS18Cdb-qm6afbqT-BCXXPzC4NhV9NZyg0x8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>, or by clicking on the screenshot below.
